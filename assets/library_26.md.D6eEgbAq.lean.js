He ruled during the deadly Nigerian Civil War, which resulted in the death of 3 million people, most which were civilians. He took power after the 1966 Nigerian counter-coup and was overthrown in the 1975 Nigerian coup d'√©tat. Early life Gowon is an Ngas (Angas) from Lur, a small village in the present Kanke Local Government Area of Plateau State. His parents, Nde Yohanna and Matwok Kurnyang, left for Wusasa, Zaria as Church Missionary Society (CMS) missionaries in the early days of Gowon's life. His father took pride in the fact that he married the same day as the future Queen Mother Elizabeth married the future King George VI. Gowon was the fifth of eleven children. He grew up in Zaria and had his early life and education there. At school Gowon proved to be a very good athlete: he was the school football goalkeeper, pole vaulter, and long distance runner. He broke the school mile record in his first year. He was also the boxing captain.Daily Trust, 19 October 2004 (Chief Sunday Awoniyi). Military career Gowon joined the Nigerian Army in 1954, and received his commission as a second lieutenant on 19 October 1955, his 21st birthday. He has trained in the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, UK (1955‚Äì56), Staff College, Camberley, UK (1962) as well as the Joint Staff College, Latimer, 1965. He saw action in the Congo (Zaire) as part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, both in 1960‚Äì61 and in 1963. He advanced to battalion commander rank by 1966, at which time he was still a lieutenant colonel.  Rise to power   1966 Nigerian coup d'√©tat  Further information: 1966 Nigerian coup d'√©tat In January 1966, he became Nigeria's youngest military chief of staff at the age of 31, because a military coup d'√©tat by a group of junior officers under Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu led to the overthrow of Nigeria's civilian government.US Library of Congress ‚Äì \\"The 1966 Coups, Civil War, and Gowon's Government\\". In the course of this coup, mostly northern and western leaders were killed, including Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Nigeria's Prime Minister; Sir Ahmadu Bello, Sardauna of Sokoto and Premier of the Northern Region; and Samuel Akintola, Premier of the Western Region, Lt Col Arthur Unegbe and so many more. The then Lieutenant Colonel Gowon returned from his course at the Joint Staff College, Latimer UK two days before the coup ‚Äì a late arrival that possibly exempted him from the coupist hit list.Reflections on the Nigerian Civil War By Raph Uwechue Success in twentieth century world affairs since 1919(Murray 1974 and 1983) and the subsequent failure by Major General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi (who was the head of state following the January 1966 coup-with Gowon his Chief of Staff) to meet Northern demands for the prosecution of the coup plotters further inflamed Northern anger. There was significant support for the coup plotters from both the Eastern Region as well as the mostly left-wing \\"Lagos-Ibadan\\" press. Then came Ironsi's Decree Number 34, which proposed the abolition of the federal system of government in favor of a unitary state, a position which had long been championed by some Southerners-especially by a major section of the Igbo- dominated NCNC. This was perhaps wrongly interpreted by Northerners as a Southern (particularly Ibo) attempt at a takeover of all levers of power in the country. The North lagged badly behind the Western and Eastern regions in terms of education (partially due to Islamic doctrine-informed resistance to western cultural and social ethos), while the mostly-Igbo Easterners were already present in the federal civil service.  1966 Nigerian counter coup  Further information: 1966 Nigerian counter-coup The original intention of Murtala Mohammed and his fellow coup-plotters seems to have been to engineer the secession of the Northern region from Nigeria as a whole, but they were subsequently dissuaded of their plans by several advisors, amongst which included a number of high-ranking civil servants and judges, and importantly emissaries of the British and American governments who had interests in the Nigerian polity. The young officers then decided to name Lieutenant Colonel Gowon, who apparently had not been actively involved in events until that point, as Nigerian Head of State. On ascent to power Gowon reversed Ironsi's abrogation of the federal principle.Frederick Forsyth, Biafra Story, Leo Cooper, 2001.  Head of State (1966‚Äì1975)  In 1966, Gowon was chosen to become head of state. Up until then, Gowon remained strictly a career soldier with no involvement whatsoever in politics, until the tumultuous events of the year suddenly thrust him into a leadership role, when his unusual background as a Northerner who was neither of Hausa nor Fulani ancestry nor of the Islamic faith made him a particularly safe choice to lead a nation whose population was seething with ethnic tension.  Civil War leadership  In anticipation of eastern secession, Gowon moved quickly to weaken the support base of the region by decreeing the creation of twelve new states to replace the four regions. Six of these states contained minority groups that had demanded state creation since the 1950s. Gowon rightly calculated that the eastern minorities would not actively support the Igbos, given the prospect of having their own states if the secession effort were defeated. Many of the federal troops who fought in the Nigerian Civil War, also known as the Biafran War, to bring the Eastern Region back to the federation, were members of minority groups. The war lasted thirty months and ended in January 1970. In accepting Biafra's unconditional cease-fire, Gowon declared that there would be no victor and no vanquished. In this spirit, the years afterward were declared to be a period of rehabilitation, reconstruction, and reconciliation. The oil-price boom, which began as a result of the high price of crude oil (the country's major revenue earner) in the world market in 1973, increased the federal government's ability to undertake these tasks. There arose tension between the Eastern Region and the northern controlled federal government led by Gowon. On 4‚Äì5 January 1967, in line with Ojukwu's demand to meet for talks only on neutral soil, a summit attended by Gowon, Ojukwu and other members of the Supreme Military Council was held at Aburi in Ghana, the stated purpose of which was to resolve all outstanding conflicts and establish Nigeria as a confederation of regions. The outcome of this summit was the Aburi Accord. The Aburi Accord did not see the light of the day, as the Gowon led government had huge consideration for the possible revenues, especially oil revenues which were expected to increase given that reserves having been discovered in the area in the mid-1960s. It has been said without confirmation that both Gowon and Ojukwu had knowledge of the huge oil reserves in the Niger Delta area, which today has grown to be the mainstay of the Nigerian economy. In a move to check the influence of Ojukwu's government in the East, Gowon announced on 5 May 1967 the division of the 3 Nigerian regions into 12 states: North-Western State, North-Eastern state, Kano State, North-Central State, Benue-Plateau State, Kwara State, Western State, Lagos State, Mid-Western State, and, from Ojukwu's Eastern Region, a Rivers State, a South-Eastern State, and an East- Central State. The non-Igbo South-Eastern and Rivers states which had the oil reserves and access to the sea, were carved out to isolate the Igbo areas as East-Central state. One controversial aspect of this move was Gowon's annexing of Port Harcourt, a large city in the Niger Delta, in the South of Nigeria (the Ikwerres and Ijaws), sitting on some of Nigeria's largest reserves, into the new Rivers State, emasculating the migrant Igbo population of traders there. The flight of many of them back to their villages in the \\"Igbo heartland\\" in Eastern Nigeria where they felt safer was alleged to be a contradiction for Gowon's \\"no victor, no vanquished\\" policy, when at the end of the war, the properties they left behind were claimed by the Rivers State indigenes. Minority ethnicities of the Eastern Region were rather not sanguine about the prospect of secession,Africa Today, Reflections on the Nigerian Civil War by Raph Uwechue. as it would mean living in what they felt would be an Igbo-dominated nation. Some non-Igbos living in the Eastern Region either refrained from offering active support to the Biafran struggle, or actively aided the federal side by enlisting in the Nigerian army and feeding it intelligence about Biafran military activities. However, some did play active roles in the Biafran government, with N.U. Akpan serving as Secretary to the Government, Lt. Col (later Major-General) Philip Effiong, serving as Biafra's Chief of Defence Staff and others like Chiefs Bassey and Graham-Douglas serving in other significant roles. On 30 May 1967, Ojukwu responded to Gowon's announcement by declaring the formal secession of the Eastern Region, which was now to be known as the Republic of Biafra. This was to trigger a war that would last some 30 months, and see the deaths of more than 100,000 soldiers and over a million civilians, most of the latter of which would perish of starvation under a Nigeria-imposed blockade. The war saw a massive expansion of the Nigerian army in size and a steep increase in its doctrinal and technical sophistication, while the Nigerian Air Force was essentially born in the course of the conflict. However, significant controversy has surrounded the air operations of the Nigerian Forces, as several residents of Biafra, including Red Cross workers, foreign missionaries and journalists, accused the Nigerian Air Force of specifically targeting civilian populations, relief centers and marketplaces. Gowon has steadfastly denied those claims, along with claims that his army committed atrocities such as rape, wholesale executions of civilian populations and extensive looting in occupied areas; however, one of his wartime commanders, Benjamin Adekunle seems to give some credence to these claims in his book, while excusing them as unfortunate by- products of war. The end of the war came about on 13 January 1970, with Colonel Olusegun Obasanjo's acceptance of the surrender of Biafran forces.Olusegun Obasanjo, My Command, Ibadan/London/Nairobi' Heinemann, 1980, pp. 124-131. The next day Obasanjo announced the situation on the former rebel radio station Radio Biafra Enugu. Gowon subsequently declared his famous \\"no victor, no vanquished\\" speech, and followed it up with an amnesty for the majority of those who had participated in the Biafran uprising, as well as a program of \\"Reconciliation, Reconstruction, and Rehabilitation\\", to repair the extensive damage done to the economy and infrastructure of the Eastern Region during the years of war.Gowon's 12 January Speech Welcoming Biafran Surrender Unfortunately, some of these efforts never left the drawing board. In addition to this, Gen. Gowon's administration's policy of giving 20 pounds to Biafran who had a bank account in Nigeria before the war, regardless of how much money had been in their account, was criticised by foreign and local aid workers, as this led to an unprecedented scale of begging, looting and robbery in the former Biafran areas after the war.  Post-war boom  The postwar years saw Nigeria enjoying a meteoric, oil-fueled, economic upturn in the course of which the scope of activity of the Nigerian federal government grew to an unprecedented degree, with increased earnings from oil revenues. Unfortunately, however, this period also saw a rapid increase in corruption, mostly bribery, of and by federal government officials; and although the head of State himself, Gen. Gowon, was never found complicit in the corrupt practices, he was often accused of turning a blind eye to the activities of his staff and cronies.  Nigerianisation  Another decision made by Gowon at the height of the oil boom was to have what some considered negative repercussions for the Nigerian economy in later years, although its immediate effects were scarcely noticeable ‚Äì his indigenization decree of 1972, which declared many sectors of the Nigerian economy off-limits to all foreign investment, while ruling out more than minority participation by foreigners in several other areas. This decree provided windfall gains to several well- connected Nigerians, but proved highly detrimental to non-oil investment in the Nigerian economy.  National politics  On 1 October 1974, in flagrant contradiction to his earlier promises, Gowon declared that Nigeria would not be ready for civilian rule by 1976, and he announced that the handover date would be postponed indefinitely. Furthermore, because of the growth in bureaucracy, there were allegations of rise in corruption. Increased wealth in the country resulted in fake import licenses being issued. There were stories of tons of stones and sand being imported into the country, and of General Gowon himself saying to a foreign reporter that \\"the only problem Nigeria has is how to spend the money she has.\\"  Corruption  The corruption in Gowon's administration culminated in the notorious \\"cement armada\\" in the summer of 1975, when the port of Lagos became jammed with hundreds of ships trying to unload cement. Somehow, agents of the Nigerian government had signed contracts with 68 different international suppliers for the delivery of a total of 20 million tons of cement in one year to Lagos, even though its port could only accept one million tons of cargo per year.National Am. Corp. v. Federal Republic of Nigeria, 597 F. 2d 314 (2nd Cir. 1979). Even worse, the poorly drafted cement contracts included demurrage clauses highly favorable to the suppliers, meaning that the bill began to skyrocket if the ships sat in port waiting to unload (or even if they sat in their home ports waiting for permission to depart for Nigeria). The Nigerian government did not fully grasp the magnitude of its mistake until the port of Lagos was so badly jammed that basic supplies could not get through. By that time it was too late. Its attempts to repudiate the cement contracts and impose an emergency embargo on all inbound shipping tied up the country in litigation around the world for many years, including a 1983 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court.Verlinden BV v. Central Bank of Nigeria, .  1975 Nigerian coup d'√©tat  Further information: 1975 Nigerian coup d'√©tat These scandals provoked serious discontent within the army. On 29 July 1975, while Gowon was attending an OAU summit in Kampala, a group of officers led by Colonel Joe Nanven Garba announced his overthrow. The coup plotters appointed Brigadier Murtala Muhammad as head of the new government, and Brigadier Olusegun Obasanjo as his deputy. Later life Gowon subsequently went into exile in the United Kingdom, where he acquired a PhD in political science as a student at the University of Warwick. His main British residence is on the border of north London and Hertfordshire, where he has very much become part of the English community in his area. He served a term as Churchwarden in his parish church, St Mary the Virgin, Monken Hadley. In February 1976, Gowon was implicated in the coup d'√©tat led by Lt. Col Buka Suka Dimka, which resulted in the death of the now Gen Murtala Mohammed. According to Dimka's \\"confession\\", he met with Gowon in London, and obtained support from him for the coup. In addition, Dimka mentioned before his execution that the purpose of the Coup d'√©tat was to re-install Gowon as Head of State. As a result of the coup tribunal findings, Gowon was declared wanted by the Nigerian government, stripped of his rank in absentia and had his pension cut off. Gen Gowon was finally pardoned (along with the ex-Biafran President, Emeka Ojukwu) during the Second Republic under President Shehu Shagari. Gowon's rank (of general) wasn't restored until 1987 however by General Ibrahim Babangida. Furthermore, Gen. Gowon is also involved in the Guinea Worm Eradication Programme as well as the HIV Programme with Global Fund of Geneva. Gowon founded his own organization in 1992 called the Yakubu Gowon Centre. The organization is said to work on issues in Nigeria such as good governance as well as infectious disease control including HIV/AIDS, guinea worm, and malaria. In November 2004, Gowon won World Peace Prize Top Honor (awarded by World Peace Prize Awarding Council) for maintaining national stability, promoting economic growth, and organizing a symbolic peace conference in the African region.World Peace Prize Top Honer Prize Yakubu Gowon WPPAC.(21 November 2007) Personal life Gowon married Miss Victoria Zakari, a trained nurse in 1969 at a ceremony officiated by Seth Irunsewe Kale at the Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos.

Governance The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Toronto, currently Thomas Christopher Collins, acts as the chancellor of the institute. The Praeses (or president) of the Institute is Richard Alway, who was formerly president of St. Michael's College. History It was founded in 1929 as the Institute of Mediaeval Studies at St. Michael's College of the University of Toronto. √âtienne Gilson, then of the Sorbonne, was instrumental in its foundation, along with Henry Carr and Edmund J. McCorkell of the Congregation of St. Basil and St. Michael's College. In 1939 it was granted a pontifical charter by Pope Pius XII, by which it was given the power to grant licenciate and doctorate degrees in medieval studies. In 1964 the University of Toronto established the Centre for Medieval Studies as part of the School of Graduate Studies, for students pursuing a master's degree or doctorate in medieval studies. Teaching at these levels gradually passed from the Institute to the Centre. (The Centre officially uses the spelling \\"medieval\\" while PIMS uses \\"mediaeval\\".) Students of the Centre for Medieval Studies have access to the PIMS building and library. Up until 1958 the institute had its own charter. From 1958 to 2005, PIMS was a division of St. Michael's College. The Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies Act of 2005 gave the institute academic autonomy from the university. Under the act, PIMS is administered by a board of governors with its academic affairs vested in the Institute Council of the academic staff, consisting of fellows and associate fellows. Postdoctoral Program and Licence in Mediaeval Studies In 1998 the institute became an exclusively postdoctoral research centre, and it accepts students who have recently completed their doctoral studies and wish to conduct specialized research in medieval studies. PIMS offers a Licence in Mediaeval Studies (LMS) as a degree exclusively for students who have completed their postdoctoral studies there. (The application for the LMS refers to it as a \\"Licentiate\\" and not as a \\"Licence.\\") Unusually for a Pontifical licentiate, the degree is awarded after its bearer has already earned a doctorate, and not on the way to such. √âtienne Gilson Lecture Since 1979 the institute has hosted an annual lecture from \\"a senior medievalist\\" in honour of its co-founder and his research interests. Previous lecturers include Jaroslav Pelikan, Mark D. Jordan, John F. Wippel, Peter Brown, and Francis Oakley. Lectures have been given on topics such as medieval philosophy, medieval art, medicine in the Middle Ages, and medieval historiography. Library The institute has its own library with over 150,000 volumes, one of the largest collections of medieval documentation in North America. The library is part of the larger system of the University of Toronto Libraries. The library contains over 9,000 reels of microfilm and over 60,000 slides. Materials are non-circulating, and use of the library is generally restricted to PIMS and Centre for Medieval Studies faculty, researchers, and graduate students, though visitor passes may be obtained by contacting the library itself. Publishing PIMS also has an extensive publishing program that includes its annual journal of research on the Middle Ages, Mediaeval Studies, which began in 1939. A collection of Gilson Lectures focusing on Thomas Aquinas was published in 2008.

The Alaska boundary dispute was a territorial dispute between the United States and the United Kingdom, which then controlled Canada's foreign relations. It was resolved by arbitration in 1903. The dispute had existed between the Russian Empire and Britain since 1821, and was inherited by the United States as a consequence of the Alaska Purchase in 1867. The final resolution favored the American position, as Canada did not get an all-Canadian outlet from the Yukon gold fields to the sea. The disappointment and anger in Canada was directed less at the United States, and more at the British government for betraying Canadian interests in favor of healthier Anglo-American relations.Gibson (1943)  Background  1825‚Äì1898 In 1825 Russia and Britain signed a treaty to define the borders of their respective colonial possessions, the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1825. Part of the wording of the treaty was that: The vague phrase \\"the mountains parallel to the coast\\" was further qualified thus: This part of the treaty language was an agreement on general principles for establishing a boundary in the area in the future, rather than any exact demarcated line. Signed in 1839, the RAC‚ÄìHBC Agreement created an understanding between the Russian-American Company and the Hudson's Bay Company. Typically referred to as the lisi√®re (edge), a stretch of the Alaskan Panhandle from Cross Sound to 54¬∞ 40‚Ä≤ was given to the HBC as a fur trade monopoly in exchange for the agricultural and pastoral products produced by its subsidiary, the Puget Sound Agricultural Company, along with an annual amount of furs given to the Russian company. The lease was renewed until the end of Russian America. This lease was later brought up by the Province of British Columbia as bearing upon its own territorial interests in the region, but was ignored by Ottawa and London.\\"The Dryad Affair: Corporate Warfare and Anglo-Russian Rivalry for the Alaskan Lisi√®re\\", J. W. Shelest, ExploreNorth.com website The United States bought Alaska in 1867 from Russia in the Alaska Purchase, but the boundary terms were ambiguous. In 1871, British Columbia united with the new Canadian Confederation. The Canadian government requested a survey of the boundary, but the United States rejected it as too costly; the border area was very remote and sparsely settled, and without economic or strategic interest. In 1898, the national governments agreed on a compromise, but the government of British Columbia rejected it. U.S. President McKinley proposed a permanent lease to Canada of a port near Haines, but Canada rejected that compromise. Klondike gold rush In 1897‚Äì98 the Klondike Gold Rush in Yukon, Canada, enormously increased the population of the general area, which reached 30,000, composed largely of Americans. Some 100,000 fortune seekers moved through Alaska to the Klondike gold region. The presence of gold and a large new population greatly increased the importance of the region and the desirability of fixing an exact boundary. Canada wanted an all-Canadian route from the gold fields to a seaport. There are claims that Canadian citizens were harassed by the U.S. as a deterrent to making any land claims., report to David McEwen Eberts, Attorney-General of British Columbia. The head of Lynn Canal was the main gateway to the Yukon, and the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) sent a detachment to secure the location for Canada. This was based on Canada's assertion that that location was more than ten marine leagues from the sea, which was part of the 1825 boundary definition. A massive influx of American stampeders through Skagway very quickly forced the Canadian police to retreat. They set up posts on the desolate summits of Chilkoot and White Passes, complete with a mounted Gatling gun at each post. This was still disputed territory, as many Americans believed that the head of Lake Bennett, another north, should be the location of the border. To back up the police in their sovereignty claim, the Canadian government also sent the Yukon Field Force, a 200-man Army unit, to the territory. The soldiers set up camp at Fort Selkirk so that they could be fairly quickly dispatched to deal with problems at either the coastal passes or the 141st meridian west. Arbitration The posts set up on the passes by the NWMP were effective in the short term, as the provisional boundary was accepted, if grudgingly. In September 1898, serious negotiations began between the United States and Canada to settle the issue, but those meetings failed. The treaty of 1825 was drawn up in French, and the 1903 British advocates discussed the exact meaning of words like \\"/coast\\", \\"/strip\\" and \\"/crest\\". The maps of George Vancouver, which were used as a fixing line by the commission of 1825, showed a continuous line of mountains parallel to the coast ‚Äî however, the mountain range is neither parallel to the coast nor continuous. Finally, in 1903, the Hay‚ÄìHerbert Treaty between the United States and Britain entrusted the decision to an arbitration by a mixed tribunal of six members: three Americans (Elihu Root, Secretary of War; Henry Cabot Lodge, senator from Massachusetts; and George Turner, ex-senator from Washington), two Canadians (Sir Louis A. Jette, Lieutenant Governor of Quebec; and Allen B. Aylesworth, K.C., from Toronto), and one Briton (Baron Alverstone). All sides respected Root, but he was a member of the U.S. Cabinet. Canadians ridiculed the choice of the obscure ex-Senator Turner and, especially, Lodge, a leading historian and diplomatic specialist whom they saw as unobjective. The tribunal considered six main points: * Where the boundary began. * What \\"Portland Channel\\" meant, and how to draw the boundary line through it. Four islands were in dispute. * The definition of the line from \\"the southernmost point of Prince of Wales Island to Portland Channel\\", which depended on the answer to the previous question. * The line from Portland Channel to the 56th parallel north. * The width of the (border or edge), and how to measure it. * Whether mountain ranges existed in the area. The British member Lord Alverstone sided with the U.S. position on these basic issues, although the final agreed demarcation line fell significantly short of the maximal U.S. claim (it was a compromise falling roughly between the maximal U.S. and maximal Canadian claim). The \\"BC Panhandle\\" (the Tatshenshini-Alsek region) was not quite exclaved from the rest of British Columbia. In 1929 Canadian scholar Hugh L. L. Keenlyside concluded, \\"The Americans, of course, did have the better case.\\" He judged that most of the tribunal's decisions were fair. Regarding the key issue of the islands in the Portland Channel, however, This was one of several concessions that Britain offered to the United States (the others being on fisheries and the Panama Canal). It was part of a general policy of ending the chill in Britain‚ÄìU.S. relations, achieving rapprochement, winning American favor, and resolving outstanding issues (the Great Rapprochement).Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers (1987) p 251 Aftermath Growth of a distinct Canadian identity Keenlyside and Brown wrote that The Canadian judges refused to sign the award, issued on 20 October 1903, due to the Canadian delegates' disagreement with Lord Alverstone's vote. Canadians protested the outcome, not so much the decision itself but that the Americans had chosen politicians instead of jurists for the tribunal, and that the British had helped their own interests by betraying Canada's. This led to intense anti-British emotions erupting throughout Canada (including Quebec) as well as a surge in Canadian nationalism as separate from an imperial identity.John A. Munro, \\"English-Canadianism and the Demand for Canadian Autonomy: Ontario's Response to the Alaska Boundary Decision, 1903\\". Ontario History 1965 57(4): 189‚Äì203. Although suspicions of the U.S. provoked by the award may have contributed to Canada's rejection of a free trade with the United States in the 1911 \\"reciprocity election\\", historian F. W. Gibson concluded that Canadians vented their anger less upon the United States and \\"to a greater degree upon Great Britain for having offered such feeble resistance to American aggressiveness. The circumstances surrounding the settlement of the dispute produced serious dissatisfaction with Canada's position in the British Empire.\\"Gibson (1943) at notes 60‚Äì61 Infuriated, like most Canadians, Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier explained to Parliament, \\"So long as Canada remains a dependency of the British Crown the present powers that we have are not sufficient for the maintenance of our rights.\\"Joseph Schull, Laurier (1965) pp 431‚Äì32 Canadian anger gradually subsided, but the feeling that Canada should control its own foreign policy may have contributed to the Statute of Westminster.

Life He was the son of Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester and Elizabeth Hastings. On 3 March 1628, he succeeded his father and became the 5th Earl of Worcester. cites Brought up a Protestant, he converted to Catholicism as a young man. He was considered an outstandingly wealthy peer, with an income, by the contemporary estimate of Richard Symonds, of ¬£24,000 per annum. By good management, as well as by inheritance and marriage, he built up major holdings in property. When war came, he claimed to have expended and lent over ¬£900,000 to the royalist cause. Charles I asked him to keep a low profile in public life. Some noted recusants, such as Gwilym Puw and his chaplain Thomas Bayly, gathered around him at Raglan Castle. His local support was increased by the fact that he was not identified as a courtier. For his financial support of King Charles I at the outset of the First English Civil War, he was created 1st Marquess of Worcester, on 2 November 1642. After the battle of Naseby, King Charles sought refuge at Raglan, in the period June to September 1645. The next year, the Marquess was forced to surrender Raglan Castle to the forces of Sir Thomas Morgan, 1st Baronet, late in 1646, marking the effective end of the Civil War in Wales. He was taken into custody by the Parliamentary forces, and died in Covent Garden, on 18 December 1646.

Located on the Curonian Spit between the Curonian Lagoon and the Baltic Sea, it is the westernmost point of Lithuania and the Baltic states, close to the border with the Russian Kaliningrad Oblast exclave. It currently has about 2,385 residents.  History  Beach and dunes near Nida (2013) A settlement area of the Baltic Curonians, the original place called nida (\\"fluent\\" in the Old Prussian language) was first mentioned in 1385 documents issued by the Teutonic Knights, who ruled the lands within their Monastic State. The original settlement on the road along the Curonian Spit from K√∂nigsberg to Memel was located about south of its today's position near the Hohe D√ºne (High Dune) at Cape Grob≈°tas (from Old Prussian: grabis, \\"hill\\"). The fishing village became part of the Duchy of Prussia in 1525 and of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. In 1709 nearly all of the population died from a bubonic plague epidemic. Continuously threatened by sand drifts, the village was moved away from the approaching dune to today's position in the 1730s. Incorporated into the Prussian Province of East Prussia in 1773, it became part of the German Empire upon the German unification of 1871. In 1874 a lighthouse on Urbas hill was built, later destroyed in the war and rebuilt in 1945 and 1953. Artists' colony Corinth: Churchyard in Nidden (1893) Thomas Mann's summer house From the late 19th century, the dune landscape became popular with landscape and animal painters from the Kunstakademie K√∂nigsberg arts school. The local inn of Herman Blode was the nucleus of the expressionist artists' colony (K√ºnstlerkolonie Nidden). Lovis Corinth sojourned there, as did Max Pechstein, Alfred Lichtwark, Karl Schmidt- Rottluff, and Alfred Partikel.Weise, p. 159 Painters from K√∂nigsberg such as Julius Freymuth and Eduard Bischoff visited the area, as did poets such as Ernst Wiechert and Carl Zuckmayer. Other guests included Ernst Kirchner, Ernst Mollenhauer, Franz Domscheit, and Herrmann Wirth. The painters usually took accommodations at Blode's hotel, and left some of their works with him. Some also built their own residences in the vicinity. After World War I Nidden, together with the northern half of the Curonian Spit (Kurische Nehrung), became part of the Klaipƒóda Region (Memelland) under terms of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles and was annexed by Lithuania in 1923. Officially renamed Nida, the village nevertheless remained a predominantly German settlement; the border with the remaining German (East Prussian) half of the spit lay only a few kilometers to the south. In 1929 Nobel Prize-winning writer Thomas Mann visited Nida while on holiday in nearby Rauschen and decided to have a summer house erected on a hill above the lagoon; it was mocked by locals as Uncle Tom's Cabin (Onkel Toms H√ºtte). He and his family spent the summers of 1930-32 in the cottage, and parts of the epic novel Joseph and His Brothers (Joseph und seine Br√ºder) were written there. Threatened by the Nazis due to his political views, Mann left Germany after Hitler's Machtergreifung in 1933 and eventually emigrated to the United States. After the Klaipƒóda Region was again annexed by (now Nazified) Germany in 1939, his house was seized at the behest of Hermann G√∂ring and designated a recreation home for Luftwaffe officers. Post-war In 1939 the town had 736 inhabitants. Nida became nearly uninhabited, like all of the Curonian Spit, as a result of the Red Army advance and the Evacuation of East Prussia at the end of World War II, and the eventual expulsion of surviving German inhabitants. The town was reassigned to Lithuania under border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference, and became part of the Lithuanian SSR within the Soviet Union; since 1990 it has been part of independent Lithuania. In the early postwar period, Nida was a little-visited fishing village. Later in Soviet times Nida, together with three other villages of the Neringa Municipality (Juodkrantƒó, Preila and Pervalka), was a controlled-entry holiday region reserved for the Communist party officialdom (nomenklatura) and senior industry elite. Strict planning regulations, a ban on industrial development and generous municipal subsidies kept it unspoiled. Since independence, the area has been open to all, but the number of visitors is kept relatively low by the small number of hotel rooms (new developments usually are permitted only on old buildings' foundations) and comparatively high rents. Mann's summer cottage survived the war and was preserved on the initiative of the Lithuanian poet Antanas Venclova. A first memorial site was inaugurated already in 1967. In the Soviet era it hosted a library open in summer only, with residential quarters of the visiting librarian posted from Klaipƒóda upstairs and public areas downstairs. In 1995/96 the house was restored according to the original architectural design and reopenend as a cultural center dedicated to the writer, with a memorial exhibition and an annual festival. Climate Tourism Skruzdynƒós Street, Nida (2013) Fisherman's Ethnographic Homestead The town is an upmarket holiday resort, hosting about 200,000 to 300,000 tourists each summer, mostly Lithuanians, Germans, Latvians, and Russians. It is characterized by low-key entertainment and a distinct family focus. However, during recent years it has become a decent point of interest for fine electronica music and modern art shows at an eclectic forest retreat. Since 2001, a jazz festival has been held every year. A local radio station Neringa FM streams live beats over FM and online. There are also interesting places to see nearby, including some of the highest sand dunes in Europe, a large sundial (which has been restored after being damaged by a Baltic gale), Fisherman's Ethnographic Homestead, gallery- museum of amber and a German Protestant (Evangelische) Brick Gothic church (built in 1888). There is also a campsite. The town is known for Nidden Kurenwimpel ‚Äî German for \\"Curonian pennants\\" ‚Äî ornate carved flags particular to local families resident on the Curonian Spit. The flags, replicas of which can be seen around Nida, feature animal and human figures as pictograms reminiscent of a pagan writing tradition. At the local cemetery, examples of krik≈°tas (pl. krik≈°tai), pagan burial markers in place of tombstones, can still be seen. Nida's beach participates in the Blue Flag Programme. Nudists make use of parts of the beach near Nida for nude bathing. Transportation Nida Airport is located in the town, but it has no scheduled routes and only capable of handling small aircraft. Nida also has a seaport which is used for ferries and fishing boats. The only road which runs along the whole length of the Curonian Spit, connecting Zelenogradsk and Smiltynƒó (where a ferry connection to Klaipƒóda exists), passes through the edge of Nida.

Jugurtha was the nephew and adopted son of Micipsa, King of Numidia, whom he succeeded on the throne, overcoming his rivals through assassination, war, and bribery. The war constituted an important phase in the Roman subjugation of Northern Africa, but Numidia did not become a Roman province until 46 BC. Following Jugurtha's usurpation of the throne of Numidia,Sallust, The Jugurthine War, XII a loyal ally of Rome since the Punic Wars,Matyszak, The Enemies of Rome, p. 64 Rome felt compelled to intervene. Jugurtha and Numidia Numidia was a kingdom located in North Africa (roughly corresponding to northern modern day Algeria) adjacent to what had been Rome's arch enemy, Carthage. King Masinissa, who was a steadfast ally of Rome in the Third Punic War, died in 149, and was succeeded by his son Micipsa, who ruled 149-118 BC. At the time of his death Micipsa had three potential heirs, his two sons, Adherbal and Hiempsal I, and an illegitimate nephew, Jugurtha. Jugurtha had fought under Scipio Aemilianus at the siege of Numantia, where, through friendship with Roman aristocrats, he had formed an acquaintance with Roman manners and military tactics. Micipsa, worried that at his death Jugurtha would usurp the kingdom from his own somewhat less able sons, adopted him, and bequeathed the kingship jointly to his two sons and Jugurtha.J. A. Froude, Caesar- A Sketch, (A. L. Burt Company, New York, 1903), ch. IV, pp. 33, 34 After King Micipsa's death the three kings fell out, and ultimately agreed between themselves to divide their inheritance into three separate kingdoms;T. Mommsen, The History of Rome, (The Colonial Press, Massachusetts, 1958), ch. III, p. 94 however, they were unable to agree on the terms of division, and Jugurtha declared open war on his cousins; Hiempsal, who, though the younger, was the braver of the brothers, was assassinated by Jugurtha's agents, and Adherbal, unable to defend himself, was defeated and forced to flee to Rome, where he appealed for arbitration to the Roman Senate.Mommsen, p. 95 Although the Senate were securities for Micipsa's will, they now allowed themselves to be bribed by Jugurtha into overlooking his crimes, and organized a commission, led by the ex-Consul Lucius Opimius, to fairly divide Numidia between the remaining contestants (116 BC). However, Jugurtha bribed the Roman officials in the commission into allotting him the better, more fertile and populous western half of Numidia, while Adherbal received the east.Mommsen, p. 96 Powerless against Roman corruption, Adherbal accepted and peace was made. Shortly after, in 113 BC, Jugurtha again declared war on his brother, and defeated him, forcing him to retreat into Cirta, Adherbal's capital. Adherbal held out for some months, aided by a large number of Roman Equites who had settled in Africa for commercial purposes. From inside his siege lines, Adherbal appealed again to Rome, and the Senate dispatched a message to Jugurtha to desist. The latter ignored the demand, and the Senate sent a second commission, this time headed by Marcus Scaurus, a respected member of the aristocracy, to threaten the Numidian king into submission. The king, pretending to be open to discussion, protracted negotiations with Scaurus long enough for Cirta to run out of provisions and hope of relief. When Scaurus left without having forced Jugurtha to a commitment, Adherbal surrendered. Jugurtha promptly had him executed, along with the Romans who had joined in the defence of Cirta.Mommsen, p. 97 But the deaths of Roman citizens caused an immediate furore among the commoners at home, and the Senate, threatened by the popular tribune Gaius Memmius, finally declared war on Jugurtha in 111 BC., though with reluctance.Mommsen, p. 98The Encyclopedia of World History, (Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, 1952), ch. II, p. 92 Numidia between 112 and 105 B.C. and main battles of the war. Bestia Lucius Calpurnius Bestia, consul for the year, was appointed to command the Roman army in Africa against Jugurtha; he was accompanied by Scaurus and other experienced officers and received an offer of alliance from Bocchus, king of Mauretania. The defection of Bocchus, his own father-in-law, filled Jugurtha with alarm, and he sent to the Roman consul to surrender.Mommsen, ibid Whereupon the Roman senators, no longer looking on him as a threat, allowed themselves to be bribed into granting him a treaty on extremely lenient terms; Numidia was restored to Jugurtha intact, and a small fine and the remittal of his war-elephants (which he later bought back at reduced price from corrupt officers), was the only price he was forced to pay for his crimes.Mommsen, p. 99 In fact, so favourable were Jugurtha's terms of surrender that it led to a renewal of the popular outcry at Rome; at the demand of the Tribune Memmius, an investigation was launched into the proceedings of the treaty. Jugurtha was summoned to Rome ‚Äì with the promise of a safe-conduct ‚Äì and appeared as a witness; but, rather than complying with the inquisition, bribed two Roman Tribunes to veto the proceedings and prevent him from testifying. In the ensuing outrage, Jugurtha's cousin Massiva, who had fled to Rome in fear of his cousin, seized the opportunity to press his own claim to the Numidian throne. Jugurtha assassinated him, and the Senate, though initially inclined to accept bribery again to allow him to escape retribution,Froude, p. 35 was ultimately compelled by his insolence and by the fury of the mob to expel him from the city and revoke the recent peace.Mommsen, p. 100 Spurius, Aulus Postumius The consul Spurius Postumius Albinus took command of the Roman army in Africa (110 BC), but failed to carry out energetic action, due to incompetence, indiscipline in his army, and ‚Äì it was alleged ‚Äì bribery by Jugurtha. Later in the year Albinus returned to Italy, leaving the command to his brother, Aulus Postumius Albinus Magnus. The latter, more active though no more able than his brother, decided on a bold stroke, marching in mid-winter to besiege the town of Suthul, where the Numidian treasury was kept; however, the town was strongly garrisoned and excellently fortified and could not be captured. Postumius, anxious not to have retreated without striking the enemy a blow, allowed Jugurtha to lure him into the desolate wilds of the Sahara, where the cunning Numidian king, who had reportedly bribed Roman officers to facilitate his attack, was able to catch the Romans at a disadvantage. Half the Roman army were killed, and the survivors were forced to pass under the yoke in a disgraceful symbolism of surrender.Froude, p. 36 The beaten Postumius signed a treaty resigning Numidia to Jugurtha and returning to the peace concluded with Bestia and Scaurus. The Roman Senate, however, when it heard of this capitulation, refused to honour the conditions and continued the war.Mommsen, Ibid Metellus After Postumius' defeat, the Senate finally shook itself from its lethargy, appointing as commander in Africa the plebeian noble Quintus Metellus, who had a reputation for integrity and courage. Metellus proved the soundness of his judgement by selecting as officers for the campaign men of ability rather than of rank, as the former tribune Gaius Marius (a plebeian from Arpinum) and the noted disciplinarian and military theorist Publius Rutilius Rufus.Mommsen, p. 102 When Metellus arrived in Africa in 109 BC, he first had to retrain the army and institute some for of discipline.Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, p. 46; Eutropius, Epitome of Roman History, 4.27.Mommsen, ibid In spring of 109, Metellus led his reorganised army into Numidia; Jugurtha was alarmed and attempted negotiation, but Metellus prevaricated; and, without granting Jugurtha terms, he conspired with Jugurtha's envoys to capture Jugurtha and deliver him to the Romans. The crafty Jugurtha, guessing Metellus' intentions, broke up negotiation and retreated, withdrew south beyond the Numidian mountains and took up position on the plains behind.Mommsen, p. 103 Metellus followed and crossed the mountains into the desert, advancing to the river Muthul. Jugurtha had divided his army into two detachments, one of which (composed of cavalry and the best of his infantry) lay south of the mountain on the right flank of the Romans, who were marching to the river Muthul, which lay parallel to the mountains, 18 miles to the south; the second lay further south, closer to the river (formed of war-elephants and the rest of the infantry). Metellus handled the situation by sending one force directly south to the river under Rufus while the rest under Metellus and Marius marched obliquely south-west to dislodge Jugurtha from his position and prevent him from hindering the march of the first body to the river. Jugurtha, however, displaying excellent generalship, dispatched a column of infantry to hold the mountain passes as soon as the Romans had descended into the plain, thus cutting off their line of retreat; while his cavalry harried Metellus' detachment of infantry in swarms along the plain ‚Äì to which the Romans were unable to properly respond, since they had no cavalry themselves. Meanwhile, Rufus had advanced to the river but was attacked by Jugurtha's southern force; thus, the two Roman armies were incapable of coming to each other's relief. However, although Metellus' army was now entrapped in the desert with fewer troops and inferior generalship, the Romans still prevailed simultaneously on both fronts. Rufus overpowered the southern detachment by a forward charge, sending the elephants and infantry of the enemy flying across the desert; while Metellus and Marius, rallying a group of legionaries, charged to occupy the single hill on the plain, which commanded the situation. The inferior Numidian soldiers of Jugurtha were powerless before the advance of Roman infantry and scattered into the desert with severe losses. Metellus had won the Battle of the Muthul, but since the Numidian king had escaped the war was far from over.Mommsen, p. 104 After this defeat a fresh round of negotiations ensued between Jugurtha and the Roman commander. Although Jugurtha offered heavy concessions, they were ultimately unsuccessful because Metellus believed the war could only end with the capture of Jugurtha, who refused to become a prisoner.Mommsen, p. 105 To resist the Romans more effectually, Jugurtha dismissed most of his low-quality recruits, keeping only the most active troops of infantry and light cavalry, in order to maintain the war by guerrilla tactics. Metellus advanced once again, capturing town after town, but was unable to capture his enemy. He tried to provoke Jugurtha into a pitched battle by besieging the Numidian city of Zama, but the king refused to let himself be goaded and kept up his irregular warfare tactics.Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, pp 52‚Äì54. In 108 BC, Metellus found out the location of Jugurtha's army, he caught up with the Numidians and inflicted a serious defeated on the king.Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, p. 75. Jugurtha, with his family and treasure boxes, fled to the desert fortress of Thala, which was inaccessible except by an excruciating march of three days through the desert without water. Metellus furnished his army with skins for water transport and followed to besiege the fortress, which fell after forty days. However, Jugurtha managed to escape from the flaming wreckage, undoing all of Metellus' efforts.Mommsen, p. 106 At this point Jugurtha retired to the court of his father-in-law, king Bocchus I of Mauretania, who though previously professing friendship for the Romans, now received Jugurtha hospitably, and, without positively declaring war (on Rome), advanced with his troops into Numidia as far as Cirta, the capital. Metellus, who had taken up winter quarters in the area after the conclusion of the campaign, began negotiation with Bocchus to hand over Jugurtha. But before an agreement could be reached, Metellus was deposed from his command by the Roman Tribal Assembly and replaced by his lieutenant, Gaius Marius.Mommsen, p. 107 An internal struggle in the Roman camp between Metellus and Marius led to this change of command. Metellus looked unfavourably on Marius's known ambitions in Roman politics and refused for days to allow him to sail to Rome and stand for the consulship. Eventually, Metellus permitted Marius to return to Rome and Marius was elected consul in 107. Metellus was, however, unaware that Marius wanted his command in Numidia. Numidia was not an area designated to be assigned to a consul by the Roman Senate. However, the populares passed a law in its Tribal Assembly which gave the command against Jugurtha to Marius in 107. This was significant because the Assembly usurped the Senate's rights and powers in this matter and the Senate yielded.Mommsen, p. 108 Metellus was furious at all these developments and decided to make Marius's command a lot more difficult by refusing his legions to serve under Marius.Lynda Telford, Sulla, A Dictator Reconsidered, p.43 He [Metellus] sent them back to Italy to join the army of the other consul, Lucius Cassius Longinus, who was about to march north to confront a Germanic invasion of Gaul. Marius Marius found Rome's traditional manpower reserves depleted. As inequality increased, fewer men of military age met the property requirements to serve in the legions. Yet, thousands of poor Italians, the Capite Censi or Head Count, sat idly in Rome, ineligible to serve. Seeking to use them, and with precedent for waiving the property requirements during the existential crisis that was the Second Punic War, Marius was exempted from the requirements. These events would inspire Marius into reforming the Roman army.Lynda Telfort, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, P. 43 When Gaius Marius arrived in Numidia as consul in 107 BC he immediately ceased negotiation and resumed the war. Marius marched west plundering the Numidian countryside, seizing minor Numidian towns and fortresses trying to provoke Jugurtha into a set-piece battle, but the Numidian king refused to engage. Marius' strategy was similar to Metellus', and yielded no better results; he continued the occupation of Numidian towns and he fortified several strategic positions. At the end of 107 BC Marius made a dangerous desert march to Capsa in the far south where, after the town surrendered, he executed all survivors.Mommsen, p.108; Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, p. 81; Lynda Telford, Sulla, A Dictator Reconsidered, p.31. Next he advanced far to the west, capturing a fortress near the river Muluccha where Jugurtha had moved a large part of his treasure. Meanwhile, Jugurtha‚Äôs loyalists had recaptured Cirta.Lynda Telford, Sulla A Dictator Reconsidered, p.32 By marching so far to the west Marius had brought the Roman army very near to the dominions of king Bocchus finally provoking the Mauretanian into direct war; and, in the deserts just west of Serif, Marius was taken by surprise by a massive army of Numidians and Mauretanians under command of the two enemy kings. For once, Marius was unprepared for action and in the melee all he could do was form defensive circles. The attack was pressed by Gaetulian and Mauretanian cavalries and for a time Marius and his main force found themselves besieged on a hill, while Marius's quaestor Lucius Cornelius Sulla and his men were on the defensive on another hill nearby. However, the Romans managed to hold off the enemy until evening and the Africans retired confident of finishing the job the next morning. The Romans surprised the Africans' insufficiently guarded camp the next morning at dawn and completely routed the African army. They then marched east to take Cirta again and go into winter quarters there. The African kings harried the march east with light cavalry, but were beaten back by Sulla whom Marius had put in command of the rearguard and the cavalry. The combined African army then tried to finish off Marius, but when Sulla returned from his pursuit the Romans routed both Jugurtha‚Äôs and Bocchus‚Äôs army. Marius had won the Second Battle of Cirta and could now put his army into winter quarters.Mommsen, p. 109; Lynda Telford, Sulla, A Dictator Reconsidered, p.33 Marius's army thus finished the year's campaigns in safety at Cirta, but it was by now evident that Rome could not defeat Jugurtha's guerrilla tactics through war. Over the winter, therefore, Marius resumed negotiations with Bocchus, who, though he had joined in the fighting, had not yet declared war. Ultimately, Marius reached a deal with Bocchus whereby Sulla, who was friendly with members of Bocchus's court, would enter Bocchus's camp to receive Jugurtha as a hostage. In spite of the possibility of treachery on the Mauritanian's part, Sulla agreed; Jugurtha's remaining followers were treacherously massacred, and he himself handed over in chains to Sulla by Bocchus.Mommsen, p. 110 In the aftermath, Bocchus annexed the western part of Jugurtha's kingdom, and was made a friend of the Roman people. Jugurtha was thrown into an underground prison (the Tullianum) in Rome, and ultimately died after gracing Marius's triumph in 104 BC.Mommsen, pp. 110, 111 Revelations The Jugurthine War clearly revealed the problems of the Republic at that time. The fact that a man such as Jugurtha could rise to power by buying Roman military and civil officials reflected Rome's moral and ethical decline. Romans now sought individual power often at the expense of the state. This was illustrated by Marius's rise to power by ignoring Roman traditions. These events were also observed by Marius's quaestor, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who later came to rival Marius in the first of the great civil wars of the Late Republic. The beginning of this rivalry, according to Plutarch, was purportedly Sulla's crucial role in the negotiations for and eventual capture of Jugurtha, which led to Sulla wearing a ring portraying the capture despite Marius being awarded the victory for it. The Roman historian Sallust wrote a monograph, Bellum Jugurthinum, on the Jugurthine War emphasising this decline of Roman ethics and placed it, along with his work on the Conspiracy of Catiline, in the timeline of the degeneration of Rome that began with the Fall of Carthage and ended with the Fall of the Roman Republic itself. Sallust is one of the most valuable sources on the war, along with Plutarch's biographies of Sulla and Marius.

Post World War II, he was tried, found guilty and executed for his crimes, specifically the torture and murder of members of the Norwegian resistance movement.Patrick Bishop (2013) The Hunt for Hitler's Warship, p189. Simon & Schuster Background Flesch was an Oberregierungsrat and held the rank of SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer (lieutenant colonel). He was born in Posen, Province of Posen, German Empire. He became a member of NSDAP (Nazi Party) in 1933. In 1934, he obtained his law degree and by 1936 was a member of the Gestapo, when Reinhard Heydrich appointed him over a unit to control the religious sects of Germany. In 1938, he took part in the German march into the Sudetenland, and in 1939, in the annexation of Bohemia and Moravia. Later he was appointed political adviser to Gauleiter Fritz Sauckel in Thuringia. Career in World War II After the outbreak of the war in September, 1939, he became leader of an Einsatzkommando in Pozna≈Ñ (). Between 20 and 23 October 1939 the 14 Einsatzkommando that he commanded executed 275 Poles in the Greater Poland region near Poznan who were named as Polish patriots by Wolfgang Bickerich, the Lutheran pastor in Leszno, who had kept a list before the German invasion of Poland in 1939. They included political leaders, teachers, police officers, Catholic priests, workers, and farmers, and included scouts as young as 18. This was the start of Operation Tannenberg organized by Reinhard Heydrich which was meant to eliminate Polish leaders in the parts of Poland annexed to Germany:pl:Pierwsze masowe egzekucje w ramach operacji Tannenberg (Wielkopolska) In 1940, he joined the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf in their march into France. He had a position as Regierungsrat (Executive Council, government advisor), and was an SS- Sturmbannf√ºhrer (major) in April 1940, when he was assigned to Norway. His first job in Norway was Kommandeur der Sipo und des SD in Bergen (the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; Security Service) was primarily the intelligence service of the SS and the Nazi Party, where the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo; Security Police) was a term used in Nazi Germany to describe the state political and criminal investigation security agencies. It was made up by the combined forces of the Gestapo (secret state police) and the Kripo (criminal police) between 1936 and 1939. Thereafter, they became departments of the RSHA). On 11 October 1941, he was appointed Kommandeur der Sicherheitspolizei und des Sicherheitsdienst in Trondheim. As Kommandeur of the district, he was also chief of Falstad concentration camp outside Trondheim and the prisons in Trondheim. He was promoted to the rank of Obersturmbannf√ºhrer (lieutenant colonel) and received the title of Oberregierungsrat. His immediate superior was Heinrich Fehlis. On 8 May 1945, he fled from Trondheim with a gold bar in his luggage. He was caught and sent back with a police escort on the train and during which he made an unsuccessful attempt to escape. Paul Gerhardt Vigness (1970) The German Occupation of Norway pp.149,172. Vantage Press Trial and execution Flesch was known for being a notorious torturer, and ordered the execution of many members of the Norwegian resistance movement without any trial. After World War II, in 1946, he was tried for the many cases of torture and murder. He was charged with a series of war crimes committed in Norway; seven instances of killing prisoners (a total of 37 individuals) five instances of torture (versch√£rfte Vernehmung: \\"enhanced interrogation\\") and one instance of causing death by withholding medical treatment. The court found that in all but two instances these charges to be proven, and he was found guilty and sentenced to death by execution by firing squad. Flesch appealed to the Supreme Court of Norway on procedural grounds and that the sentence was too harsh; however on 12 February 1948 his appeal was rejected. The sentence was carried out at midnight at Kristiansten festning on 28 February 1948. Right before the order was given to fire, Flesch shouted loudly \\"Heil Hitler\\".

The , also known as the Dragon's Triangle and the Pacific Bermuda Triangle, is a region of the Pacific, south of Tokyo. The Devil's Sea is sometimes considered as a paranormal location, though the veracity of these claims has been questioned.  Description  A possible form of the Dragon's Triangle. Due to the Berlitz's claim having many inconsistencies, its exact form is unclear. The Japanese word ma no umi (translated as evil sea, troublesome sea, or dangerous sea) has been widely used to describe dangerous marine locations around the world.Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun has claimed the following areas as \\"ma- no umi\\" or \\"ma-no kaiiki\\" before 1954: Bay of Bengal (1914.07.26 morning), Kuril Islands (1924.05.31 evening), Korea Strait (1926.03.28 morning), Lake Baikal (1926.04.02 morning), Korsakov (town) (1930.05.04 morning), East coast of Japan (1930.07.19 evening), Hainan (1939.02.11 morning), Near the United Kingdom (1939.12.15 evening), Atlantic Ocean (1940.03.08 evening), and Taiwan Strait (1954.10.20 evening) This means that there are many locations that the Japanese call ma no umi. On 4 January 1955, Japanese ship Shinyo Maru No. 10 (Á¨¨ÂçÅ‰º∏Ê¥ã‰∏∏) lost radio contact near Mikura-jima. Japanese newspapers then began to label the location as ma no umi until the ship was found safe on 15 January.Asahi Shimbun 1955.01.12 morning Yomiuri Shimbun showed a map of the sea with points of several other ships that had been lost in recent years, and stated that those ships were lost within the area that the Yokohama Coast Guard Office had classified as a special danger area.Yomiuri Shimbun 1955.01.14 morningKushce: p. 257 In the U.S., The New York Times introduced this incident with the term \\"The Devil's Sea,\\" where nine ships had been lost in perfect weather.TOKYO GETS NEWS FROM MISSING SHIP; Faint Signal Ends Japanese Fears for Vessel's Fate  All Aboard Are Safe - The New York TimesKusche 1975, p. 253 Yomiuri Shimbun described the size of the ma no umi as follows: \\"From the Izu islands to east of the Ogasawara islands; about 200 miles east to west, and about 300 miles north to south, where nine ships were lost in the past five years\\". However, two of the nine ships were lost near Miyake-jima and Iwo Jima, about 750 miles apart.Kusche 1975, p. 258 In 1974, American paranormal writer Charles Berlitz introduced the Devil's Sea in his book The Bermuda Triangle. Berlitz claimed that \\"nine modern ships and several hundred crews were lost without traces between 1950 and 1954; in 1955, the Japanese government sent Kaiyo Maru No 5 to the sea for investigating unexplained ship losses, but this ship vanished as wellBerlitz 1974, p. 92 After the incident, Japanese authorities have labeled the sea as a danger zone.Berlitz 1974, p. 91 In 1989, Berlitz claimed that the Devil's Sea is also called the Dragon's Triangle in his book The Dragon's Triangle.Berlitz 1989, p. 15 Berlitz continued by theorizing that five Japanese military vessels disappeared while on maneuvers near Japanese shores in early 1942.Berlitz 1989, p. 24  Criticisms  Yomiuri Shimbun described that this blue quadrangle was the ma-no umi where the coast guard classified as special danger area. The actual danger area was the red circle according to Kusche. In 1975, American author, at that time librarian Larry Kusche published The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved, debunking the Devil's Sea legend. Kusche sent letters to government offices which were related to the sea, but nobody knew about the Devil's Sea or such a danger area.Kushce 1975, pp. 254‚Äì255 The actual danger zone where the Maritime Safety Agency of Japan warned not to approach was only 10 miles to My≈çjin-sh≈ç.Kusche 1975, p. 260 The Kaiyo Maru No. 5 was sent to My≈çjin-sh≈ç for investigating activity of an undersea volcano, and lost in 1952.Kushce 1975, p. 252 The loss of the Kaiyo Maru was accounted: undersea volcano eruption. One of eight other lost ships also was accounted. Most of the nine ships were small fishing boats with poor or no radio. The weather was not perfect.Kusche 1975, pp. 258‚Äì259 In 1995, Kusche's research claimed that Berlitz's military vessels were actually fishing vessels, and some of those listed by Berlitz sank outside the area defined by the Dragon's Triangle. Kusche also wrote that the Japanese research vessel carried not 100 personnel, but only 31 and that an undersea volcano destroyed it on 24 September 1952. In Daniel Cohen's 1974 book Curses, Hexes & Spells, it's reported that legends of the danger of the Dragon's Triangle go back for centuries in Japan. Its most famous casualty was the No. 5 Kaiy≈ç-Maru, a scientific research vessel, which disappeared with the loss of all hands on 24 September 1952. With such a dramatic history, one would expect there to be all sorts of information on the subject, especially in Japan. A search completed by Skeptoid author Brian Dunning for books, newspaper, and magazine articles on the Dragon's Triangle came up completely empty, until a full 20 years after the loss of the Kaiy≈ç-Maru. Apparently, the story (even the very existence of this legendary named region) was not invented until very recently. Research also explores natural environmental changes, as the cause of such controversial anomalies in the Dragon's Triangle. One of these explanations is the vast field of methane hydrates present on the bottom of the ocean in the Dragon's Triangle area. Methane clathrates (methane hydrates gas) will \\"explode\\" when it rises above 18 ¬∞C (64 ¬∞F). Methane hydrate gases are described as icelike deposits that break off from the bottom and rise, forming bubbles on the surface of the water. These gas eruptions can interrupt buoyancy and can easily sink a ship, leaving no trace of debris. Another explanation for this \\"paranormal\\" activity could be the undersea volcanoes that are very common in this area. It is quite characteristic for small islands in the Dragon's Triangle to frequently disappear and new islands appear due to both volcanoes and seismic activity. Because the location of the Dragon's Triangle is not plotted on any official world map, the size and perimeter vary from one author to another author. In popular culture *The 2013 video game Tomb Raider is set on an island in the \\"Dragon's Triangle\\", which contains numerous wrecked ships and planes. *It is revealed in the final book of The Unwanteds, a fantasy book series written by Lisa McMann, that the seven islands traversed throughout the series are located within The Dragon's Triangle.

It measures about 100 kilometers in diameter (120 km along its major axis). It was discovered in 1852 by Hermann Goldschmidt, and is named after Lutetia, the Latin name of Paris. Lutetia has an irregular shape and is heavily cratered, with the largest impact crater reaching 45 km in diameter. The surface is geologically heterogeneous and is intersected by a system of grooves and scarps, which are thought to be fractures. It has a high average density, meaning that it is made of metal- rich rock. The Rosetta probe passed within of Lutetia in July 2010. It was the largest asteroid visited by a spacecraft until Dawn arrived at Vesta in July 2011. Discovery and exploration Animation of Rosetta trajectory from 2 March 2004 to 9 September 2016 Lutetia was discovered on 15 November 1852, by Hermann Goldschmidt from the balcony of his apartment in Paris. A preliminary orbit for the asteroid was computed in November‚ÄìDecember 1852 by German astronomer Georg R√ºmker and others. In 1903, it was photographed at opposition by Edward Pickering at Harvard College Observatory. He computed an opposition magnitude of 10.8. There have been two reported stellar occultations by Lutetia, observed from Malta in 1997 and Australia in 2003, with only one chord each, roughly agreeing with IRAS measurements. On 10 July 2010, the European Rosetta space probe flew by Lutetia at a minimum distance of km at a velocity of 15 kilometres per second on its way to the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The flyby provided images of up to 60 meters per pixel resolution and covered about 50% of the surface, mostly in the northern hemisphere. The 462 images were obtained in 21 narrow- and broad-band filters extending from 0.24 to 1 Œºm. Lutetia was also observed by the visible‚Äìnear-infrared imaging spectrometer VIRTIS, and measurements of the magnetic field and plasma environment were taken as well. Characteristics Orbit Lutetia orbits the Sun at the distance of approximately 2.4 AU in the inner asteroid belt. Its orbit lies almost in the plane of ecliptic and is moderately eccentric. The orbital period of Lutetia is 3.8 years. Mass and density The Rosetta flyby demonstrated that the mass of Lutetia is (1.700 ¬± 0.017) kg, smaller than the pre-flyby estimate of 2.57 kg. It has one of the highest densities seen in asteroids at 3.4 ¬± 0.3 g/cm3. Taking into account possible porosity of 10‚Äì15%, the bulk density of Lutetia exceeds that of a typical stony meteorite. Composition The composition of Lutetia has puzzled astronomers for some time. While classified among the M-type asteroids, most of which are metallic, Lutetia is one of the anomalous members that do not display much evidence of metal on their surface. Indeed, there were various indications of a non- metallic surface: a flat, low frequency spectrum similar to that of carbonaceous chondrites and C-type asteroids and not at all like that of metallic meteorites, a low radar albedo unlike the high albedos of strongly metallic asteroids like 16 Psyche, evidence of hydrated materials on its surface, abundant silicates, and a thicker regolith than most asteroids. The Rosetta probe actually found that the asteroid has a moderately red spectrum in the visible light and essentially flat spectrum in the near infrared. No absorption features were detected in the range covered by observations, 0.4‚Äì3.5 Œºm. Thus previous reports of hydrated minerals and organic compounds on the surface of Lutetia have been disproven. The surface also does not contain any olivine. Together with the high density of Lutetia these results indicate that it is either made of the enstatite chondrite material or may be related to metal-rich and water-poor carbonaceous chondrite of classes like CB, CH, or CR. Rosetta observations revealed that the surface of Lutetia is covered with a regolith made of loosely aggregated dust particles 50‚Äì100 Œºm in size. It is estimated to be 3 km thick and may be responsible for the softened outlines of many of the larger craters. Shape and axial tilt 21 Lutetia's orbit, and its position on 1 Jan 2009 (NASA Orbit Viewer applet). The Rosetta probe's photographs confirmed the results of a 2003 lightcurve analysis that described Lutetia as a rough sphere with \\"sharp and irregular shape features\\". A study from 2004‚Äì2009 proposed that Lutetia has a non-convex shape, likely because of a large crater, Suspicio Crater. It is not yet clear whether Rosetta's findings support this claim. The analysis of Rosetta images in combination with photometric light curves yielded the position of the north rotational pole of Lutetia: , . This gives an axial tilt of 96¬∞ (retrograde rotator), meaning that the axis of rotation is approximately parallel to the ecliptic, similar to the planet Uranus. Surface features and nomenclature Surface features The surface of Lutetia is covered by numerous impact craters and intersected by fractures, scarps and grooves thought to be surface manifestations of internal fractures. On the imaged hemisphere of the asteroid there are a total of 350 craters with diameters ranging from 600 m to 55 km. The most heavily cratered surfaces (in Achaia region) have a crater retention age of about 3.6 ¬± 0.1 billion years. The surface of Lutetia has been divided into seven regions based on their geology. They are Baetica (Bt), Achaia (AC), Etruria (Et), Narbonensis (Nb), Noricum (Nr), Pannonia (Pa), and Raetia (Ra). The Baetica region is situated around the north pole (in the center of the image) and includes a cluster of impact craters 21 km in diameter as well as their impact deposits. It is the youngest surface unit on Lutetia. Baetica is covered by a smooth ejecta blanket approximately 600 m thick that has partially buried older craters. Other surface features include landslides, gravitational taluses and ejecta blocks up to 300 m in size. The landslides and corresponding rock outcrops are correlated with variations of albedo, being generally brighter. The two oldest regions are Achaia and Noricum. The former is a remarkably flat area with a lot of impact craters. The Narbonensis region coincides with the largest impact crater on Lutetia‚ÄîMassilia. It includes a number of smaller units and is modified by pit chains and grooves formed at a later epoch. Other two regions‚ÄîPannonia and Raetia are also likely to be large impact craters. The last Noricum region is intersected by a prominent groove 10 km in length and about 100 m deep. The numerical simulations showed that even the impact that produced the largest crater on Lutetia, which is 45 km in diameter, seriously fractured but did not shatter the asteroid. So, Lutetia has likely survived intact from the beginning of the Solar System. The existence of linear fractures and the impact crater morphology also indicate that the interior of this asteroid has a considerable strength and is not a rubble pile like many smaller asteroids. Taken together, these facts suggest that Lutetia should be classified as a primordial planetesimal. Suspicio Crater Studies of patterns of fractures on Lutetia lead astronomers to think that there is a ~45 kilometer impact crater on the southern side of Lutetia, named Suspicio Crater, but because Rosetta only observed Lutetia's northern part, it is not known for certain what it looks like, or if it exists at all. Nomenclature In March, 2011, the Working Group for Planetary Nomenclature at the International Astronomical Union agreed on a naming scheme for geographical features on Lutetia. Since Lutetia was a Roman city, the asteroid's craters are named after cities of the Roman Empire and the adjacent parts of Europe during the time of Lutetia's existence. Its regions are named after the discoverer of Lutetia (Goldschmidt) and after provinces of the Roman Empire at the time of Lutetia. Other features are named after rivers of the Roman Empire and the adjacent parts of Europe at the time of the city. Origin This animation is an artist's impression of a possible scenario to explain how Lutetia came to now be located in the asteroid belt. The composition of Lutetia suggests that it formed in the inner Solar System, among the terrestrial planets, and was ejected into the asteroid belt through an interaction with one of them.Battered asteroid Lutetia a rare relic of Earth's birth Space.com See also *List of geological features on 21 Lutetia References External links * Rosetta snaps views of asteroid Lutetia * Rosetta's full resolution images of Lutetia * Parent article of image by Planetary Society  Category:Background asteroids Lutetia Lutetia Lutetia Lutetia 20100710 Category:Articles containing video clips Category:M-type asteroids (Tholen) Category:Xk-type asteroids (SMASS) 18521115 ","title":"21 Lutetia"},{"id":"558473","text":"Beni ·∏§assan ( \\"Children of ·∏§assƒÅn\\") is a nomadic group of Arabian origin, one of the four sub-tribes of the Maqil Arab tribes who emigrated in the 11th century to the Maghreb with the Bani Hilal and Banu Sulaym tribes.Ahmed Anna√ß√©ri's Handwritten \\"Tala√†t Al Mouchtari\\" (died in 1717) In Morocco, they first settled, alongside their Maqil relatives, in the area between Tadla and the Moulouya River.

Life James Hoban was an Irish Catholic raised on an estate belonging to the Earl of Desart in Callan, County Kilkenny. He worked there as a wheelwright and carpenter until his early twenties, when he was given an 'advanced student' place in the Dublin Society's Drawing School on Lower Grafton Street. He studied under Thomas Ivory. He excelled in his studies and received the prestigious Duke of Leinster's medal for drawings of \\"Brackets, Stairs, and Roofs\\" from the Dublin Society in 1780. Hoban was an apprentice to Ivory, from 1779 to 1785. Following the American Revolutionary War, Hoban emigrated to the United States, and established himself as an architect in Philadelphia in 1785.Frary, page 27 Charleston County Courthouse, Charleston, SC (1790-92), James Hoban, architect.

Invoice dated March 27, 1802 for Sunday painting at Balustrades & Portico of the Octagon is signed by James Hoban. Hoban was in South Carolina by April 1787, where he designed numerous buildings including the Charleston County Courthouse (1790‚Äì92), built on the ruins of the former South Carolina Statehouse (1753, burned 1788).History of the Charleston County Courthouse from HMdb.org President George Washington admired Hoban's work on his Southern Tour, Washington may have met with him in Charleston in May 1791, and summoned the architect to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the temporary national capital) in June 1792.William Seale, \\"James Hoban: Builder of the White House\\" in White House History no. 22 (Spring 2008), pp. 8-12. In July 1792, Hoban was named winner of the design competition for the White House.Bryan, page 194‚Äì195. His initial design seems to have had a 3-story facade, nine bays across (like the Charleston courthouse). Under Washington's influence, Hoban amended this to a 2-story facade, 11 bays across, and, at Washington's insistence, the whole presidential mansion was faced with stone. It is unclear whether any of Hoban's surviving drawings are actually from the competition.Commissioners of the District of Columbia, Record Group 42, National Archives, cited in Seale, pp. 10-16. It is known that Hoban owned at least three slaves who were employed as carpenters in the construction of the White House. Their names are recorded as \\"Ben, Daniel, and Peter\\" and appear in a James Hoban slave payroll.https://www.whitehousehistory.org/photos/photo-2-4 Hoban was also one of the supervising architects who served on the Capitol, carrying out the design of Dr. William Thornton, as well as with The Octagon House. Hoban lived the rest of his life in Washington, D.C., where he worked on other public buildings and government projects, including roads and bridges.Frary, page 28. Local folklore has it that Hoban designed Rossenarra House near the village of Kilmoganny in County Kilkenny, Ireland in 1824. Hoban's wife Susanna Sewall was the daughter of the prominent Georgetown \\"City Tavern\\" proprietor. After the District of Columbia was granted limited home rule in 1802, Hoban served on the twelve-member city council for most of the remainder of his life, except during the years he was rebuilding the White House.James Hoban, Architect of the White House: Civic Contributions and Family, White House Historical Association Hoban was also involved in the development of Catholic institutions in the city, including Georgetown University (where his son was a member of the Jesuit community), St. Patrick's Parish, and the Georgetown Visitation Monastery founded by another Kilkenny native, Teresa Lalor of Ballyragget. Hoban died in Washington, D.C., on December 8, 1831. He was originally buried at Holmead's Burying Ground, but was disinterred and reburied at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Washington, D.C. His son James Hoban, Jr., said to be the spitting image of his father, served as district attorney of the District of Columbia.

Born in Falkirk, the son of John Young and Agnes Renny, Young was first elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in 1836 as a Reformer (or Liberal) and, as a lawyer, defended Reform journalists accused of libel. When responsible government was instituted in 1848, Young hoped to become the first Premier but was passed over in favour of fellow reformer James Boyle Uniacke and Young became Speaker. However, Young succeeded Uniacke in 1854. His government was accused of overlooking Catholics and tensions with Catholics were exacerbated by Joseph Howe's rupture with Nova Scotia's Irish Catholic community over his recruitment of Americans to fight on the British side in the Crimean War. In February 1857, ten Catholic and two Protestant Liberals voted with the Tories to bring down Young's government. Young returned to power in January 1860 when the Tory government was unable to command a majority in the legislature after an election. In July, the colony's Chief Justice died and Young, who had long coveted the job, was appointed to the position by the lieutenant governor. He served as Chief Justice for twenty-one years and was noted for placing cushions on his chair so he would tower above his fellow justices. He died in Halifax in 1887.

Institutional development The term 'medieval studies' began to be adopted by academics in the opening decades of the twentieth century, initially in the titles of books like G. G. Coulton's Ten Medieval Studies (1906), to emphasize a greater interdisciplinary approach to a historical subject. In American and European universities the term provided a coherent identity to centres composed of academics from a variety of disciplines including archaeology, art history, architecture, history, literature and linguistics. The Institute of Mediaeval Studies at St. Michael's College of the University of Toronto became the first centre of this type in 1929;H. Damico, J. B. Zavadil, D. Fennema, and K. Lenz, Medieval Scholarship: Philosophy and the arts: biographical studies on the formation of a discipline (Taylor & Francis, 1995), p. 80. it is now the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies (PIMS) and is part of the University of Toronto. It was soon followed by the Medieval Institute at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, which was founded in 1946 but whose roots go back to the establishment of a Program of Medieval Studies in 1933.MI History, University of Notre Dame As with many of the early programs at Roman Catholic institutions, it drew its strengths from the revival of medieval scholastic philosophy by such scholars as √âtienne Gilson and Jacques Maritain, both of whom made regular visits to the university in the 1930s and 1940s. These institutions were preceded in the United Kingdom, in 1927, by the establishment of the idiosyncratic Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, at Cambridge University. Although Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic was limited geographically (to the British Isles and Scandinavia) and chronologically (mostly the early Middle Ages), it promoted the interdisciplinarity characteristic of Medieval Studies and many of its graduates were involved in the later development of Medieval Studies programmes elsewhere in the UK.Michael Lapidge, 'Introduction: The Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge, 1878-1999', in H. M. Chadwick and the Study of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic in Cambridge, ed. by Michael Lapidge (Aberystwyth: Department of Welsh, Aberystwyth University, 2015), , pp. 1-58 [=Cambrian Medieval Celtic Studies, 69/70 (2015)]. With university expansion in the late 1960s and early 1970s encouraging interdisciplinary cooperation, similar centres were established in England at University of Reading (1965), at University of Leeds (1967) and the University of York (1968), and in the United States at Fordham University (1971).G. McMullan and D. Matthews, Reading the medieval in early modern England (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 231. A more recent wave of foundations, perhaps helped by the rise of interest in things medieval associated with neo- medievalism, include centres at King's College London (1988), the University of Bristol (1994), the University of Sydney (1997)D. Metzger and L. J. Workman, Medievalism and the academy II: cultural studies (Boydell & Brewer, 2000), p. 18. and Bangor University (2005). Medieval studies is buoyed by a number of annual international conferences which bring together thousands of professional medievalists, including the International Congress on Medieval Studies, at Kalamazoo MI, U.S., and the International Medieval Congress at the University of Leeds.W. D. Padenm The Future of the Middle Ages: medieval literature in the 1990s (University Press of Florida, 1994), p. 23. There are a number of journals devoted to medieval studies, including: Mediaevalia, Comitatus, Viator, Traditio, Medieval Worlds, Journal of Medieval History, Journal of Medieval Military History, and Speculum, an organ of the Medieval Academy of America founded in 1925 and based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.A. Molho, and G. S. Wood, Imagined histories: American historians interpret the past (Princeton University Press, 1998), p. 238. Another part of the infrastructure of the field is the International Medieval Bibliography. Historiographical development The term 'Middle Ages' first began to be common in English-language history-writing in the early nineteenth century. Henry Hallam's 1818 View of the State of Europe during the Middle Ages has been seen as a key stage in the promotion of the term, along with Ruskin's 1853 Lectures on Architecture.Robert I. Moore, 'A Global Middle Ages?', in _The Prospect of Global History_ , ed. by James Belich, John Darwin, Margret Frenz, and Chris Wickham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), pp. 80-92 (pp. 82-83).\\"medieval, adj. and n.\\", \\"middle age, n. and adj.\\" Accessed 5 August 2018.

Accessed 5 August 2018. European study of the medieval past was characterised in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by romantic nationalism, as emergent nation- states sought to legitimise new political formations by claiming that they were rooted in the distant past.Ian Wood, 'Literary Composition and the Early Medieval Historian in the Nineteenth Century', in The Making of Medieval History, ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), , pp. 37-53. The most important example of this use of the Middle Ages was the nation-building that surrounded the unification of Germany.Bastian Schl√ºter, 'Barbarossa's Heirs: nation and Medieval History in Nineteenth-cand Twentieth-Century Germany', in The Making of Medieval History, ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), , pp. 87-100.Bernhard Jussen, 'Between Ideology and Technology: Depicting Charlemagne in Modern Times', in The Making of Medieval History, ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), , pp. 127-52.Christian L√ºbke, 'Germany's Growth to the East: From the Polabian Marches to Germania Slavica', in The Making of Medieval History, ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), , pp. 167-83. Narratives which presented European countries as becoming modern by building on, yet also developing beyond, their medieval heritage, were also important in legitimating European colonialism elsewhere in the world, by suggesting that colonised regions had not developed in this way. The most prominent example of this aspect of medieval studies is imperial Britain and its former colonies in the Americas. Both nationalist and colonialist entanglements meant that the study of the Middle Ages in this period had a role in the emergence of white supremacism.Allen J. Frantzen, _Desire for Origins: New Language, Old English, and Teaching the Tradition_ (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1990).John M. Ganim, _Medievalism and Orientalism: Three Essays on Literature, Architecture and Cultural Identity_ (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005). However, the early twentieth century also saw new approaches associated with the rise of social sciences such as economic history and anthropology, epitomised by the influential Annales School. In place of what the Annalistes called histoire √©v√©nementielle, this work favoured study of large questions over long periods.Graham A. Loud and Martial Staub, 'Some Thoughts on the Making of the Middle Ages', in The Making of Medieval History, ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), , pp. 1-13. In the wake of the Second World War, the complicity of medievalism in Europe's competitive nationalism led to greatly diminished enthusiasm for medieval studies within the academy‚Äîthough nationalist deployments of the Middle Ages still existed and remained powerful.Patrick Geary, 'European Ethnicities and European as an Ethnicity: Does Europe Have too Much History?', in The Making of Medieval History, ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), , pp. 57-69. The proportion of medievalists in history and language departments fell,Robert I. Moore, 'A Global Middle Ages?', in _The Prospect of Global History_ , ed. by James Belich, John Darwin, Margret Frenz, and Chris Wickham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), pp. 80-92 (pp. 83-84). encouraging staff to collaborate across different departments; state funding of and university support for archaeology expanded, bringing new evidence but also new methods, disciplinary perspectives, and research questions forward; and the appeal of interdisciplinarity grew. Accordingly, medieval studies turned increasingly away from producing national histories, towards more complex mosaics of regional approaches that worked towards a European scope, partly correlating with post-War Europeanisation. An example from the apogee of this process was the large European Science Foundation project The Transformation of the Roman World that ran from 1993-98.Ian Wood, 'Report: The European Science Foundation's Programme on the Transformation of the Roman World and the Emergence of Early Medieval Europe', Early Medieval Europe, 6 (1997), 217-28.Jinty Nelson, 'Why Reinventing Medieval History is a Good Idea', in The Making of Medieval History, ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), , pp. 17-36. Amidst this process, from the 1980s onwards Medieval Studies increasingly responded to intellectual agendas set by critical theory and cultural studies, with empiricism and philology being challenged by or harnessed to topics like the history of the body.Caroline Bynum, ‚ÄúWhy All the Fuss about the Body? A Medievalist's Perspective‚Äù, Critical Inquiry 22/1, 1995, pp. 1-33. In the twenty-first century, globalisation led to arguments that post-war Europeanisation had drawn too tight a boundary around Medieval Studies, this time at the borders of Europe,Little, Lester K., 'Cypress Beams, Kufic Script, and Cut Stone: Rebuilding the Master Narrative of European History', _Speculum_ , 79 (2004), 909-28. with Muslim IberiaRichard Hitchcock, 'Reflections on the Frontier in Early Medieval Iberia', in The Making of Medieval History, ed. by Graham Loud and Martial Staub (York: York Medieval Press, 2017), , pp. 155-66Hisham Aidi, 'The Interference of al-Andalus: Spain, Islam, and the West', Social Text, 24 (2006), 67-88; . and the Orthodox Christian eastMichael Borgolte, 'A Crisis of the Middle Ages?

Thus a range of medievalists have begun working on writing global histories of the Middle Ages ‚Äî while, however, navigating, the risk of imposing Eurocentric terminologies and agendas on the rest of the world.James Belich, John Darwin, and Chris Wickham, 'Introduction: The Prospect of Global History', in _The Prospect of Global History_ , ed. by James Belich, John Darwin, Margret Frenz, and Chris Wickham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), , pp. 322.Moore, Robert I., 'A Global Middle Ages?', in _The Prospect of Global History_ , ed. by James Belich, John Darwin, Margret Frenz, and Chris Wickham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), pp. 80-92.Robinson, Francis, 'Global History from an Islamic Angle', in _The Prospect of Global History_ , ed. by James Belich, John Darwin, Margret Frenz, and Chris Wickham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), pp. 12745.The Global Middle Ages, ed. by Catherine Holmes and Naomi Standen, Past & Present Supplement, 13 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018) (=Past & Present, 238 (November 2018)), https://academic.oup.com/past/issue/238/suppl_13.

Mahabali is a grandson of Prahlada, a descendant of Rishi Kashyapa. There are many versions of his legend in ancient texts such as the Shatapatha Brahmana, Ramayana, Mahabharata and Puranas. His legend is a part of the annual Onam festival in the state of Kerala, and Balipratipada (fourth day of Diwali) festival in the North India,Tulunadu and Karnataka.and also in Kerala history, the Mahabali, the grandson of Prahlada who was a great devotee of Vishnu, is considered to be the noblest and prosperity king, who makes Kingdom into the land of heaven in earth, who was given the greatest boon by Vishnu through his Vamana Avatar. Vishnu also gave him the boon that he will become Lord Indra in the next Manvantara. He asked permission to visit the people of his kingdom on the harvest ceremony to see them live in happiness. Hindu mythologies Vamana avatara of Lord Vishnu stomps on Bali's head, and sends him to the Patala Mahabali is described in early Hindu mythologies as a benevolent and generous king. He ruled without discrimination, and everybody were honest, healthy and happy under his rulehttp://www.madhurima.org/new_madhurima/webpages/AboutOnam.html. Mahabali also temporarily possessed the amrita (nectar for eternal life) obtained by the asuras. The amrita allowed his associates to bring him back to life after his death in one of the wars between suras and asuras. Mahabali was, thus, immune from death. After many wars, the invincible Bali had won the heaven and earth. The suras (Devas) approach Vishnu to save them. Vishnu refused to join the war or kill his own devotee Mahabali. He used a tactical approach instead and incarnated as the dwarf Brahmin avatar, Vamana. While Mahabali was performing Ashvamedha Vedic sacrifices to celebrate his victories and giving away gifts to everyone, Vamana approached him and asked for \\"three steps of land\\". Mahabali granted him the gift. Vamana then metamorphosed into Vishnu's giant Trivikrama form, taking all of heaven in one step and earth in second. Mahabali realized that the Vamana was none other than Vishnu and offered his own head for the third step. Some Hindu texts state that Mahabali was taken to patala (netherworld), some state he was dragged there by Garuda, in others he entered heaven with the touch of Vishnu, while another version states he became chiranjivi (immortal). Others even have Bali admitted into Vaikunta, which was an even higher place than the realm of Devas. According to Hindu mythologies, Vishnu granted Bali a boon whereby he could return to earth every year. The harvest festivals of Balipratipada and Onam are celebrated to mark his yearly homecoming. Literature and inscriptions in Hindu temples suggest that these festivals, featuring colorful decorations, lighted lamps, gift giving, feasts and community events, have been popular in India for more than a millennium. Bali is also featured in the Ramayana where Ravana tries to free him from patala but is unable to. Jain mythologies King Bali is also found in the mythologies of Jainism. He is the sixth of nine Prativasudevas (Prati- narayanas, anti-heroes). He is depicted as an evil king who schemed and attempted to rob Purusha's wife. He is defeated and killed by Purusha. In Jain mythology, the antagonists to Bali are the two sons born to King Mahasiva (Mahasiras): Ananda (the sixth Baladeva) and Purusapundarika (the sixth Vasudeva). Bali is also mentioned in Jain inscriptions, where the patron compares the defeated evil opponents of the current king to Bali. For example, in the Girnar inscriptions of Gujarat dated to about 1231 CE (1288 Vikrama era), minister Vastupala of the Chaulukya dynasty is praised as a great king by Jains, and the inscriptions connect him to Bali because Vastupala gave much charity. Some excerpts from the inscriptions are: :In olden times Bali was pressed down by the foot of Vishnu, the enemy of the demons, from the earth; now the same is done by the hand of Vastupala,... :O Vastupala, Bali has sent thee a message that he has been much pleased by hearing from Narada, who visits the three worlds, that though frequently solicited thou dost not extend thy anger to the needy,... :By the famous minister Vastupala watering the earth with nectarial charities, the pride of Bali and Kalpataru has been greatly lowered... :Let there be continuous salutation to holy Bali and Karna, whose charity though unseen has been the object of so much fame; consequently the people are worthy of worship, and the great minister Vastupala's charity which the people see with their eyes so great that even the world itself can scarcely contain it. Mahabali is a common name and found in other contexts. For example, in Jain history, Mahabali is the name of the son of Bahubali, who was given Bahubali's kingdom before Bahubali became a monk. Cultural sites In Kerala, Mahabali is remembered as the mythical king who lived there. In Tulunadu also, people believe that Mahabali as the King of ancient times of the land and they offer special pooja during 4th day of Deepavali. i.e, 'Bali Padyami'. They call it as 'Balindra Pooje' which involves offering a special dish to the Balindra in plate prepared by Bamboo tree sticks along with a lamp, followed by requesting him by telling folklore song in Tulu which goes like \\" Oh Balindra... Bontel poyina mooji dinataani Bali bala...Koo...Koo\\" which literally translates to \\" Hey Bali, After 3 days of Diwali (which usually comes in Tulu Month 'Bonthel'), Come and accept the food\\". People believe that, on that day King Balindra comes out of Pathala for a day to see his Kingdom. However, in other parts of India, he is believed to have lived and ruled from other locations. For example, in the north the eponymous Balia (Uttar Pradesh) is believed to be his capital. In Maharashtra, the hill town of Mahabaleshwar is considered as his abode before he was sent to Sutala by Vishnu. In Gujarat, it is Bharuch that is linked to him and this is attested to in the Matsya Purana chapter 114. The town of Mahabalipuram in Tamil Nadu is also associated with him and considered his capital.

The parent company was indeed Baton Broadcasting Inc., but the correct meaning of the second \\"B\\" was \\"Broadcast\\" as indicated in Canadian trademark reg. no. TMA446418 and others. ( ), also known as BBS, was a Canadian system of television stations located in Ontario and Saskatchewan, owned by Baton Broadcasting. BBS was the successor to two provincial systems also owned by Baton, the Saskatchewan Television Network (STN) and Ontario Network Television (ONT). During the 1990s, BBS and its predecessors served as a complementary programming service to the CTV Television Network, to which most (but not all) of the system's stations were already affiliated. Shortly after Baton's acquisition of CTV in 1997 and the contemporaneous sale of Baton's independent stations (later re-acquired by Bell and currently part of the parallel CTV Two system), the BBS brand was eliminated, and the system's operations were merged into the CTV network. History Background During its years as a cooperative, CTV did not broadcast a complete primetime schedule. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, it broadcast 60 hours of common programming each week, with a few gaps in primetime for affiliates to schedule locally; in some cases stations could even pick when to air network programs.Friends of Canadian Broadcasting television schedule archive (comparison of different CTV affiliates' spring 1990 schedules) During this same period, CTV's profits began to decline, and by the early 1990s the network was posting losses, largely due to increased competition from the CanWest Global System and other independent stations. Many affiliate groups, such as Baton and WIC - the latter already owning several independent stations - decided they would prefer to buy and air more of their own programming. Accordingly, as part of CTV's 1993 restructuring, network programming was reduced to 42.5 hours (and soon after to 40), including 12 hours in primetime.Decision CRTC 94-33 (1994 CTV network licence renewal) From this point on (until 1998), CTV network programming only took up about half of affiliates' primetime schedules. Ontario Network Television: 1991-1994 ONT was initiated in 1991, consisting of eight CTV affiliates - seven owned by Baton (CFTO, CJOH, CHRO, and the MCTV stations) and Electrohome's CKCO. Initially providing 10.5 hours of common programming each week, this was soon expanded to 35 hours. While ONT was a secondary affiliation and not a separate network from CTV, some claimed it was a first step towards the Baton stations becoming a separate network. Indeed, Baton began to bid against CTV for the rights to new U.S. series. However, Baton's president at the time, Douglas Bassett, contended it was merely a \\"marketing vehicle\\" to compete with CanWest Global's CIII-TV, a single station which served almost all of Ontario.CTV: The Television Wars, Susan Gittins, Toronto: Stoddart Publishing, 1999 In 1993, Baton acquired two independent stations, CFPL and CKNX, and launched a third, CHWI. These stations replaced CKCO within ONT. In response, CKCO and WIC's CHCH-TV Hamilton announced a joint initiative of their own, known as \\"Market One Television\\";Stations join forces, David Chilton, Strategy, July 12, 1993 however, this partnership was short-lived. In addition to the CTV affiliates and independent stations, some ONT (and later BBS) programming may have aired on Baton's CBC affiliates, part of twinstick operations in northern Ontario. In the rest of Canada, Baton sublicensed its programming to individual stations, usually CTV affiliates. Even the ONT brand was seen from time to time in the rest of Canada, mainly through Baton-produced Toronto Blue Jays games. The BBS years: 1994-1997 CFTO BBS logo. In October 1994, Baton hired the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company to help evaluate how to proceed with its national expansion plans. McKinsey's report recommended, first and foremost, that Baton attempt to take control of the CTV trademark, which it saw as one of the most valuable brands in Canada, through the acquisition of as many other CTV affiliates (and their corresponding shares in the network) as possible. However, the report also recommended that Baton create a new national brand as a backup, to help reduce the damage should Baton's gambit fail and CTV pass into a competitor's hands. This new brand turned out to be BBS, with a logo adapted from CFTO's multicoloured-iris logo. Baton's local stations dropped their individual logos and adopted the new BBS symbol, with the station call letters positioned beneath. In contrast, ONT was simply a secondary brand and had not replaced local station logos. Despite the value Baton placed in the CTV brand, BBS became more a more prominent part of these stations' branding than CTV itself. BBS replaced ONT in fall 1994, with the addition of Baton's six stations in Saskatchewan - CTV affiliates CKCK-TV in Regina, CFQC-TV in Saskatoon, CICC-TV in Yorkton, and CIPA-TV in Prince Albert, and CBC affiliates CKOS-TV in Yorkton and CKBI-TV in Prince Albert. They had been jointly branded as the \\"Saskatchewan Television Network\\" since 1987. Programming included U.S. series such as Law & Order, Home Improvement, Melrose Place, and Ellen, the soap opera Family Passions, a Saturday morning block of mainly Disney cartoons branded as BBS Master Control (including The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa and Disney's One Saturday Morning), news and talk programming such as Sunday Edition and The Dini Petty Show, and sports programming such as Blue Jays games, which were again syndicated to other Canadian stations. As a result of the Baton-Electrohome alliance, CKCO (now jointly owned by both companies) joined the system in 1996. Baton and Electrohome also jointly acquired CFCN-TV in Calgary around the same time; both CFCN and Electrohome-owned CFRN-TV in Edmonton aired much of the BBS lineup, but did not actively use the BBS brand.Internet Archive Wayback Machine for www.cfrntv.ca and www.cfcn.ca Acquisition of CTV In 1997, Baton bought controlling interest in CTV, and became the sole corporate owner of the network later that year after the remaining station owners sold their shares. Baton continued to consider the long-standing CTV brand much preferable to its lesser-known BBS moniker, and had not bothered to introduce the latter brand to its new acquisitions. Almost immediately after its purchase of CTV was complete, Baton introduced new station logos on all of its CTV-affiliated stations that incorporated the network brand, and began using the CTV logo in all programming and promotions where the BBS logo was previously used, even though these programs remained separate from the CTV network service proper. The BBS name was completely dropped no later than the end of January 1998, and Baton itself changed its corporate name to CTV Inc. later that year. Nevertheless, BBS lived on in a very limited sense until 2001, since CTV maintained a separate stream of programming not part of the CTV network service - though as noted above, from this point on such shows were branded as CTV programs on the network's O&Os.; This structure was necessary because the \\"old\\" CTV's affiliation agreements, which generally limited network service to 40 hours a week, remained in force. For instance, CHAN (then known as BCTV) was Vancouver's CTV affiliate but carried no more than 40 hours of CTV programming (for instance, in its final seasons as a CTV affiliate, it did not broadcast Canada AM at all, airing local news instead, although sister station CHEK did air CanAM) while CTV-owned independent station CIVT carried the remainder. As its establishment came shortly before Baton adopted the CTV name for its stations, CIVT did not use the BBS name, instead branding as Vancouver Television (VTV). Other affiliates such as CKY in Winnipeg, NTV in Newfoundland and Labrador, and to a lesser extent CFCF in Montreal, usually acquired additional programming, as they had from BBS. However, these programs were not added to the base 40-hour network schedule (which was part of a traditional network arrangement whereby the network retained most of the ad inventory and affiliates were compensated with airtime payments) - instead, stations had to pay the network for these additional programs, although they would sell all ads locally (which made the practice more akin to all-cash syndication rather than the more contemporary U.S. practice of reverse compensation). Series would sometimes switch back and forth between network and non-network status, and in limited cases alternate programming was supplied to affiliates in the event that specific episodes of a non-network program (e.g., Who Wants to Be a Millionaire) were scheduled for a timeslot that had been previously allocated as network time. On September 1, 2001, CIVT became the Vancouver CTV owned-and-operated station, displacing BCTV and CHEK; around the same time, CTV acquired CKY and CFCF, giving the network's O&O; stations group coverage of virtually all major Canadian markets. As a result, CTV elected not to renew its national network licence with the CRTC, and the largely artificial distinction between network and non- network programming was eliminated entirely at this point. CTV would later re- apply for a separate regional licence used specifically to provide programming to affiliates owned by third parties.Decision 2001-509 In this sense, CTV as it presently operates could be seen as an enlarged BBS by another name, rather than the direct successor to the \\"original\\" CTV; however, for most viewers, this is a technicality of little practical significance. Baton's independents and newly disaffiliated CHRO were sold to CHUM Limited, becoming NewNet stations; however CTVglobemedia (now Bell Media), Baton's successor as a corporate entity, reacquired them as part of its purchase of CHUM Limited in 2007. These stations are now operated by Bell Media under the CTV Two banner. Baton's CBC affiliates were later sold to the public broadcaster, and became repeaters of other CBC owned-and-operated stations. CTVgm would later acquire another CBC affiliate, CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba, as part of the CHUM purchase, which closed down in late 2009 after a variety of efforts to sell the station failed. Bell Media then acquired two additional two CBC affiliates in interior British Columbia (CJDC-TV Dawson Creek and CFTK-TV Terrace) as part of its 2013 purchase of Astral Media, eventually converting both to CTV Two stations in 2016.

It was later rebranded as LM in 1992 and ceased publication in March 2000 following a successful libel lawsuit brought by ITN.\\"ITN wins Bosnian war libel case\\". BBC News. 15 March 2000 It was promptly resurrected as Spiked, an Internet magazine.  Living Marxism's aims  Living Marxism's introduction summarised its outlook as follows:  Views  Views expounded with regularity in LM included \\"fear culture\\", for example by questioning the then media coverage of AIDS as a predominantly homosexual disease in the West. Its critique covered media coverage in Africa and the developing world in the context of Western intervention, underdevelopment and poverty. It debated environmentalist claims that limiting consumption was a progressive view. The magazine raised concerns about the left's rejection of scientific thought and critique, especially of medicine, biotechnology and nuclear physics. LM writers critiqued the media portrayal of the civil wars in Rwanda and Bosnia by questioning the use of the term \\"genocide\\" to describe the conflicts. It has been stated by environmentalists such as George MonbiotMonbiot, George (9 December 2003). \\"Invasion of the entryists\\". The Guardian (London). and Peter Melchett that the group of writers associated with LM continue to constitute a LM network pursuing an ideologically motivated \\"anti-environmentalist\\" agenda under the guise of promoting humanism.Melchett, Peter (19 April 2007). \\"Clear intentions\\". The Guardian (London).Profiles: Martin Durkin, LobbyWatch. Retrieved 17 April 2007. Writers who used to write for Living Marxism reject this as a \\"McCarthyite conspiracy theory\\".  ITN vs. LM  In the first issue where the journal was renamed LM, editor Mick Hume published an article by German journalist Thomas Deichmann which claimed that ITN had misrepresented the Bosnian war in its coverage in 1992. The publishers of LM, Informinc (LM) Ltd., were sued for libel by ITN. The case initially caused international condemnation of ITN as one of LMs critics, the journalist George Monbiot, who wrote in Prospect magazine: However, Monbiot continued: The article \\"The picture that fooled the world\\" argued that ITN's footage in which an emaciated Bosnian Muslim man stood behind a barbed wire fence was designed to portray a Nazi-style extermination camp while Deichmann claimed: \\"It was not a prison, and certainly not a 'concentration camp', but a collection centre for refugees, many of whom went there seeking safety and could leave again if they wished\\". However, an examination of the substance of this case by a professor of cultural and political geography at Durham University argues that the key claims made by Deichmann and LM are \\"erroneous and flawed\\". The libel case went against LM and in March 2000 the magazine was forced to close. Reporters Penny Marshall and Ian Williams were each awarded ¬£150,000 over the LM story and the magazine was ordered to pay ¬£75,000 for libelling ITN in a February 1997 article. Looking back Hume commented in The Times: In contrast, Professor Campbell of Durham University summarised his study of the case as follows: > [A]s strange as existing British libel law is, it had an important and > surprisingly beneficial effect in the case of ITN vs LM. The LM defendants > and Thomas Deichmann were properly represented at the trial and were able to > lay out all the details of their claim that the ITN reporters had > \\"deliberately misrepresented\\" the situation at Trnopolje. Having charged > 'deliberate misrepresentation', they needed to prove 'deliberate > misrepresentation'. To this end, the LM defendants were able to cross- > examine Penny Marshall and Ian Williams, as well as every member of the ITN > crews who were at the camps, along with other witnesses. (That they didn't > take up the opportunity to cross-examine the Bosnian doctor imprisoned at > Trnopolje, who featured in the ITN stories and was called to testify on the > conditions he and others suffered, was perhaps the moment any remaining > shred of credibility for LM's allegations evaporated). They were able to > show the ITN reports to the court, including the rushes from which the final > TV stories were edited, and conduct a forensic examination of the visuals > they alleged were deceitful. And all of this took place in front of a jury > of twelve citizens who they needed to convince about the truthfulness of > their allegations. They failed. The jury found unanimously against LM and > awarded the maximum possible damages. So it was not ITN that bankrupted LM. > It was LM's lies about the ITN reports that bankrupted themselves, morally > and financially. Despite their failure, those who lied about the ITN reports > have had no trouble obtaining regular access to the mainstream media in > Britain, where they continue to make their case as though the 2000 court > verdict simply didn't exist. Their freedom of speech has thus not been > permanently infringed.

He described himself: > I was born here in Amsterdam. My father was a land holder of 700 acres [2.8 > km¬≤] here, adjoining the city on both sides of the river, and lived, as I > now live, in a large brick house on the south bank of the Mohawk visible as > you enter Amsterdam from the east.

H. M. Kallen wrote of Blood: > He was born in 1832 and lived for eighty-six years. During that time he > wrote much, but unsystematically. His favorite form of publication was > letters to newspapers, mainly local newspapers with a small circulation. > These letters dealt with an astonishing diversity of subjects, from local > petty politics or the tricks of spiritualist mediums to principles of > industry and finance and profundities of metaphysics. Early books included The Philosophy of Justice Between God and Man (1851) and Optimism: The Lesson of Ages (1860), a Christian mystical vision of the pursuit of happiness from Blood's distinctly American perspective; on the title page of the book, Blood described it as \\"A compendium of democratic theology, designed to illustrate necessities whereby all things are as they are, and to reconcile the discontents of men with the perfect love and power of ever-present God.\\" During his lifetime he was best known for his poetry, which included The Bride of the Iconoclast, Justice, and The Colonnades.

Early life Graham grew up in Oulton Broad in Lowestoft, attending Kirkley High School with the Hawkins brothers. Not particularly sporty, Graham would spend his break times isolated in the music room where he began to play the drums. After school Graham studied art at Lowestoft College. In 1998 and 1999, Graham studied Film and Television at Salisbury College, gaining an Higher National Diploma. Career After leaving Salisbury College, Graham returned to Lowestoft and worked in a Sanyo factory for six months to raise money to move to London. In the year 2000 he moved to Finsbury Park, soon relocating to Camden Town, where he remained for over ten years. His first band in London was Q*Sling fronted by Norwegian born Paul Ronney Angel, who later went on to form The Urban Voodoo Machine. The Darkness was conceived at a millennium eve party by the Hawkins brothers, Justin and Dan. The line up was completed some months later by Graham and bass player Frankie Poullain. Graham played on three studio albums: Permission to Land, One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back and Hot Cakes. In 2006, The Darkness split due to Justin Hawkins leaving. Graham and Dan Hawkins went on to form The Stone Gods, recruiting Toby Macfarlaine and promoting Darkness guitar technician Richie Edwards to frontman. In July 2008, it was announced that he was permanently leaving the band due to health issues.Sad but True SPIN magazine confirmed that Graham was suffering with avascular necrosis, a rare condition causing lack of blood supply to the femur. In 2009, Graham underwent bilateral hip surgery (a major operation) which was a complete success.

We love Ed and we wish him happiness.\\" Since 2015, Graham has been the subject of a fine art photographic documentary by rock photographer Nick Elliott recording Graham's personal and professional life since his departure from The Darkness. In 2015, Graham formed another band with singer-songwriter Angus Duprey, brother of Fuzz Duprey. The band, Puppets to the Supreme Commander, intended to release an EP and play UK shows ahead of an album release. In 2017, Graham performed drums for a one-off band, The Venus Reaction. The project, set up by friend and Puppets to the Supreme Commander bandmate David Donley, also featured Amie Conradine, Jim Lowe, and Glen Matlock of the Sex Pistols.

Prior to the emergence of military rule in the early 1980s, Ikeja was a well planned, clean and quiet residential and commercial town with shopping malls, pharmacies and government reservation areas. The Murtala Mohammed International Airport is located in Ikeja. Ikeja is also home to Femi Kuti's Africa Shrine and Lagbaja's Motherland, both venues for live music.

History Ikeja, which was formally called \\"Akeja\\" was named after a deity of the Awori people of Ota. It was originally settled by the Awori people, and the area was raided for slaves until the mid-19th century. Early in the 20th century it became an agricultural hinterland for Lagos. The opening of the Lagos-Ibadan railway in 1901 and the growth of Lagos as a port transformed Ikeja into a residential and industrial suburb of that city. In the mid-1960s an industrial estate was established, and in 1976 Ikeja became the capital of Lagos state.

Begun in 1997 as a small market of only 10 shops, the current market now has well over 3000. While most vendors provide the expected computer sales and repair services, it is also possible to find sales and repair services for various types of office equipment and electronic devices. By 2019, the little shops at Computer Village had grown to multiple-storey shopping malls. Many of the single-floor buildings have been developed into larger buildings, housing several shops that distribute and repair mobile phones, laptops, printers and other electronic devices. Nearly all the major Nigerian banks have branches around the market. As the market is unplanned, it has experienced difficulties in its growth, with some local residents expressing frustration at the market's expansion. Traffic around the area has become very congested, and it can be almost impossible to find a place to park.

The series follows Haru Glory, a teenager on a quest to find the five pieces of the sacred stone Rave in order to bring peace to the world by defeating the criminal group Demon Card. Mashima created this series with the idea of travelling around the world and was presented with difficulties in its serialization due to its considerable length. The manga was serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine from July 21, 1999 through July 10, 2005, and published in thirty-five tank≈çbon volumes by Kodansha. The manga series was licensed for an English release in North America by Tokyopop until Kodansha allowed their contract to expire. It was also adapted into a fifty-one episode anime series by Studio Deen. The anime premiered on TBS on October 13, 2001 and ran until September 28, 2002. Tokyopop also licensed the anime adaptation which premiered on Cartoon Network in the United States on June 5, 2004 as part of the Toonami programming block and re-broadcast on Syfy in 2009. The manga series has received generally positive critical response with praise commonly aimed towards the storyline and artwork. On the other hand, the localized anime adaptation has been panned for the multiple edits Tokyopop made to the original version which resulted in uninteresting and confusing dialogue, as well as unappealing music. Plot In 0015, the world is corrupted by Dark Bring, dark stones that bestow powerful magic with different abilities to their owners. The Dark Brings are used by the Raregroove Kingdom, and the Symphonia Kingdom fight against them with their five powerful Rave stones. Shiba Roses, the Rave Master, attempts to destroy Sinclaire, the \\"mother\\" of all of the Dark Brings, with the Ten Commandments sword. However, the aftermath causes a massive explosion known as Overdrive, destroying one-tenth of the known world. Shiba, protected from the disaster by his special guardian \\"dog\\" Plue, holds onto the Rave required to power his sword. Plue and the four remaining Raves, however, get scattered around the world. Fifty years later, sixteen-year-old Haru Glory lives on the peaceful Garage Island with his older sister, Cattleya. Shortly after Haru accidentally fishes Plue up, Shiba arrives wishing to reclaim Plue, but a group of terrorists from the Demon Card organization appear to kill Shiba. Shiba tells Haru that he is the second Rave Master, entrusting the Ten Commandments, Plue, and his Rave to him. Seeking power to defeat Demon Card, Haru and Plue set off on a journey to find the missing Rave stones. Upon arriving at the mainland, Haru befriends a girl named Elie, who has no recollection of her past. During their journey, Haru encounters enemies from Demon Card who eventually become his allies, including Shuda and Sieg Hart. Haru later meets a diverse group of allies, including Hamrio Musica, grandson of a blacksmith; Let Dahaka and Julia, two who appear human but are in fact of the Dragon Race; Griffon Kato, a strange blue creature and Plue's friend; Ruby, a penguin and a casino owner; Belnika, a mage; and Niebel, Sieg's close friend. He also encounters Gale \\"King\\" Raregroove, the king of the Raregroove Kingdom and leader of Demon Card. On the Tower of Din, Haru reunites with his absent father Gale Glory to defeat King and end Demon Card. Although they win, Gale sacrifices himself to save his son from Din's destruction. Some time later, King's son, Lucia, appears and revives Demon Card. He wishes to capture Elie to use the magical energy known as Etherion hidden within her body. While facing Lucia and his forces, Haru's group also learn of the mythical creature known as Endless, which threatens mankind by provoking another Overdrive and can only be destroyed with Etherion. Using all Sinclaires, Lucia absorbs Endless. Lucia's objective is to destroy the world, which is actually a parallel dimension created by his descendant with Etherion after the original was ruined by a plague and his family was cursed as a result. After Haru finds all of the Raves, Elie uses Etherion to combine them. In order to avoid another Overdrive, Haru and his friends oppose Lucia and his strongest enemies in the Star Memory. Although Haru defeats Lucia, he is absorbed by Endless and convinces Elie to destroy it even if it means taking his life. One year later, Elie has lost her memories of Haru, and she and the others visit his grave. Haru appears alive thanks to the Star Memory's magic and reunites with Elie, who then remembers him. The warriors go their separate ways, and Haru and Elie return to Garage Island to live together. Development Manga author Hiro Mashima expressed both joy and difficulty in making the series due its themes. Hiro Mashima created Rave Master with the idea of travelling around the world. Composed of thirty-five volumes, Mashima comments that although it was sometimes difficult to think of how to develop the storyline, he still remembers enjoying the making of Rave Master. Additionally, he regards that the series' end was \\"a little sentimental, a little sad.\\" In early chapters Mashima had multiple difficulties with the series' backgrounds. Nevertheless, across the volumes Mashima realized how the art was evolving resulting in most appealing pages. During publication, Rave Master was supposed to end in its ninth volume with King and Demon Card's defeat and all of the plot's mysteries resolved. This was planned since Mashima had the desire to make a new manga. In the end, he decided to continue with Rave Master following King's arc after finding such an ending too contrived. In both Rave Master and his other manga Fairy Tail, Mashima wants to make justice prevail but also make readers understand the villains' reasons to fight the main character in order to make them more complex characters. In some cases, Mashima admitted having writer's block as he did not plan the abilities of certain characters with some readers referring to the Dark Brings as \\"too convenient.\\" The protagonist, Haru, was designed prior to developing the story as he was a male character Mashima always wanted to draw. His sidekick, Plue, was also designed much earlier when he was in high school. Plue was given his own sidestory much to Mashima's surprise because of the funny looking characters designed for a shonen magazine. Media Manga Rave Master began serialization in Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine from issue 32 of 1999, published on July 21, 1999 and ran for 296 chapters until its conclusion in issue 35 of 2005, published on September 10, 2005. It was published in thirty-five collected volumes by Kodansha, with the first volume released in November 1999 and the final volume released in September 2005. The series was later rereleased in eighteen bunkoban volumes between August 10, 2006 and April 12, 2007. Rave Master was licensed for an English release in North America by Tokyopop, which released 32 volumes of the series. On August 31, 2009, Tokyopop announced that they would not be completing the series as their licenses with Kodansha expired and Kodansha required that they immediately stop publication of all previously licensed series, including Rave Master. The next month, it was announced that Del Rey Manga had acquired the license and would begin publishing the remaining volumes in 2010. The last three volumes were published in a single omnibus volume. Del Rey never released the earlier volumes before their license expired. In 2017 Kodansha USA licensed the series for release with the intention to re-release all thirty-five volumes in digital format,Kodansha Adds Rave Master, All Out!!, Shojo Fight Manga Digitally which were all released together on October 3, 2017. The volumes are available on digital platforms such as Amazon Kindle and ComiXology.Rave Master, Volume 1 The series is licensed for regional language releases in French by Glenat, in Spanish by Norma Editorial, and in Italian by Editions Star Comics. Egmont Manga & Anime licensed Rave Master for a German release, including serializing it in their monthly anthology Manga Power. Rave Master was also one of the first manga series released in Spanish in North America by Public Square Books. In 2011, Mashima authored a crossover one-shot between Rave Master and Fairy Tail. It was published in Kodansha's Magazine Special May issue. Anime The series was adapted into a fifty-one episode anime series, entitled Groove Adventure Rave, by Studio Deen. It was directed by Takashi Watanabe and the music was composed by Kenji Kawai. The anime premiered on TBS on October 13, 2001 and ran until September 28, 2002. The anime series is based on the first twelve volumes of the manga series. The series was also collected in a total of seventeen DVD volumes between February 6, 2002 and June 4, 2003. Tokyopop licensed the series for release and broadcast in North America. As with the manga, Tokyopop released the series under the name Rave Master. Tokyopop edited the series for content and length, hired Rita Majkut to produce the English-language version, which was recorded at Bill & Ted's Recording Studio in Burbank, and contracted Glenn Scott Lacey to compose an alternate musical score. The ADR writer was Bob Buchholz, and Marc Handler was the voice director for all of the episodes. The leading actors for the English-language version were Yuri Lowenthal, Doug Erholtz, Michelle Ruff, Tom Kenny, and Mona Marshall. The English dubbed version aired on Cartoon Network in the United States, premiering in June 2004, as part of the Toonami programming block. The series' second half premiered on January 22, 2005. It was also on the MiGUZi weekday afternoon after-school action block and its Sunday Morning daytime lineup of Summer 2005. Later, Syfy had begun airing the dubbed episodes on March 16, 2009 as part of its \\"Ani-Monday\\" programming block and finished on September 21, 2009. Tokyopop released three DVD volumes of the series and in 2010 it collected the entire series. The one-shot crossover between Rave Master and Fairy Tail was adapted into an original video animation with Mashima himself acting as supervisor to the project and had expanded the original chapter to include more characters from Rave Master. It was released on August 16, 2013 alongside the thirty-ninth volume of Fairy Tail. CDs The Japanese audio by Kenji Kawai was released in a total of four CD soundtracks by King Records. Geneon also published a CD based on the Japanese soundtrack for English release under the title of Rave Master: Music Side. Video games There are six video games based on Rave Master published by Konami. Three games were released for the PlayStation including a role-playing games Groove Adventure Rave and its sequel , and platforming game Plue no Daibouken from Groove Adventure Rave. For Nintendo's consoles Konami released both Groove Adventure Rave and Rave Master: Special Attack Force! (Groove Adventure Rave: Hikari to Yami no Daikessen 2), two fighting games for the Game Boy Advance, and Rave Master, which was released on the Nintendo GameCube. Reception The Rave Master manga has been well received with its Western release appearing in Diamond Comic Distributors's graphic novels charts. Publications for manga and anime also had positive impressions with Jason Thompson's book Manga: The Complete Guide giving it a positive review of 3 out of 4 stars. It states that Rave Master had a relatively shaky start, in terms of storyline and art. However, it states that about part way through the first major story arc, the series began to improve and set itself apart from other manga series. Like most reviewers, they stated that Rave Master had a collection of likeable characters. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment also enjoyed the series recommending people to buy multiple volumes rather than one to enjoy the connected story arcs. He praised the series' fight scenes coupled with the emotional content that makes the series worth reading. UK Anime Network writer Rory Carlyle shared similar comments as he viewed the series to be \\"pretty good\\" despite having common standards seen in multiple sh≈çnen manga. Carlyle was surprised by the multiple character designs that included humanoid and superdeformed characters besides common ones like Haru. The artwork was also praised by Anime News Network's Allen Divers who referred to the series as \\"a try before you buy\\" based on the simple storyline. In contrast to the printed version, the localized TV series has garnered some significant criticism mainly for its edits. Critics were mainly concerned about how the script was rewritten for the series' English release which resulted in confusing character interactions and unfunny humor. The animation was praised although the fight scenes were not found entertaining. Both Anime News Network and DVDTalk found that the series was better suited towards a young audience and expected TokyoPop to release an uncut version of the series to attract older fans. The exclusive English soundtrack was also heavily criticized for not fitting with the series while the English voice acting was found underwhelming.

DHA is primarily used as an ingredient in sunless tanning products. It is often derived from plant sources such as sugar beets and sugar cane, and by the fermentation of glycerin. Chemistry DHA is a hygroscopic white crystalline powder. It has a sweet cooling taste and a characteristic odor. It is the simplest of all ketoses and has no chiral center or optical activity. The normal form is a dimer (2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)-1,4-dioxane-2,5-diol) which is slowly soluble in one part water and 15 parts ethanol. When freshly prepared, it reverts rapidly to the monomer in solution. :Conversion of dihydroxyacetone dimer to monomer The monomer is very soluble in water, ethanol, diethyl ether, acetone and toluene. DHA may be prepared, along with glyceraldehyde, by the mild oxidation of glycerol, for example with hydrogen peroxide and a ferrous salt as catalyst. It can also be prepared in high yield and selectivity at room temperature from glycerol using cationic palladium-based catalysts with oxygen, air or benzoquinone acting as co-oxidants. Glyceraldehyde is a structural isomer of dihydroxyacetone. Biology Its phosphorylated form, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), takes part in glycolysis, and it is an intermediate product of fructose metabolism. Uses DHA was first recognized as a skin coloring agent by German scientists in the 1920s. Through its use in the X-ray process, it was noted as causing the skin surface to turn brown when spilled. In the 1950s, Eva Wittgenstein at the University of Cincinnati did further research with dihydroxyacetone. Her studies involved using DHA as an oral drug for assisting children with glycogen storage disease. The children received large doses of DHA by mouth, and sometimes spat or spilled the substance onto their skin. Healthcare workers noticed that the skin turned brown after a few hours of DHA exposure. Eva Wittgenstein continued to experiment with DHA, painting liquid solutions of it onto her own skin. She was able to consistently reproduce the pigmentation effect, and noted that DHA did not appear to penetrate beyond the stratum corneum, or dead skin surface layer (the FDA eventually concluded this is not entirely truehttps://abcnews.go.com/Health/safety-popular-spray-tans-question- protected/story?id=16542918&page;=3). Research then continued on DHA's skin coloring effect in relation to treatment for patients suffering from vitiligo. This skin browning effect is non-toxic, and is a result of a Maillard reaction. DHA reacts chemically with the amino acids in the protein keratin, the major component of the skin surface. Different amino acids react to DHA in different ways, producing different tones of coloration from yellow to brown. The resulting pigments are called melanoidins. These are similar in coloration to melanin, the natural substance in the deeper skin layers which brown or \\"tan\\", from exposure to UV rays. Winemaking Both acetic acid bacteria Acetobacter aceti and Gluconobacter oxydans use glycerol as a carbon source to form dihydroxyacetone. DHA is formed by ketogenesis of glycerol. It can affect the sensory quality of the wine with sweet/etherish properties. DHA can also react with proline to produce a \\"crust-like\\" aroma. Dihydroxyacetone can affect the anti-microbial activity in wine, as it has the ability to bind SO2. Sunless tanning Coppertone introduced the first consumer sunless tanning lotion into the marketplace in the 1960s. This product was called ‚ÄúQuick Tan‚Äù or ‚ÄúQT‚Äù. It was sold as an overnight tanning agent, and other companies followed suit with similar products. Consumers soon tired of this product due to unattractive results such as orange palms, streaking and poor coloration. Because of the QT experience, many people still associate sunless tanning with fake-looking orange tans. In the 1970s the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added DHA permanently to their list of approved cosmetic ingredients. By the 1980s, new sunless tanning formulations appeared on the market and refinements in the DHA manufacturing process created products that produced a more natural looking color and better fading. Consumer concerns surrounding damage associated with UV tanning options spurred further popularity of sunless tanning products as an alternative to UV tanning. Dozens of brands appeared on drugstore shelves, in numerous formulations. Today, DHA is the main active ingredient in many sunless tanning skincare preparations. Lotion manufacturers also produce a wide variety of sunless tanning preparations that replace DHA with natural bronzing agents such as black walnut shell. DHA may be used alone or combined with other tanning components such as erythrulose. DHA is considered the most effective sun-free tanning additive. Sunless tanning products contain DHA in concentrations ranging from 1% to 20%. Most drugstore products range from 3% to 5%, with professional products ranging from 5% to 20%. The percentages correspond with the product coloration levels from light to dark. Lighter products are more beginner- friendly, but may require multiple coats to produce the desired color depth. Darker products produce a dark tan in one coat, but are also more prone to streaking, unevenness, or off-color tones. The artificial tan takes 2 to 4 hours to begin appearing on the skin surface, and will continue to darken for 24 to 72 hours, depending on formulation type. Once the darkening effect has occurred, the tan will not sweat off or wash away with soap or water. It will fade gradually over 3 to 10 days. Exfoliation, prolonged water submersion, or heavy sweating can lighten the tan, as these all contribute to rapid dead skin cell exfoliation (the dead skin cells are the tinted portion of the sunless tan). Current sunless tanners are formulated into sprays, lotions, gels, mousses, and cosmetic wipes. Professional applied products include spray tanning booths, airbrush tan applications, and hand applied lotions, gels, mousses and wipes. DHA safety considerations For the 24 hours after self-tanner (containing high DHA levels, ~5%) is applied, the skin is especially susceptible to free-radical damage from sunlight, according to a 2007 study led by Katinka Jung of the Gematria Test Lab in Berlin. Forty minutes after the researchers treated skin samples with high levels of DHA they found that more than 180 percent additional free radicals formed during sun exposure compared with untreated skin. Another self-tanner ingredient, erythrulose, produced a similar response at high levels. For a day after self- tanner application, excessive sun exposure should be avoided and sunscreen should be worn outdoors, they say; an antioxidant cream could also minimize free radical production. Although some self-tanners contain sunscreen, its effect will not last long after application, and a fake tan itself will not protect the skin from UV exposure. The study by Jung et al. further confirms earlier results demonstrating that dihydroxyacetone in combination with dimethylisosorbide enhances the process of (sun-based) tanning. This earlier study also found that dihydroxyacetone also has an effect on the amino acids and nucleic acids which is bad for the skin. The free radicals are in part due to the action of UV light on AGE (advanced glycation end products) such as Amadori products (a type of AGE) as a result of the reaction of DHA with the skin. AGEs are behind the damage to the skin that occurs with high blood sugar in diabetes where similar glycation occurs. Some of the damage from AGE is independent of UV light. A study showed glycation of a protein increases its free-radical production rate nearly fifty-fold. Although some self-tanners contain sunscreen, its effect will not last as long as the tan. The skin browning of a sunless tan may provide some UV protection (up to SPF 3), but this low-level protection should be supplemented with additional protection. The stated SPF for the product is only applicable for a few hours after application of the self-tanner. Despite darkening of the skin, an individual is just as susceptible to harmful UV rays, therefore an overall sun protection is still very necessary.http://www.dermnetnz.org/treatments/dihydroxyacetone.html/ There may also be some inhibition of vitamin D production in DHA-treated skin. Contact dermatitis is occasionally reported, and a recent study showed that DHA causes severe contact dermatitis in Mexican hairless dogs. DHA-based sunless tanning has been recommended by the Skin Cancer Foundation, American Academy of Dermatology Association, Canadian Dermatology Association and the American Medical Association as a safer alternative to sun-bathing. The use of DHA in 'tanning' booths as an all-over spray has not been approved by the FDA, since safety data to support this use has not been submitted to the agency for review and evaluation.https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductandIngredientSafety/ProductInformation/ucm134064.htm A June 2012 FDA report claims the main chemical found inside that spray - DHA - is potentially hazardous when inhaled. Some of the DHA if inhaled can cause damage to cells and possibly lead to cancer according to physicians.https://abcnews.go.com/Health/safety-popular-spray-tans-question- protected/story?id=16542918&singlePage;=true An opinionhttp://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_048.pdf issued by the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety, concluding spray tanning with DHA did not pose risk, has been heavily criticized by specialists.https://abcnews.go.com/Health/safety-popular-spray- tans-question-protected/story?id=16542918&page;=4 This is because the cosmetics industry in Europe chose the evidence to review, according to the commission itself. Thus, nearly every report the commission's eventual opinion referenced came from studies that were never published or peer-reviewed and, in the majority of cases, were performed by companies or industry groups linked to the manufacturing of DHA. The industry left out nearly all of the peer-reviewed studies published in publicly available scientific journals that identified DHA as a potential mutagen. A study by scientists from the Department of Dermatology, Bispebjerg Hospital, published in Mutation Research has concluded DHA 'induces DNA damage, cell-cycle block and apoptosis' in cultured cells. More recent research has shown that DHA induces stress response gene expression and signaling in reconstructed human epidermis and cultured keratinocytes, as obvious from rapid activation of phospho-protein signal transduction [p-p38, p-Hsp27(S15/S78), p-eIF2Œ±] and gene expression changes (HSPA6, HMOX1, CRYAB, CCL3). In the report released to ABC News, FDA scientists concluded that DHA does not stop at the outer dead layers of skin. They wrote: \\"The fate of DHA remaining in skin is an important issue, since high DHA skin levels were found.\\" They added that tests they performed revealed that much of the DHA applied to skin actually ended up in the living layers of skin. They concluded: \\"This leaves about 11 percent of the applied DHA dose absorbed remaining in the [living] epidermis and dermis.\\" A toxicologist and lung specialist at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine (Dr. Rey Panettieri) has commented, \\"The reason I'm concerned is the deposition of the tanning agents into the lungs could really facilitate or aid systemic absorption  that is, getting into the bloodstream. These compounds in some cells could actually promote the development of cancers or malignancies, and if that's the case then we need to be wary of them.\\" References External links * How Stuff Works * US FDA/CFSAN - Tanning Pills * American Academy of Dermatology on Self Tanners * DHA and Vitiligo  * New Zealand Dermatological Society recommends sunless tanners Category:Cosmetics chemicals Category:Diols Category:Alpha-hydroxy ketones Category:Trioses ","title":"Dihydroxyacetone"},{"id":"558547","text":"Aust Cliff. The scale is indicated by the two people on the beach at the right of the image. Aust is a small village in South Gloucestershire, England, about north of Bristol and about south west of Gloucester. It is located on the eastern side of the Severn estuary, close to the eastern end of the Severn Bridge, now part of the M48 motorway. The village has a chapel, a church and a public house. There is a large area of farmland on the river bank, which is sometimes flooded due to the high tidal range of the Severn. Aust Cliff, above the Severn, is located about from the village. The civil parish of Aust includes the villages of Elberton and Littleton-upon-Severn. History Overview Aust, on the River Severn, was at one end of an ancient Roman road that let to Cirencester. Its name, Aust, may be one of the very few English place-names to be derived from the Latin Augusta. The name of Aust is recorded in 793 or 794 as Austan (terram aet Austan v manentes) when it was returned to the Church of Worcester after having been taken by King Offa's earl, Bynna. In Domesday, Aust Cliff was recorded as Austreclive, \\"clive\\" being a Middle English spelling of cliff. and the estate was held by Turstin FitzRolf in 1066. In 1368 the area was called Augst, \\"the short unmistakable form of Augusta. Historically Aust was a village and manor in the parish of Henbury. Aust church It was reported as a part of the church of Worcester's Westbury on Trym estate in the Domesday book. About 1100 Winebaud de Ballon gave the church to the Abbey of St. Vincent at Le Mans. In the 14th century, the chapel at Aust was part of the Church of Westbury. The Lollard theologian John Wycliffe (died 1384) is by tradition said to have been prebend of Aust and to have preached there, yet Baker (1901) was unable to find any record of such an appointment in the diocesan registers at Worcester, which see held Aust for many centuries. The existing church is dedicated to St John, and is mostly built in the Perpendicular Gothic style. The timber roofs and octagonal stone font date from the 15th century, and the western church tower, with an embattled parapet, was probably rebuilt in the Tudor period. The church contains several 18th-century marble memorial tablets, the earliest dated 1704 to Sir Samuel Astry. The whole church was restored in 1866 by the firm of Pope & Bindon. Aust manor The estate at Aust was held from the Bishop of Worcester as part of the extensive feudal barony of Turstin FitzRolf who had acted as standard-bearer to William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. FitzRolf's properties in Gloucestershire were held in capite, including Aust, reverted to the Crown and then were granted to Wynebald de Ballon from Maine. Wynebald had a holding at Caerleon on the River Usk near the manor of his brother Hamelin de Ballon of Abergavenny. Both brothers made significant donations to the Abbey of St Vincent at Le Mans, including Wynebald's donation of the church of Aust. A daughter of de Ballon married a man named de Newmarch, their son Henry held the estate of Aust in 1166. John, his son and heir, next held Aust. One of John's daughters and co- heiress married Ralf Russell of Kingston Russell, who then held the estate. It passed in moiety through generations of the Russell and then Dennis families, through Margret Russell who married Sir Gilbert Denys (died 1422) to her grandson Walt Dennis. The moiety was purchased by the Astry family, The other moiety of Aust was held by Roger de Acton and was eventually sold to the Astry family. Reportedly it came into the Astry family in 1652. It was passed through several generations and was sold several times. In 1801 it was owned by Sacheverell Sitwell of Derbyshire. Services and facilities The village is within a short walking distance of 24hr shops at near-by Severn View services at Aust (originally known as Aust Services) is a small motorway service area operated by Moto on the M48 motorway near the Severn Bridge. There are also Burger King, and Costa Coffee located there. Severn View Services at MotorwayServices.info. Retrieved 14 July 2013 The main building is a two-storey timber and stone construction. The service area was listed as the last-known (February 1995) whereabouts of former Manic Street Preachers band member Richey Edwards, officially presumed deceased since 2008. The Severn Bridge, a suspension bridge opened as part of the M4 motorway (later renamed the M48) in 1966, crosses the Severn estuary between Aust and Beachley. It was the first Severn road crossing south of Gloucester, and took five years to construct at a cost of ¬£8 million. It replaced the Aust Ferry. The Aust Ferry passage across the Severn estuary between Aust and Beachley ‚Äì later known as the Old Passage ‚Äì was used from antiquity. In the 12th century, responsibility was granted to the monks of Tintern Abbey, and it continued to operate in subsequent centuries. From 1827, a regular steamboat ferry service was established, but it lost much of its trade when a rival service was set up downstream at New Passage in 1863, and when the Severn rail tunnel was opened in 1886. The growth of road traffic led to the re-establishment of a ferry between Aust and Beachley in 1926, carrying no more than 17 vehicles each time. Bob Dylan was photographed in 1966 standing outside the ferry ticket office, with the almost-completed Severn Bridge behind; the photo was used to publicise Martin Scorsese's film No Direction Home. The ferry service closed when the Severn Bridge was opened in September 1966.

It runs from junction 1 of the M48 at Aust to the docks at Avonmouth. After the Severn Bridge was opened in 1966, the A403 was constructed in 1969 and 1970 to provide a direct route between the M4 motorway and Avonmouth. It is an important route for the local industries, allowing easy access between Wales and this part of England. It was financed by Gloucestershire County Council with a ¬£387,000 grant from the Ministry of Transport and was initially known as the Avonmouth Aust Coast Road. Route A403 at Avonmouth The road is running through South Gloucestershire and the City of Bristol. Between the M4 at Aust and Pilning it replaced the B4055 on a realigned route. Between Pilning and Chittening it followed a new route beside the ICI Severnside plant, and from Chittening to Avonmouth it followed the route of an existing unclassified road, St Andrews Road. At Avonmouth it connects with the A4, leading to the Portway. The road disrupted local communities, with Pilning being split in two sections. It runs near the proposed Avonmouth and Severnside Enterprise Area, planned for expansion by Bristol City Council. Safety Around 8,000 vehicles a day use this road. Although this is relatively low, a high proportion of traffic consists of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs); over five times the average. The A403 has had a poor safety record with numerous accidents. A particular problem has been HGVs parked at laybys along the road obscuring the view ahead, leading to several fatalities. South Gloucestershire Council reduced the speed limit on their section to 50 mph in 2007. Bristol City Council have announced plans to install better facilities for cyclists along the road.

logo from a 1900 publication Routledge/Taylor & Francis at an American academic conference, 2008 Taylor & Francis at the University of London School of Advanced Study History Day, 2017 Taylor & Francis Group is an international company originating in England that publishes books and academic journals. It is a division of Informa plc, a United Kingdom-based publisher and conference company.About Us , Taylor & Francis, UK. Overview The company was founded in 1852 when William Francis joined Richard Taylor in his publishing business. Taylor had founded his company in 1798. Their subjects covered agriculture, chemistry, education, engineering, geography, law, mathematics, medicine, and social sciences. Francis's son, Richard Taunton Francis (1883‚Äì1930), was sole partner in the firm from 1917 to 1930. In 1965, Taylor & Francis launched Wykeham Publications and began book publishing. T&F; acquired Hemisphere Publishing in 1988, and the company was renamed Taylor & Francis Group to reflect the growing number of imprints. Taylor & Francis left the printing business in 1990, to concentrate on publishing. In 1998 it went public on the London Stock Exchange and in the same year bought its academic publishing rival Routledge for ¬£90 million. Acquisition of other publishers has remained a core part of the group's business strategy. It merged with Informa in 2004 to create a new company called T&F; Informa, since renamed back to Informa. Following the merger, T&F; closed the historic Routledge office at New Fetter Lane in London, and moved to its current headquarters in Milton Park, Oxfordshire. Taylor & Francis Group is now the academic publishing arm of Informa, and accounted for 30.2% of Group Revenue and 38.1% of Adjusted Profit in 2017. Taylor & Francis publishes more than 2,700 journals, and about 7,000 new books each year, with a backlist of over 140,000 titles available in print and digital formats. It uses the Routledge imprint for its publishing in humanities, social sciences, behavioural sciences, law and education, and the CRC Press imprint for its publishing in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In 2017, T&F; sold assets from its Garland Science imprint to W. W. Norton & Company and then ceased to use that brand. Although generally considered the smallest of the 'Big Four' STEM publishers (Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, and Taylor & Francis), its Routledge imprint is claimed to be the largest global academic publisher within humanities and social sciences. The company's journals have been delivered through the Taylor & Francis Online website since June 2011. Prior to that they were provided through the Informaworld website. Taylor & Francis ebooks are now available via the TaylorFrancis website. Taylor & Francis operates a number of Web services for its digital content including Routledge Handbooks Online, the Routledge Performance Archive, Secret Intelligence Files and Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism. Taylor & Francis offers Open Access publishing options in both its books and journals divisions and through its Cogent Open Access journals imprint. Taylor & Francis is a member of several professional publishing bodies including the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association, the International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers, the Association of Learned & Professional Society Publishers and The Publishers Association. In 2017, after collaborating for several years, T&F; bought specialist digital resources company Colwiz. In January 2020, T&F; bought open research publishing platform F1000. The old Taylor and Francis logo depicts a hand pouring oil into a lit lamp, along with the Latin phrase \\"alere flammam\\" - to feed the flame (of knowledge). The modern logo is a stylised oil lamp in a circle. Company figures The group has about 1,800 employees in at least 18 offices worldwide. Its head office is in Milton Park, Abingdon in the United Kingdom, with other offices in Stockholm, Leiden, New York, Boca Raton, Philadelphia, Kentucky, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Taipei, Melbourne, Sydney, Cape Town, Tokyo and New Delhi. Taylor & Francis reported a mean 2017 gender pay gap of 24.2% for its UK workforce, while the median was 8%. The fact that the average pay for women is significantly worse than the median pay (compared to men's) shows that women are underrepresented in the positions with the highest pay. Controversies Journal protests In 2013, the entire board of the Journal of Library Administration resigned in a dispute over author licensing agreements. Academic practices In 2016, Critical Reviews in Toxicology was accused by the Center for Public Integrity of being a \\"broker of junk science\\". Monsanto was found to have worked with an outside consulting firm to induce the journal to publish a biased review of the health effects of its product \\"Roundup\\". In 2017, Taylor & Francis was strongly criticized for getting rid of the editor-in-chief of International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health, who accepted articles critical of corporate interests. The company replaced the editor with a corporate consultant without consulting the editorial board. The journal Cogent Social Sciences accepted a hoax article, \\"The conceptual penis as a social construct\\", that had been rejected by another Taylor & Francis journal, Norma: International Journal for Masculinity Studies. When the authors announced the hoax, the article was retracted. In December 2018, the journal Dynamical Systems accepted the paper Saturation of Generalized Partially Hyperbolic Attractors only to have it retracted after publication due to the Iranian nationality of the authors. The European Mathematical Society condemned the retraction and later announced that Taylor & Francis had agreed to reverse the decision. Previous instances of Taylor & Francis journals discriminating against Iranian authors were reported in 2013. Manipulation of bibliometrics According to Goodhart's law and concerned academics like the signatories of the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment, commercial academic publishers benefit from manipulation of bibliometrics and scientometrics like the journal impact factor, which is often used as proxy of prestige and can influence revenues, including public subsidies in the form of subscriptions and free work from academics. Six T&F; journals, which exhibited unusual levels of self-citation, had their journal impact factor of 2019 suspended from Journal Citation Reports in 2020, a sanction which hit 34 journals in total.

There are fifteen major divisions at present, with eleven of them completely published, and one of them partially published. 56 volumes of the manga have been released as of August 2020. Pok√©mon Adventures: Red, Green & Blue  The first story shows Red, the protagonist, who gets his Pok√©dex from Professor Oak to start on his Pok√©mon journey, collecting Pok√©mon and battling gym leaders for the eight coveted gym badges. He later meets his rival Blue (Green in Japanese) who, oddly enough, is Oak's own grandson. Later in his journey, he encounters con artist Green (Blue in Japanese), who sells him fake Pok√©mon items. She has stolen a Squirtle from Oak‚Äôs lab and has evolved it into a Wartortle. Later, Oak had been kidnapped by Team Rocket to create a Mewtwo, and Red, Green and Blue arrive at Saffron City to take on the Team Rocket Admins‚ÄîKoga, Lt. Surge, and Sabrina. They manage to defeat Team Rocket and save Oak. Red then travels to the Indigo Plateau to battle his rival Blue, having gained seven badges, but also prevails against the evil bio-weapon Mewtwo and Team Rocket's leader and legendary missing Viridian Gym Leader, Giovanni, on the way. Green is confronted by Oak about stealing and is forgiven. Red later battles Blue in the Pok√©mon League Championships and emerges victorious, claiming the title of champion of the Pok√©mon League. Pok√©mon Adventures: Yellow  In contrast to the first story, this chapter is more graphic and has more original plots, which will be carried onto further storylines. Red has disappeared after receiving a challenge letter sent to him by Bruno of the Elite Four. They plan to lure him to them, and use him to get information on Giovanni‚Äôs whereabouts. They also need his Earth Badge. Only Red‚Äôs Pikachu, Pika, managed to escape, Red having been encased in ice. Yellow decided to go look for Red, as Red had helped her catch a Rattata to train her in the skills of battling. Later, Yellow, Blaine, Blue, Green, Bill, Lt. Surge, Koga and Sabrina join forces to bring down the Elite Four together. They find out that Lance‚Äôs master plan was to use the Gym Badges and create an amplifying effect at Cerise Island to power up a mysterious Legendary Pok√©mon and destroy all humans in the world except themselves. They felt that humans and Pok√©mon were not meant to coexist. Red turned up later at Cerise Island to help Surge and Bill defeat Bruno. It is also revealed that Giovanni was the one who rescued Red from his ice coffin. Yellow battles Lance, but is losing until the other trainers send their power to Yellow, and with their combined strength, she manages to defeat Lance. Pok√©mon Adventures: Gold, Silver & Crystal  The third adventure is based on the Pok√©mon Gold, Silver, and Crystal versions of the game. It features the protagonists Gold, Silver and Crystal, and is centered mostly around the Johto region, with Gold as the point of view character. Gold first started his journey to chase a thief that broke into Professor Elm's lab, and stole a Totodile. Gold then made it his mission to get Totodile back from Silver (who stole it), and follows Silver. In Gold's quest to steal back Totodile, he decided to become fully involved in Silver's life. But following him gets him wrapped up in Neo Team Rocket (a revival of Team Rocket), and Gold tries to stop them. In a shocking reveal, it turns out one of the gym leaders is the Neo Team Rocket's leader, the Ice type gym leader, Pryce. He was also the Mask of Ice, a mysterious man who kidnapped Silver and Green as children. The Johto Trio (Gold, Silver, and a pro catcher named Crystal) then stop both Neo Rocket and the Mask of Ice in a dramatic final battle to end off the chapter. Pok√©mon Adventures: Ruby & Sapphire  The Ruby & Sapphire manga is based on the Ruby and Sapphire versions of the game. It features Ruby and Sapphire and their bet to each other: 80 days for Ruby to win all the Contest Ribbons in Hoenn, and for Sapphire, a powerful trainer in her own right, to battle all the Gym Leaders for the 8 badges. In their travels, they meet new companions like the gym leaders of the Hoenn region and the avid news reporter Gabby and her cameraman Ty (who play a minor role in the games). Team Aqua and Team Magma are introduced here, as they attempt to awaken the legendary Pok√©mon Kyogre and Groudon to conquer the world, and Ruby and Sapphire take notice after encountering several main members in their journeys. The gym leaders, Ruby, and Sapphire end up trying to protect Hoenn from the awakened Kyogre and Groudon. In the chapter Rayquaza Redemption II, Sapphire confesses that she has developed feelings for Ruby. Pok√©mon Adventures: FireRed & LeafGreen  The next story, returning to Red, Green, and Blue, is loosely based on the Sevii Islands portion of the FireRed and LeafGreen versions of the game. The plot consists of Team Rocket trying to capture Deoxys, and Red, Green and Blue‚Äôs efforts to stop them. Along the way, they must rescue Green's parents and Professor Oak, who is Blue's grandfather, who have been kidnapped by Deoxys. Despite their best efforts, they are not able to stop Team Rocket from obtaining Deoxys, even though they mastered the ultimate attacks taught by Ultima, an old but powerful woman residing on Two Island. Yellow and Silver are introduced into the plot halfway when they later tried to find his parents. Knowing that his object was somewhere in Viridian City, he met up with Yellow in the forest understanding and she tried to help him find them. Giovanni had used Deoxys's power to search for his lost son and was led to the forest when Silver and Yellow were in. It is revealed that Silver was Giovanni's son and he passed out in shock. Yellow followed Team Rocket, who brought Silver back with them to an airship. Giovanni was challenged by Red after he went after him alone when Blue and Green stayed behind at the Sevii Islands before he could meet his son. He lost, but the airship went out of control. Together, Red, Blue, Green, Yellow as well as Silver stop it from destroying cities and populations but they were caught in an energy clash that petrified them. Though Mewtwo was also caught in the attack, his body is nowhere to be seen. Deoxys had managed to escape moments before the blast currently searching for his friend (who is also a Deoxys). Pok√©mon Adventures: Emerald  This story is based on the Emerald version of the game, specifically the Battle Frontier portion. The main protagonist of this story arc is Emerald, who is hired by Crystal and Professor Oak to capture Jirachi in seven days before it is captured by Guile Hideout, the main antagonist. Emerald is also trying to challenge the seven facilities of Battle Frontier and conquer them all. In the process, Emerald meets with the other two Hoenn Pok√©dex holders, Ruby and Sapphire. The three Pok√©dex owners take on the Battle Frontier challenge, but they are interrupted by Guile Hideout, who was manipulating the head of the Battle Tower, Anabel. In an ensuing battle with Emerald, he releases Anabel from his control and reveals himself to be Team Aqua's leader, Archie. He also reveals that he has caught Jirachi, and subsequently uses it to summon a massive water-composed clone of Kyogre to flood the Battle Frontier. Archie hinted, however, that he was unable to be separated from the armor covering him for a prolonged period of time. The three Pok√©dex holders escape the rising waters with the help of Gold and Crystal, who had also arrived at the Battle Frontier. Gold explains that the five Pok√©dex owners who were petrified ‚Äî Red, Blue, Green, Yellow and Silver ‚Äî were ordered to be shipped to the Battle Frontier. The hope was for them to be de-petrified through a wish to Jirachi. While Crystal trains Ruby and Sapphire to learn a powerful skill that can help stop the Kyogre, Archie abandons Jirachi, who was subsequently left in Emerald's hands. Gold assigns Emerald to make a wish to de-petrify Red, Blue, Green, Yellow and Silver. After finally coming into terms with his real desire‚Äîto be with Pok√©mon and people who like them‚ÄîJirachi grants his wish, and the five Pok√©dex owners were cured of their petrification. Red and Gold immediately incapacitated Archie by destroying his armor. With all ten Pok√©dex owners now reunited, they combined their strongest attacks together and defeated the Kyogre. Archie then vanishes as a result of him being separated from his armor for too long. Pok√©mon Adventures: Diamond & Pearl  This storyline is based on the Diamond and Pearl versions of the game. It features Lady Platinum Berlitz, who, for her coming-of-age ceremony, must travel to the top of Mt. Coronet in order to collect materials to create her own family emblem.

Three years after the events in the Emerald arc, the story starts when Gold arrives in the Pok√©athlon Dome, looking for a person with information he is supposed to meet with.

Development Series writer Hidenori Kusaka was offered to make a Pok√©mon manga by Nintendo. Having been a fan of manga ever since he was a child, Kusaka quickly accepted. When writing the series, Kusaka always tries to add elements of amazements with the idea that the readers would feel they are actually playing a video game. Some parts from the story are based on Kusaka's thoughts of the Pok√©mon video games, which includes weapon designs and the areas where wild Pok√©mon live. His main focus in manga is to create Pok√©mon that looks attractive so that readers would appreciate them more. He also tries to balance the number of Pok√©mon trainers and Pok√©mon in order to be faithful to the game. During publication of the series, artist Mato fell sick leaving Kusaka to either cancel the series or select another artist. He decided to continue and chose Satoshi Yamamoto as Mato's replacement. Yamamoto felt pressure during his debut as older fans criticized his art in comparison to Mato. When he started drawing he had little knowledge about Pok√©mon, but still he was focused in the drawing for the new protagonist, Crystal. After working for a year, he was surprised with Kusaka's stories and wanted to make his pictures give a good impression. During the fourth story arc, Yamamoto mentioned that several of the disasters happening in the Hoenn region that he drew are based on his favorite horror and monster movies. Reception Japanese volumes from the series have been featured in the Japanese comic ranking various times. Viz's first volumes edition from the manga, \\"The Best of Pok√©mon Adventures\\", appeared on ICv2's Top 20 Graphic Novels from April 2008. It also won the first Nickelodeon Magazine Comics Awards in the category \\"Favorite Manga Series\\". Readers from Media Factory's Da Vinci Denshi Navi magazine voted the series as the third manga they wanted to have an animated adaptation. ICv2's Nick Smith gave the first volume 3.5 stars out of 5, commenting that several of the parts from the manga make it more interesting than the anime, such as Team Rocket's appearances or Pikachu's rebelled personality. Although he still noted there was more violence in the manga than in the anime, he still recommended it for all ages. A similar opinion was given by Active Anime's Scott Campbell who liked how different Red's character was from Ash Ketchum due to their differences in personality and abilities, making the former character seem more interesting for the readers. The artwork was described as \\"fairly cutesy and fun, but still of a very high quality\\" while fights received positive responses due to the Pok√©mon's movements. Volume 14 charted at number 10 on The New York Times Manga Best Seller list on the week ending August 6, 2011. Tsunekazu Ishihara, CEO of The Pok√©mon Company, said \\"I want every Pok√©mon fan to read this comic!\\"  Notes  References External links *Pocket Monsters Special Japanese website *Official Pok√©mon Adventures website of Viz Media * Category:1997 manga Category:Adventure anime and manga Category:Children's manga Category:Fantasy anime and manga Category:Pok√©mon manga Category:Sh≈çnen manga Category:Shogakukan manga Category:Viz Media manga ","title":"Pok√©mon Adventures"},{"id":"558562","text":"Wylie is an English name meaning \\"wealthy person\\", and may also refer to: People * Wylie (surname) * Wylie (Australian explorer), Aboriginal companion of Edward John Eyre during his crossing of the Nullarbor Plain in Australia * Wylie Breckenridge (1903‚Äì1991), rugby union player who represented Australia * Wylie Gibbs (born 1922), Australian politician * Wylie Cameron Grant (1879‚Äì1968), American tennis champion * Wylie Human (born 1979), South African rugby union winger * Wylie Stateman, American supervising sound editor * Wylie Sypher (1905‚Äì1987), American non-fiction writer and professor * Wylie Watson (1889‚Äì1966), British actor * Wylie G.

In the late 20th century the town reverted to the more widely known English version of its name, Kells, and dropped M√≥r from the Irish version of the name. is a town in County Meath, Ireland. The town lies off the M3 motorway, from Navan and from Dublin. It is best known as the site of Kells Abbey, from which the Book of Kells takes its name. Name The settlement was originally known by the Irish name Ceannanas or Ceannanus, and it is suggested that the name 'Kells' developed from this.Placenames Database of Ireland (see archival records) From the 12th century onward, the settlement was referred to in English and Anglo-Norman as Kenenus, Kenelles, Kenles, Kenlis, Kellis and finally Kells. It has also been suggested that Kenlis and Kells come from an alternative Irish name, Ceann Lios, meaning \\"[the] head fort\\". Kells, Kenlis and Headfort all feature in the titles taken by the Taylor family. In 1929, Ceannanus M√≥r was made the town's official name in both Irish and English. Following the creation of the Irish Free State, a number of towns were renamed likewise. Ceanannas has been the official Irish- language form of the place name since 1969.Logainm placenames database of Ireland (in Irish) In 1993, Kells was re-adopted as the town's official name in English.S.I. No. 156/1993 - Local Government (Change of Name of Urban District) Order, 1993. Irish Statute Book. History Folio 34r of the Book of Kells is illustrated with the Chi Rho monogram Before Kells was a monastery, it was the site of a royal site inhabited by the High King Cormac mac Airt who moved his residence from the Hill of Tara, for reasons scholars are not yet sure about. Kells was an important place on one of the five ancient roads that came out of Tara - this road being named Sl√≠ nan nAssail and which ran from Tara to Rathcrogan, another royal site, in County Roscommon. About 560 AD, Colmcille (later known as Columba) a prince of the royal house of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill family acquired Kells in recompense of a fault acted against him by his cousin the High King Diarmuid MacCarroll, who granted him the D√∫n of Ceannanus to establish a Monastery. The present monastery at Kells is thought to have been founded around 804 AD by monks from St Colmcille's monastery in Iona who were fleeing Viking invasions. In 1152, the Synod of Kells completed the transition of the Colmcille's establishment from a monastic church to a diocesan church. A later synod reduced the status of Kells to that of a parish. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland, Hugh de Lacy was granted the Lordship of Meath in 1182. The religious establishments at Kells continued to flourish under their Anglo-Norman overlords. Kells became a border town garrison of the Pale and was the scene of many battles between the Kingdom of Breifne and the Hiberno-Normans (who had heavily intermarried). From 1561 to 1800, Kells returned two MPs to the Parliament of Ireland. During the Irish rebellion of 1641, Kells was burned by the O'Reilly clan during their attacks on the Pale. The period of the Great Famine saw the population of Kells drop by 38% as measured by the census records of 1841 and 1851. The Workhouse and the Fever Hospital were described as full to overflowing. Places of interest *The Kells Monastic Site, with its round tower, is associated with St Colmcille (also known as Columba), the Book of Kells, now kept at Trinity College Dublin and the Kells Crozier, exhibited at the British Museum. The round tower and five large Celtic crosses can still be viewed today. Four of the crosses are in the churchyard of St Columba's church. The other Celtic cross was positioned in the middle of a busy crossroads until an accident involving a school bus. It now stands in front of a former courthouse. A roof protects the cross from the elements. Curiously, a replica is completely safe from the elements inside the museum. Kells Kells Round Tower dates from the 10th century *Close by the graveyard of St. Columba's church stands a small stone roofed Oratory (St. Colmcille's House). This probably dates from the 11th century. Access to the monks' sleeping accommodation aloft is by ladder. This small rectangular building is positioned at one of the highest points in the town. The Oratory is kept locked, but visitor access can be arranged. *Just outside the town of Kells on the road to Oldcastle is the hill of Lloyd, named after Thomas Lloyd of Enniskillen, who camped a large Williamite army here during the wars of 1688-91 against the Jacobites. Here also stands a 30m high building called the Spire of Lloyd, which is an 18th-century lighthouse folly, the area around the tower has been developed as a community park (The People's Park), and includes the Paupers' Grave. This cemetery was a necessity in the times of great poverty in the country. Mass is still celebrated there annually and the cemetery is a reminder of the Workhouse and extreme poverty engendered by changes in farming practice in the 19th century and during the Famine. Population The population of Kells town (according to the official 2016 Census of Population) was 6,135. This represents a slight increase in population over the 2011 Census. There was a 22% increase in total population between 1996 and 2002. Transport Roads Until the opening of the new motorway in June 2010, Kells stood as a busy junction town on the old N3 road with over 18,000 vehicles passing through the town each day. Kells was a renowned traffic bottleneck from both the N3 national primary route (Dublin, Cavan, Enniskillen and Ballyshannon) and N52 national secondary route (Dundalk, Tullamore and Nenagh) passing through the town centre. The new M3 motorway (opened June 2010) significantly reduces the journey time to Dublin, as well as the numbers of vehicles in the town. Bus Kells is served by a regular bus service run by Bus √âireann, the 109, 109A and 109X, which takes about 1.5 hours to Bus√°ras in Dublin. Railway The original Kells railway station, serving a line between Oldcastle and Drogheda via Navan, opened on 11 July 1853. It was closed for passenger traffic on 14 April 1958 and finally for all traffic on 1 April 1963. \\"Meath on Track\\" are seeking reinstatement of the Navan railway link, and on to Dublin. It is estimated that a Kells to Dublin City Centre rail service would take approximately 60 minutes depending on stops.

She fought primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic. After the war she was sold to the Venezuelan Navy. She was named after Oakville, Ontario. Background Flower-class corvettes like Oakville serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction and career Oakville was laid down by Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co. at Port Arthur on 21 December 1940 and was launched on 21 June 1941. She was commissioned into the RCN on 18 November 1941. Attempted capture and sinking of U-94 left On 28 August 1942, in the company of American warships and the corvettes and , Oakville was escorting a convoy off Ha√Øti when she attacked . The submarine, which had been on the point of attacking the convoy, was first spotted and bombarded by an American seaplane. Oakville dropped depth charges to force it to surface, and after bombarding it, rammed the submarine twice. The submarine, struck by a depth charge on the surface, gave up the fight. A boarding party was dispatched to seize the vessel. Eleven sailors, under the command of Commander Clarence King, including Sub Lieutenant Hal Lawrence, and Petty Officer A.J. Powell, leapt onto the deck of the crippled U-94 and rushed toward the conning tower, which was riddled by shellfire. After clearing away the dead bodies covering the hatchway, Lawrence and Powell headed below. They were then surprised by two Germans who emerged from an escape hatch. After ordering them back inside, the Canadians opened fire on the two men, who were dashing toward them. The German crew, in a panic at the thought that the U-boat could sink at any moment, surrendered quickly. Despite the danger, Lawrence went searching for the Enigma machine and documents. But finding that U-94 had been scuttled, he retraced his steps, having to swim to the ladder which led to the conning tower. After giving the order to abandon ship, Lawrence leapt into the water just before the submarine went down. The Allied sailors and the 19 German survivors were recovered by Oakville and the American destroyer . Post-war service Oakville was paid off from the RCN and decommissioned on 20 July 1945. She was sold in 1946 to Venezuela as Patria. The ship's bell disappeared prior to the sale and remains missing.

He is credited with demonstrating that the Celtic languages belong to the Indo-European group. Life Zeuss was born in Kronach, Upper Franconia, and studied at the gymnasium of Bamberg. His parents wished him to enter the priesthood, but he chose a scholarly career, inclining particularly to historical and linguistic studies. He entered the University of Munich and after graduating, taught at the gymnasium there. In 1837 his book Die Herkunft der Baiern von den Markomannen (The Descent of the Bavarians from the Markomans), which brought him an honorary PhD from the University of Erlangen. The same year he went to Speyer to teach history at the lyceum and remained there until 1847, when he accepted a professorship of history at the University of Munich. This he resigned on account of poor health and was transferred to the lyceum in Bamberg. In 1853 there appeared his monumental Grammatica Celtica, which brought him fame. Two years after he took leave of absence to recover his health, but he died in Kronach the following year.  Influence  Statue of Zeuss in Kronach. Zeuss was a scholar of great erudition, combining a knowledge of philology with history and ethnology. His Germanic studies had taught him the necessity of knowing Celtic languages, and he went to work to investigate this neglected field. To get at the sources, the old manuscripts, particularly those in Old Irish, he journeyed to Karlsruhe, W√ºrzburg, St. Gallen, Milan, London, and Oxford, and everywhere made extracts or copies. Both ancient and modern dialects received his attention. His Grammatica Celtica proved beyond doubt that the Celtic languages were a group of the Indo-European family, which put Celtic philology on a sound scientific basis. After the author's death the work was revised and re-edited by Hermann Ebel (Berlin, 1871). Other works by Zeuss are Traditiones possessionesque Wirzenburgenses (1842) and Die Freie Reichstadt Speyer vor ihrer Zerst√∂rung (The Free Imperial City of Speyer before its Destruction). De Barra (2018, page 26) writes that Zeuss \\"brought rigorous scientific methodologies and a sense of scholarly gravitas to the study of indigenous languages of Britain and Ireland....something the field had lacked before....in his wake universities in Britain and Europe devoted more resources to the study of Celtic matters\\".

Zhelev was one of the most prominent figures of the 1989 Bulgarian Revolution, which ended the 33 year rule of President Todor Zhivkov. A member of the Union of Democratic Forces, he was elected as President by the 7th Grand National Assembly. Two years later, he won Bulgaria's first direct presidential elections. He lost his party's nomination for his 1996 reelection campaign after losing a tough primary race to Petar Stoyanov.  Biography  Early life Zhelyu Zhelev was born on 3 March 1935 in Veselinovo village, Shumen. He graduated with a degree in philosophy from the Sofia University \\"St. Kliment Ohridski\\" in 1958, and later earned a Ph.D. in 1974.  Dissident  Zhelev was a member of the Bulgarian Communist Party, but was expelled from it for political reasons in 1965. He was unemployed for six years since all employment in Bulgaria was state- regulated. In 1982, he published his controversial work, \\"The Fascism\\" (–§–∞—à–∏–∑–º—ä—Ç). Three weeks after the volume's publication in 1982, the book was removed from bookstores and libraries throughout the nation, as its description of the fascist states of Italy, Germany and Spain before, during, and after World War II made these regimes comparable to the Communist regimes in the Eastern block.  SDS  In 1988, just before the Fall of Communism, Zhelev founded the Ruse Committee, and in 1989 he became a founding member and chairman of the Club for Support of Openness and the Reform (a time when many such democratic clubs were formed), which helped him to achieve the position of Chairman of the Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgarian: –°–î–°, SDS) party.Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces. Demokratsiya Newspaper, 27 April 1990.  MP and President  Zhelev was elected MP in June 1990 for the 7th Grand National Assembly; the Assembly's main goal was to create a new democratic Constitution of Bulgaria. After the resignation of President Petar Mladenov, the assembly elected Zhelev his successor on 1 August 1990. He thus became the first head of state in 44 years who was not either a Communist or fellow traveler.  1992 presidential election  Under the new constitution adopted in July 1991, the president was to be elected directly by voters, for a maximum of two terms. The first such election was held in January 1992. Zhelev won in the runoff against Velko Valkanov (who was endorsed by the Socialists) with 52.8% of the votes to become Bulgaria's first directly elected head of state. He immediately suspended his membership in the UDF; the new constitution did not allow the president to be a formal member of a political party during his term.  1996 presidential election  Zhelev sought a second term in 1996, but lost the UDF nomination to eventual winner Petar Stoyanov.  Later political career  After his defeat in the 1996 UDF primaries and after the end of his presidency in 1997, Zhelev remained in politics, but on a much smaller scale. He became Honorary Chair of the Liberal Democratic Union and Honorary Chair of the Liberal International and in 1997 went on to establish and preside over a foundation named after him. Zhelev was the initiator and president of the Balkan Political Club, a union of former political leaders from Southeast Europe. As part of the club he voiced his support for Turkey's accession to the European Union. In 2009, Zhelev also voiced his opinion that Bulgaria should adopt a presidential system based upon the French model: \\"The country should have both prime minister and president, but the latter should be vested in far-reaching powers so that he may control the executive power\\". Zhelev died in Sofia at the age of 79 on 30 January 2015. World Justice Project Zhelyu Zhelev served as an Honorary Co-Chair for the World Justice Project (ABA).

He was Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 7 January 1929 until 4 April 1932. He was one of the most prominent participants in the 1903 coup and assassination of King Aleksandar Obrenoviƒá and Queen Draga. Life Petar ≈Ωivkoviƒá was born in Negotin, Principality of Serbia (present-day Bor District, Serbia) in 1879. He finished secondary school in Zajecar and the Military Academy in Belgrade. A soldier at the Serbian court, he helped overthrow the Obrenoviƒá dynasty with the assassination of King Alexander I of Serbia (11 June), which was orchestrated by Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijeviƒá, the founder and leading member of the secret nationalist organization Black Hand. ≈Ωivkoviƒá later founded the secret organization White Hand in 1912, which served to counter the power of the Black Hand. In 1921, King Alexander I of Yugoslavia appointed ≈Ωivkoviƒá commander of the Royal Guard, but he was briefly demoted due to accusations by a young guardsman that he tried to seduce him.In this reference in Serbian on Vesti Online In 1929 he was appointed Prime Minister as part of the 6 January Dictatorship. General ≈Ωivkoviƒá was Bogoljub Jevtiƒá's brother-in-law, the closest adviser to the head of State. ≈Ωivkoviƒá held the office as a member of the Yugoslav Radical Peasants' Democracy (JRSD), which became the only legal party in Yugoslavia, following electoral reforms. He resigned as prime minister in 1932, and shortly thereafter founded the Yugoslav National Party (JNS), becoming its president in 1936. Following Alexander I assassination in 1934, His cousin Pavle Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá took office as regent for the 11-year-old Petar II. Upon Pavle's 1941 signing of the Tripartite Pact, ≈Ωivkoviƒá left Yugoslavia ahead of the Nazi invasion. He became part of the Yugoslav government in exile. In 1946 he was tried in absentia in Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and sentenced to death by the communist authorities. He remained in exile in France, dying in Paris in 1947, aged 68.

It is named after Archibald Denis Leigh, a British neuropsychiatrist who first described the condition in 1951. Normal levels of thiamine, thiamine monophosphate, and thiamine diphosphate are commonly found but there is a reduced or absent level of thiamine triphosphate. This is thought to be caused by a blockage in the enzyme thiamine-diphosphate kinase, and therefore treatment in some patients would be to take thiamine triphosphate daily. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of Leigh syndrome are classically described as beginning in infancy and leading to death within a span of several years; however, as more cases are recognized, it is apparent that symptoms can emerge at any age‚Äîincluding adolescence or adulthood‚Äîand patients can survive for many years following diagnosis. Symptoms are often first seen after a triggering event that taxes the body's energy production, such as an infection or surgery. The general course of Leigh syndrome is one of episodic developmental regression during times of metabolic stress. Some patients have long periods without disease progression while others develop progressive decline. Infants with the syndrome have symptoms that include diarrhea, vomiting, and dysphagia (trouble swallowing or sucking), leading to a failure to thrive. Children with early Leigh disease also may appear irritable and cry much more than healthy babies. Seizures are often seen. Excess lactate may be seen in the urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood of a person with Leigh syndrome. As the disease progresses, the muscular system is debilitated throughout the body, as the brain cannot control the contraction of muscles. Hypotonia (low muscle tone and strength), dystonia (involuntary, sustained muscle contraction), and ataxia (lack of control over movement) are often seen in people with Leigh disease. The eyes are particularly affected; the muscles that control the eyes become weak, paralyzed, or uncontrollable in conditions called ophthalmoparesis (weakness or paralysis) and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements). Slow saccades are also sometimes seen. The heart and lungs can also fail as a result of Leigh disease. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (thickening of part of the heart muscle) is also sometimes found and can cause death; asymmetric septal hypertrophy has also been associated with Leigh syndrome. In children with Leigh-syndrome associated ventricular septal defects, caused by pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, high forehead and large ears are seen; facial abnormalities are not typical of Leigh syndrome. However, respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people with Leigh syndrome. Other neurological symptoms include peripheral neuropathy, loss of sensation in extremities caused by damage to the peripheral nervous system. Hypertrichosis is seen in Leigh syndrome caused by mutations in the nuclear gene SURF1. Genomics Two healthy mitochondria from mammalian lung tissue as shown by electron microscopy Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and over 30 genes in nuclear DNA (gene SURF1 and some COX assembly factors) have been implicated in Leigh disease. Disorders of oxidative phosphorylation, the process by which cells produce their main energy source of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), may be caused by mutations in either mtDNA or in nuclear encoded genes. The latter account for the majority of Leigh disease, although it is not always possible to identify the specific mutation responsible for the condition in a particular individual. Four out of the five protein complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are most commonly disrupted in Leigh syndrome, either because of malformed protein or because of an error in the assembly of these complexes. Regardless of the genetic basis, it results in an inability of the complexes affected by the mutation to perform their role in oxidative phosphorylation. In the case of Leigh disease, crucial cells in the brain stem and basal ganglia are affected. This causes a chronic lack of energy in the cells, which leads to cell death and in turn, affects the central nervous system and inhibits motor functions. The heart and other muscles also require a lot of energy and are affected by cell death caused by chronic energy deficiencies in Leigh syndrome. Mitochondrial DNA mutations Mitochondria are essential organelles in eukaryotic cells. Their function is to convert the potential energy of glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in a process called oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria carry their own DNA, called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The information stored in the mtDNA is used to produce several of the enzymes essential to the production of ATP. Between 20 and 25 percent of Leigh syndrome cases are caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. The most common of these mutations is found in 10 to 20 percent of Leigh syndrome and occurs in MT-ATP6, a gene that codes for a protein in the last complex of the oxidative phosphorylation chain, ATP synthase, an enzyme that directly generates ATP. Without ATP synthase, the electron transport chain will not produce any ATP. The most common MT-ATP6 mutation found with Leigh syndrome is a point mutation at nucleotide 8993 that changes a thymine to a guanine. This and other point mutations associated with Leigh syndrome destabilize or malform the protein complex and keep energy production down in affected cells. Several mitochondrial genes involved in creating the first complex of the oxidative phosphorylation chain can be implicated in a case of Leigh syndrome, including genes MT-ND2, MT-ND3, MT- ND5, MT-ND6 and MT-CO1. Mitochondrial DNA is passed down matrilineally in a pattern called maternal inheritance ‚Äî a mother can transmit the genes for Leigh syndrome to both male and female children, but fathers cannot pass down mitochondrial genes. Nuclear DNA mutations The autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance seen in some cases of Leigh syndrome Nuclear DNA comprises most of the genome of an organism and in sexually reproducing organisms is inherited from both parents, in contrast to mitochondrial DNA's maternal pattern of inheritance. Leigh syndrome caused by nuclear DNA mutations is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that two copies of the mutated gene are required to cause the disease, so two unaffected parents, each of whom carries one mutant allele, can have an affected child if that child inherits the mutant allele from both parents. 75 to 80 percent of Leigh syndrome is caused by mutations in nuclear DNA; mutations affecting the function or assembly of the fourth complex involved in oxidative phosphorylation, cytochrome c oxidase (COX), cause most cases of Leigh disease. Mutations in a gene called SURF1 (surfeit1) are the most common cause of this subtype of Leigh syndrome. The protein that SURF1 codes for is terminated early and therefore cannot perform its function, shepherding the subunits of COX together into a functional protein complex. This results in a deficit of COX protein, reducing the amount of energy produced by mitochondria. SURF1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 9. Another nuclear DNA mutation that causes Leigh syndrome affects another protein complex in the mitochondria, pyruvate dehydrogenase, which is an enzyme in the Link reaction pathway. Some types of SURF1 mutations cause a subtype of Leigh syndrome that has a particularly late onset but similarly variable clinical course. Other nuclear genes associated with Leigh syndrome are located on chromosome 2 (BCS1L and NDUFA10); chromosome 5 (SDHA, NDUFS4, NDUFAF2, and NDUFA2); chromosome 8 (NDUFAF6), chromosome 10 (COX15); chromosome 11 (NDUFS3, NDUFS8, and FOXRED1); chromosome 12 (NDUFA9 and NDUFA12); and chromosome 19 (NDUFS7). Many of these genes affect the first oxidative phosphorylation complex. X-linked Leigh syndrome The X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance seen occasionally in cases of Leigh syndrome. Leigh syndrome can also be caused by deficiency of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), most commonly involving a PDHC subunit which is encoded by an X-linked gene (OMIM 308930). The neurological features of Leigh syndrome caused by PDHC deficiency are indistinguishable from other forms. However, non-neurological features (other than lactic acidosis) are not seen in PDHC deficiency. X-linked recessive Leigh syndrome affects male children far more often than female children because they only have one copy of the X chromosome. Female children would need two copies of the faulty gene to be affected by X-linked Leigh syndrome. French Canadian Leigh syndrome The type of Leigh syndrome found at a much higher rate in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec is caused by a mutation in the LRPPRC gene, located on the small ('p') arm of chromosome 2. Both compound heterozygosity and homozygous mutations have been observed in French Canadian Leigh syndrome. This subtype of the disease was first described in 1993 in 34 children from the region, all of whom had a severe deficiency in cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the fourth complex in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Though the subunits of the protein found in affected cells were functional, they were not properly assembled. The deficiency was found to be almost complete in brain and liver tissues and substantial (approximately 50% of normal enzyme activity) in fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) and skeletal muscle. Kidney and heart tissues were found to not have a COX deficiency. French Canadian Leigh syndrome has similar symptoms to other types of Leigh syndrome. The age of onset is, on average, 5 months and the median age of death is 1 year and 7 months. Children with the disease are developmentally delayed, have mildly dysmorphic facial features, including hypoplasia of the midface and wide nasal bridge, chronic metabolic acidosis, and hypotonia (decreased muscular strength). Other symptoms include tachypnea (unusually quick breathing rate), poor sucking ability, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), and tremors. Severe, sudden metabolic acidosis is a common cause of mortality. Estimates of the rate of genetic carriers in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region range from 1 in 23 to 1 in 28; the number of children born with the disease has been estimated at 1 in 2063 to 1 in 2473 live births. Genealogic studies suggest that the responsible mutation was introduced to the region by early European settlers. Pathophysiology The characteristic symptoms of Leigh syndrome are at least partially caused by bilateral, focal lesions in the brainstem, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and other regions of the brain. The lesions take on different forms, including areas of demyelination, spongiosis, gliosis, necrosis, and capillary proliferation. Demyelination is the loss of the myelin sheath around the axons of neurons, inhibiting their ability to communicate with other neurons. The brain stem is involved in maintaining basic life functions such as breathing, swallowing, and circulation; the basal ganglia and cerebellum control movement and balance. Damage to these areas therefore results in the major symptoms of Leigh syndrome‚Äîloss of control over functions controlled by these areas. The lactic acidosis sometimes associated with Leigh syndrome is caused by the buildup of pyruvate, which is unable to be processed in individuals with certain types of oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies. The pyruvate is either converted into alanine via alanine aminotransferase or converted into lactic acid by lactate dehydrogenase; both of these substances can then build up in the body. Diagnosis Leigh syndrome is suggested by clinical findings and confirmed with laboratory and genetic testing. Clinical findings Dystonia, nystagmus, and problems with the autonomic nervous system suggest damage to the basal ganglia and brain stem potentially caused by Leigh syndrome. Other symptoms are also indicative of brain damage, such as hypertrichosis and neurologically caused deafness. Laboratory findings of lactic acidosis or acidemia and hyperalaninemia (elevated levels of alanine in the blood) can also suggest Leigh syndrome. Assessing the level of organic acids in urine can also indicate a dysfunction in the metabolic pathway. Differential diagnosis Other diseases can have a similar clinical presentation to Leigh syndrome; excluding other causes of similar clinical symptoms is often a first step to diagnosing Leigh syndrome. Conditions that can appear similar to Leigh disease include perinatal asphyxia, kernicterus, carbon monoxide poisoning, methanol toxicity, thiamine deficiency, Wilson's disease, biotin-responsive basal ganglia disease, and some forms of encephalitis. Perinatal asphyxia can cause bilateral ganglial lesions and damage to the thalamus, which are similar to the signs seen with Leigh syndrome. When hyperbilirubinemia is not treated with phototherapy, the bilirubin can accumulate in the basal ganglia and cause lesions similar to those seen in Leigh syndrome. This is not common since the advent of phototherapy. Treatment Succinic acid has been studied, and shown effective for both Leigh syndrome, and MELAS syndrome. A high-fat, low- carbohydrate diet may be followed if a gene on the X chromosome is implicated in an individual's Leigh syndrome. Thiamine (vitamin B1) may be given if pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is known or suspected. The symptoms of lactic acidosis are treated by supplementing the diet with sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or sodium citrate, but these substances do not treat the cause of Leigh syndrome. Dichloroacetate may also be effective in treating Leigh syndrome-associated lactic acidosis; research is ongoing on this substance. Coenzyme Q10 supplements have been seen to improve symptoms in some cases. Clinical trials of the drug EPI-743 for Leigh syndrome are ongoing. In 2016, John Zhang and his team at New Hope Fertility Center in New York, USA, performed a spindle transfer mitochondrial donation technique on a mother in Mexico who was at risk of producing a baby with Leigh disease. A healthy boy was born on 6 April 2016. However, it is not yet certain if the technique is completely reliable and safe.  Prognosis  Different genetic causes and types of Leigh syndrome have different prognoses, though all are poor. The most severe forms of the disease, caused by a full deficiency in one of the affected proteins, cause death at a few years of age. If the deficiency is not complete, the prognosis is somewhat better and an affected child is expected to survive 6‚Äì7 years, and in rare cases, to their teenage years. Epidemiology Leigh syndrome occurs in at least 1 of 40,000 live births, though certain populations have much higher rates. In the Saguenay-Lac-Saint- Jean region of central Quebec, Leigh syndrome occurs at a rate of 1 in 2000 newborns. History Leigh syndrome was first described by Denis Leigh in 1951 and distinguished from similar Wernicke's encephalopathy in 1954. In 1968, the disease's link with mitochondrial activity was first ascertained, though the mutations in cytochrome c oxidase and other electron transport chain proteins were not discovered until 1977.

After the defeat of the Zulu Kingdom by the British, he attempted to create his own independent kingdom. From 1883 to 1884, he fought the Zulu king Cetshwayo, inflicting a series of defeats on him. Life Zibhebhu was a son of Maphita, son of Sojiyisa, son Jama, son of Ndaba. He belonged to Mandlakazi Royal Homestead. He was one of the 13 'kinglets' allocated land in the aftermath of the Anglo- Zulu War, and vied for the royal succession with another of Cetshwayo's sons, Dinuzulu. The British, seeing the futility of the division of Zululand, determined to restore Cetshwayo as the ultimate chief. However, they left Zibhebhu alone and his lands intact. Both Zibhebhu and Dinuzulu befriended Boer mercenaries to help them in their claims. On the 22 July 1883, led by a troop of mounted white mercenaries, Zibhebhu made a sudden descent upon Cetshwayo's kraal at Ulundi, which he destroyed. All Zibhebhu's men wore a piece of leopard skin round their heads as a distinguishing mark. Cetshwayo escaped, though wounded, into Nkandla forest. After repeated pleas from the Resident Commissioner, Sir Melmoth Osborn, the king moved to Eshowe, where he died a few months later, possibly by poisoning. Dinuzulu was left to fight for the succession, and with the help of General Louis Botha and Dinuzulu's Volunteers defeated Zibhebhu and his army at the Battle of Ghost Mountain (also known as the Battle of Tshaneni).

The Nobel Committee recognized his \\"excellent work on organometallic compounds [which]...led to new polymerization reactions and ... paved the way for new and highly useful industrial processes\\". He is also known for his work involving free-radicals, many-membered rings, and organometallic compounds, as well as the development of Ziegler‚ÄìNatta catalyst. One of many awards Ziegler received was the Werner von Siemens Ring in 1960 jointly with Otto Bayer and Walter Reppe, for expanding the scientific knowledge of and the technical development of new synthetic materials. Biography Early life and education Karl Ziegler was born November 26, 1898 in Helsa near Kassel, Germany and was the second son of Karl Ziegler, a Lutheran minister, and Luise Rall Ziegler. He attended Kassel-Bettenhausen in elementary school. An introductory physics textbook first sparked Ziegler's interest in science. It drove him to perform experiments in his home and to read extensively beyond his high school curriculum. He was also introduced to many notable individuals through his father, including Emil Adolf von Behring, recognized for the diphtheria vaccine. His extra study and experimentation help explain why he received an award for most outstanding student in his final year at high school in Kassel, Germany. He studied at the University of Marburg and was able to omit his first two semesters of study due to his extensive background knowledge. His studies were interrupted however, as during 1918 he was deployed to the front as a soldier to serve in World War I. He received his Ph.D. in 1920, studying under Karl von Auwers. His dissertation was on \\"Studies on semibenzole and related links\\" which led to three publications. Career Karl Ziegler showed an eagerness for science at an early age. He progressed through schooling quickly receiving a doctorate from the University of Marburg in 1920. Soon after, he briefly lectured at the University of Marburg and the University of Frankfurt. In 1926 he became a professor at the University of Heidelberg where he spent the next ten years researching new advances in organic chemistry. He investigated the stability of radicals on trivalent carbons leading him to study organometallic compounds and their application in his research. He also worked on the syntheses of multi-membered ring systems. including the Nobel Lecture, December 12, 1963 Consequences and Development of an Invention In 1933 Ziegler published his first major work on large ring systems, \\"Vielgliedrige Ringsysteme\\" which presented the fundamentals for the Ruggli-Ziegler dilution principle. Max Planck Institute for Coal Research. In 1936 he became Professor and Director of the Chemical Institute (Chemisches Institut) at the University of Halle/Saale and was also a visiting lecturer at the University of Chicago.

Das Harnack- Prinzip. de Gruyter, Berlin 1996, , S. 487f. From 1943 until 1969, Ziegler was the Director of the Max Planck Institute for Coal Research (Max-Planck- Institut fur Kohlenforschung) formerly known as the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute for Coal Research (Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut fur Kohlenforschung) in M√ºlheim an der Ruhr as a successor to Franz Fischer. Karl Ziegler was credited with much of the postwar resurrection of chemical research in Germany and helped found the German Chemical Society (Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker) in 1949. He served as president for five years. He was also the president of the German Society for Petroleum Science and Coal Chemistry (Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Mineral√∂lwissenschaft und Kohlechemie), from 1954 to 1957. In 1971, The Royal Society, London, elected him as a Foreign Member. Personal life In 1922, Ziegler married Maria Kurtz. They had two children, Erhart and Marianna. His daughter, Dr. Marianna Ziegler Witte was a doctor of medicine and married a chief physical of a children's hospital (at that time) in the Ruhr. His son, Dr. Erhart Ziegler, became a physicist and patent attorney. In addition to his children, Karl Ziegler has five grandchildren by his daughter, and five by his son. At least one of his grandchildren, Cordula Witte, attended his Nobel Prize reception as there is a picture of the two of them happily dancing. Ziegler enjoyed traveling around the world with his family, especially on cruises. He even charted special cruises and airplanes for eclipse viewing. It was during a 1972 eclipse-viewing cruise with his grandson that Karl Ziegler became ill. He died a year later. Ziegler and his wife were great lovers of the arts, particularly paintings. Karl and Maria would present each other with paintings for birthdays, Christmases, and anniversaries. They amassed a large collection of paintings, not necessarily of one particular period, but of paintings they enjoyed. Maria, being an avid gardener, particularly enjoyed flower paintings by Emil Nolde, Erich Heckel, Oskar Kokoschka, and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. Karl enjoyed pictures of the places that he and his wife called home, including pictures of Halle and the Ruhr valley. Forty-two images from their shared collection were incorporated into a foundation, bequeathed to the M√ºlheim Ziegler Art Museum. As a man of many discoveries, Karl Ziegler was also a man of many patents. As a result of his patent agreement with the Max Planck Institute, Ziegler was a wealthy man. With part of this wealth, he set up the Ziegler Fund with some 40 million deutsche marks to support the institute's research. Another namesake is the Karl-Ziegler-Schule, an urban high school that was founded on December 4, 1974, renaming a previously existing school. The school is located in M√ºlheim, Germany. Karl Ziegler died in M√ºlheim, Germany August 12, 1973 and his wife in 1980. Scientific advancements Throughout his life, Ziegler was a zealous advocate for the necessary indivisibility of all kinds of research. Because of this, his scientific achievements range from the fundamental to the most practical, and his research spans a wide range of topics within the field of chemistry. As a young professor, Ziegler posed the question: what factors contribute to the dissociation of carbon-carbon bonds in substituted ethane derivatives? This question was to lead Ziegler on to a study of free radicals, organometallics, ring compounds, and, finally, polymerization processes. Free radical compounds Example of three tri-valent carbon free radicals. 1. 1,2,4,5-tetraphenylallyl. 2. pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl. 3. triphenylmethyl. While still a doctoral student at University of Marburg, Ziegler published his first major article which showed how halochromic (R3C+Z‚àí) salts could be made from carbinols. Previous work had left the impression that halochromic salts or free radicals (R3C‚Ä¢) required R to be aromatic. He was encouraged to try to synthesize similarly substituted free radicals, and successfully prepared 1,2,4,5-tetraphenylallyl in 1923 and pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl in 1925. These two compounds were much more stable than previous tri-valent carbon free radicals, such as triphenylmethyl. His interest in the stability of tri-valent carbon free-radical compounds brought him to publish the first of many publications in which he sought to identify the steric and electronic factors responsible for the dissociation of hexa-substituted ethane derivatives. Many-membered ring compounds Ziegler's work with many-membered ring compounds also utilized the reactive nature of alkali metal compounds. He used strong bases such as the lithium and sodium salts of amines, to accomplish the cyclization of long-chain hydrocarbons possessing terminal cyano groups. The initially formed ring compound was then converted to the desired macrocyclic ketone product. Ziegler's synthetic method, which included running reactions at high dilution to favor the intramolecular cyclization over competing intermolecular reactions, resulted in yields superior to those of existing procedures (Laylin): he was able to prepare large-ringed alicyclic ketones, C14 to C33, in yields of 60‚Äì80%. An outstanding instance of this synthesis was the preparation of muscone, the odiferous principle of animal musk by Leopold Ru≈æiƒçka. Ziegler and co-workers published the first of their series of papers on the preparation of large ring systems in 1933. For his work in this area and in free-radical chemistry he was awarded the Liebig Memorial Medal in 1935. Organometallic compounds Ziegler's work with free radicals led him to the organo compounds of the alkali metals. He discovered that ether scission opened a new method of preparing sodium and potassium alkyls, and found that these compounds could easily be converted to the hexa-substituted ethane derivatives. The nature of the substituent could be easily and systematically altered using this synthetic route by simply changing the identity of the ether starting material. Lithium alkyls Later, in 1930, he directly synthesized lithium alkyls and aryls from metallic lithium and halogenated hydrocarbons. 4Li+2RX ‚Äì 2RLi This convenient synthesis spurred numerous studies of RLi reagents by others, and now organolithium reagents are one of the most versatile and valuable tools of the synthetic organic chemist. Ziegler's own research on lithium alkyls and olefins was to lead directly to his discovery of a new polymerization technique some 20 years later. Living polymerization In 1927, he found that when the olefin stilbene was added to an ethyl ether solution of phenylisopropyl potassium, an abrupt color change from red to yellow took place. He had just observed the first addition of an organoalkali metal compound across a carbon-carbon double bond. Further work showed that he could successively add more and more of the olefinic hydrocarbon butadiene to a solution of phenylisopropyl potassium and obtain a long-chain hydrocarbon with the reactive organopotassium end still intact. Oligomers such as these were the forerunners of the so-called \\"living polymers\\" Polyethylene Since Ziegler was working at the Max Planck Institute for Coal Research, ethylene was readily available as a byproduct from coal gas. Because of this cheap feedstock of ethylene and the relevance to the coal industry, Ziegler began experimenting with ethylene, and made it a goal to synthesize polyethylene of high molecular weight. His attempts were thwarted because a competing elimination reaction kept occurring causing an anomalous result: instead of ethylene being converted into a mixture of higher aluminum alkyls, its dimer, 1-butene, was almost the only product. It was reasoned that a contaminant must have been present to cause this unexpected elimination reaction, and the cause was eventually determined to be traces of nickel salts. Ziegler realized the significance of this finding; if a nickel salt could have such a dramatic influence on the course of an ethylene- aluminum alkyl reaction, then perhaps another metal might delay the elimination reaction. Ziegler and his student H. Breil found that salts of chromium, zirconium, and especially titanium did not promote the R2AlH- elimination but, instead, enormously accelerated the \\"growth\\" reaction. Simply passing ethylene, at atmospheric pressure, into a catalytic amount of TiCl3 and Et2AlCl dissolved in a higher alkane led to the prompt deposition of polyethylene. Ziegler was able to obtain high molecular weight polyethylene (MW > 30,000) and, most importantly, to do so at low ethylene pressures. The Ziegler group suddenly had a polymerization procedure for ethylene superior to all existing processes. Ziegler‚ÄìNatta catalyst In 1952, Ziegler disclosed his catalyst to the Montecatini Company in Italy, for which Giulio Natta was acting as a consultant. Natta denoted this class of catalysts as \\"Ziegler catalysts\\" and became extremely interested in their ability and potential to stereoregularly polymerize Œ±-olefins such as propene. Ziegler, meanwhile concentrated mainly on the large-scale production of polyethylene and copolymers of ethylene and propylene. Soon the scientific community was informed of his discovery. Highly crystalline and stereoregular polymers that previously could not be prepared became synthetically feasible. For their work on the controlled polymerization of hydrocarbons through the use of these novel organometallic catalysts, Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta shared the 1963 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

Tripp's action in secretly recording Monica Lewinsky's confidential phone calls about her relationship with President Bill Clinton caused a sensation with their links to the earlier Clinton v. Jones lawsuit and with the disclosing of intimate details. Tripp claimed that her motives were purely patriotic, and she was able to avoid a wiretap charge in exchange for handing in the tapes. She then claimed that her firing from the Pentagon at the end of the Clinton administration was vindictive, while the administration called it standard procedure for a political appointee. From 2004, Tripp and her husband, Dieter Rausch, owned and ran a year-round holiday store called The Christmas Sleigh in Middleburg, Virginia. Early life and career Tripp was born Linda Rose Carotenuto in Jersey City, New Jersey. She was the daughter of Albert Carotenuto, a high school math and science teacher, and his wife, Inge, a German woman whom he met when he was an American soldier stationed in Germany. They divorced in 1968 after he had an affair with a fellow teacher. She graduated from Hanover Park High School in East Hanover, New Jersey in 1968 and then worked as a secretary in Army Intelligence at Fort Meade, Maryland. In 1971, she married Bruce Tripp, a military officer with whom she had a son and a daughter. They divorced in 1990. Tripp transferred to the Pentagon in 1987. She was a White House employee in the George H. W. Bush administration, and kept her job when Bill Clinton became president in 1993. During the summer of 1994, senior White House aides wanted Tripp removed from the White House, so they arranged a job for her in the public affairs office in the Pentagon, which gave her a raise of $20,000 per year. Involvement in the Clinton‚ÄìLewinsky scandal Tripp became a close confidante of Monica Lewinsky, another former White House employee, while they both worked in the Pentagon's public affairs office. According to Tripp, who was about 24 years older than Lewinsky, they knew one another for a year and a half before the scandal began to reach its critical stage. After Lewinsky revealed to Tripp that she had been in a physical relationship with President Clinton, Tripp, acting on the advice of literary agent Lucianne Goldberg, began to secretly record phone conversations with Lewinsky while encouraging Lewinsky to document details of her relationship with the president. In August 1997, Michael Isikoff from Newsweek reported that Tripp said that she had encountered Kathleen Willey coming out of the Oval Office \\"disheveled\\", that \\"her face red and her lipstick was off.\\" Willey alleged that Clinton groped her. Clinton's lawyer Robert S. Bennett said in the Newsweek article \\"Linda Tripp is not to be believed.\\" In January 1998, Tripp gave the tapes to independent counsel Kenneth Starr in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Tripp disclosed to Starr that she was aware of the relationship between Lewinsky and Clinton, that Lewinsky had submitted a false affidavit denying the relationship to the federal court in Arkansas in the Clinton v. Jones lawsuit, and that Lewinsky had attempted to suborn Tripp's perjury in that suit to conceal what she knew of the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship and of Kathleen Willey from the federal court. As Tripp explained, she was being solicited to commit a crime to conceal evidence in the Jones civil rights case.Transcript: Linda Tripp on 'Larry King Live', CNN, February 16, 1999. Accessed October 9, 2007. Jones‚Äô lawsuit, initially filed in April 1994 through her attorneys Joseph Cammarata and Gilbert K. Davis, eventually resulted in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Clinton v. Jones which held that a sitting president of the United States does not have immunity against civil lawsuits for acts done before taking office, and unrelated to the office. Tripp also informed Starr of the existence of a navy blue dress that Lewinsky owned that was soiled with Clinton's semen. During their friendship, Lewinsky had shown the dress to Tripp and said she intended to have it dry-cleaned; Tripp convinced her not to have it cleaned. Based on Tripp's tapes, Starr obtained approval from Attorney General Janet Reno and the special court overseeing the independent counsel to expand Starr's investigation into the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship, looking for potential incidents of perjury, to investigate Lewinsky for perjury and suborning perjury as a witness in the lawsuit Paula Jones had brought against Clinton. Tripp also told Starr that she had evidence directly linking the White House to the Travelgate, Filegate, and Chinagate affairs, but Starr chose not to act on that, preferring to pursue the sex-related allegations. Tripp maintained that she acted out of \\"patriotic duty.\\" Tripp also claimed that she taped Lewinsky out of self-defense because she feared retaliation from the Clinton administration, also claiming Lewinsky had assured President Clinton that she had told only Tripp about their affair (which was untrue), thus making her a target since she refused to go along with perjuring herself to protect Lewinsky and the president. Eventually both Clinton and Lewinsky had to appear before a grand jury to answer questions, but Clinton appeared via closed circuit television. At the conclusion of Lewinsky's interrogation, the jurors offered Lewinsky the chance to offer any last words. \\"I hate Linda Tripp,\\" she said. Indictment by the state of Maryland Tripp was a resident of Hickory Ridge, Columbia, Maryland, at the time she made her surreptitious recordings of the conversations with Lewinsky, and 49 Democrats in the Maryland Legislature signed a letter to the state prosecutor demanding that Tripp be prosecuted under Maryland's wiretap law. Before the trial, the state court ruled that because of the immunity agreements which the independent counsel's office entered into with Tripp, Lewinsky, and others, a substantial amount of the evidence which the prosecution intended to use was inadmissible. At a pre-trial hearing, the prosecution called Lewinsky as a witness to try to establish her testimony against Tripp was untainted by the independent counsel's investigation. However, the Maryland state court ruled Lewinsky, who \\"admitted that she lied under oath in a federal proceeding and has stated that lying has been a part of her life,\\" was not credible and Lewinsky's proposed testimony against Tripp was \\"bathed in impermissible taint.\\" As a result, all charges against Tripp were dismissed on May 26, 2000 when the prosecution decided not to proceed with the trial of the case. Arrest record controversy Tripp had been arrested in 1969 when she was 19 years old in Greenwood Lake, New York on charges of stealing $263 in cash as well as a wristwatch worth about $600. The charges were dismissed before coming to trial. Years later, Tripp answered \\"no\\" to the question \\"Have you ever been either charged or arrested for a crime?\\" on her form for a United States Department of Defense security clearance. In March 1998, shortly before Tripp was scheduled to appear before the grand jury in the Lewinsky investigation, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Kenneth Bacon and his deputy Clifford Bernath leaked how Tripp had answered that question to Jane Mayer of The New Yorker. The Department of Defense then leaked other confidential information from Tripp's personnel and security files to the news media. The Department of Defense inspector general investigated these leaks and found that Bacon and Bernath violated the Privacy Act of 1974, and the United States Department of Defense inspector general concluded both Bacon and Bernath should have known the release of information from Tripp's security file was improper. Termination from government employment On January 19, 2001, the last full day of the Clinton Administration, Tripp was fired from her job in the Pentagon. Tripp claimed that the firing was vindictive, but the Clinton administration said that all political appointees such as Tripp are normally asked to submit their resignation when a new administration takes over. Those who refuse to do so may be fired. Lawsuit and settlement Tripp sued the Department of Defense and the Justice Department for releasing information from her security file and employment file to the news media in violation of the Privacy Act of 1974. On November 3, 2003, Tripp reached a settlement with the federal government. The settlement included a one-time payment of more than $595,000, a retroactive promotion, and retroactive pay at the highest salary for 1998, 1999, and 2000. She also received a pension and was cleared to work for the federal government again. Her rights to remain part of a class action against the government were preserved. Later years Tripp married German architect Dieter Rausch in 2004. They lived in Middleburg, Virginia, where they owned and operated a German winter-themed holiday store called the Christmas Sleigh. In an appearance with Larry King on Larry King Live on December 1, 2003, Tripp talked about living with breast cancer. On the subject of her successful invasion of privacy lawsuit against the federal government, Tripp claimed that she actually came out behind financially because of attorneys' fees and the derailment of her government career. She also claimed that her violations of Lewinsky's privacy and the Clinton administration's violations of her privacy were not equivalent as the Clinton administration's leaking of her employment history was illegal, noting that although her wiretapping was also illegal, she was able to avoid prosecution for such by accepting immunity in exchange for her testimony. In 2018, Tripp said that \\"she was the victim of 'a real high-tech lynching.'\\" Tripp, a long-time heavy smoker, died after a brief battle with pancreatic cancer at the age of 70 on April 8, 2020. In popular culture Tripp was portrayed by John Goodman in recurring Saturday Night Live sketches. Tripp had mixed feelings about the impression, saying she enjoyed most of the sketches, but mentioning that at least one had hurt her feelings. In the television series Impeachment: American Crime Story, slated to air in late 2020, Tripp will be portrayed by Sarah Paulson.

Freud revised the book at least eight times and, in the third edition, added an extensive section which treated dream symbolism very literally, following the influence of Wilhelm Stekel. Freud said of this work, \\"Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a lifetime.\\"SE iv. p. xxiii Dated 1900, the book was first published in an edition of 600 copies, which did not sell out for eight years. The Interpretation of Dreams later gained in popularity, and seven more editions were published in Freud's lifetime. Because of the book's length and complexity, Freud also wrote an abridged version called On Dreams. The original text is widely regarded as one of Freud's most significant works.  Background  Freud spent the summer of 1895 at Schloss BelleVue near Grinzing in Austria, where he began the inception of The Interpretation of Dreams. In a 1900 letter to Wilhelm Fliess, he wrote in commemoration of the place: While staying at Schloss Bellevue, Freud dreamed his famous dream of 'Irma's injection'. His reading and analysis of the dream allowed him to be exonerated from his mishandling of the treatment of a patient in 1895. In 1963, Belle Vue manor was demolished, but today a memorial plaque with just that inscription has been erected at the site by the Austrian Sigmund Freud Society.  Overview  Dreams, in Freud's view, are formed as the result of two mental processes. The first process involves unconscious forces that construct a wish that is expressed by the dream, and the second is the process of censorship that forcibly distorts the expression of the wish. In Freud's view, all dreams are forms of \\"wish fulfillment\\" (later in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud would discuss dreams which do not appear to be wish-fulfillment). Freud states: \\"My presumption that dreams can be interpreted at once puts me in opposition to the ruling theory of dreams and in fact to every theory of dreams...\\" Freud advanced the idea that an analyst can differentiate between the manifest content and latent content of a dream. The manifest content refers to the remembered narrative that plays out in the dream itself. The latent content refers to the underlying meaning of the dream. During sleep, the unconscious condenses, displaces, and forms representations of the dream content, the latent content of which is often unrecognizable to the individual upon waking. Critics have argued that Freud's theory of dreams requires sexual interpretation. Freud, however, contested this criticism, noting that \\"the assertion that all dreams require a sexual interpretation, against which critics rage so incessantly, occurs nowhere in my Interpretation of Dreams. It is not to be found in any of the numerous editions of this book and is in obvious contradiction to other views expressed in it.\\" Freud stated that ‚ÄúThe interpretation of dreams is the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind.\\"  Sources of dream content  Freud claimed that every dream has a connection point with an experience of the previous day. Though, the connection may be minor, as the dream content can be selected from any part of the dreamer's life. He described four possible sources of dreams: a) mentally significant experiences represented directly, b) several recent and significant experiences combined into a single unity by the dream, c) one or more recent and significant experiences which are represented in the content by the mention of a contemporary but indifferent experience, and d) an internal significant experience, such as a memory or train of thought, that is invariably represented in the dream by a mention of a recent but indifferent impression. Oftentimes people experience external stimuli, such as an alarm clock or music, being distorted and incorporated into their dreams. Freud explained that this is because \\"the mind is withdrawn from the external world during sleep, and it is unable to give it a correct interpretation ...\\" He further explained that our mind wishes to continue sleeping, and therefore will try to suppress external stimuli, weave the stimuli into the dream, compel a person to wake up, or encourage him or her to overcome it. Freud believed that dreams were picture-puzzles, and though they may appear nonsensical and worthless on the surface, through the process of interpretation they can form a \\"poetical phrase of the greatest beauty and significance.\\"  Condensation, displacement, and representation in dreams  Dreams are brief compared to the range and abundance of dream thoughts. Through condensation or compression, dream content can be presented in one dream. Oftentimes, people may recall having more than one dream in a night. Freud explained that the content of all dreams occurring on the same night represents part of the same whole. He believed that separate dreams have the same meaning. Often the first dream is more distorted and the latter is more distinct. Displacement of dream content has occurred when manifest content does not resemble the actual meaning of the dream. Displacement comes through the influence of a censorship agent. Representation in dreams is the causal relation between two things. Freud argues that two persons or objects can be combined into a single representation in a dream (see Freud's dream of his uncle and Friend R).  On Dreams  An abridged version called On Dreams was published in 1901 as part of Lowenfeld and Kurella's Grenzfragen des Nerven und Seelenlebens. It was re-published in 1911 in slightly larger form as a book.Gay, Peter edit. Freud, Sigmund author The Freud Reader WW Norton New York 1989 pages 142-142 On Dreams is also included in the 1953 edition and the second part of Freud's work on dreams, Volume Five, The Interpretation of Dreams II and On Dreams. It follows chapter seven in The Interpretation of Dreams and in this edition, is fifty-three pages in length. There are thirteen chapters in total and Freud directs the reader to The Interpretation of Dreams for further reading throughout On Dreams, in particular, in the final chapter. Immediately after its publication, Freud considered On Dreams as a shortened version of The Interpretation of Dreams. The English translation of On Dreams was first published in 1914 and the second English publication in the James Strachey translation from 1952. Freud investigates the subject of displacement and our inability to recognize our dreams. In chapter VI, page 659, he states: \\"It is the process of displacement which is chiefly responsible for our being unable to discover or recognize them in the dream-content\\" and he considers the issue of displacement in chapter VIII, page 671 as: \\"the most striking of the dream-work.\\"  Contents  The first edition begins: Freud begins his book in the first chapter titled \\"The Scientific Literature on the Problems of the Dream\\" by reviewing different scientific views on dream interpretation, which he finds interesting but not adequate.Freud, Sigmund The Interpretation of Dreams the Illustrated Edition, Sterling Press, 2010, pages 9-68 He then makes his argument by describing a number of dreams which he claims illustrate his theory. Freud describes three main types of dreams: 1\\\\. Direct prophecies received in the dream (chrematismos, oraculum); 2\\\\. The foretelling of a future event (orama, visio) 3\\\\. The symbolic dream, which requires interpretation (Interpretation of Dreams 5). Much of Freud's sources for analysis are in literature. Many of his most important dreams are his own ‚Äî his method is inaugurated with an analysis of his dream \\"Irma's injection\\" ‚Äî but many also come from patient case studies.  Influence and reception  Memorial plate in commemoration of the place where Freud began The Interpretation of Dreams, near Grinzing, Austria The Interpretation of Dreams was first published in an edition of only 600 copies, and these took eight years to sell. The work subsequently gained popularity, and seven more editions were printed in Freud's lifetime, the last in 1929. The classicist Norman O. Brown described The Interpretation of Dreams as one of the great applications and extensions of the Socratic maxim \\"know thyself\\" in Life Against Death (1959). The philosopher Paul Ric≈ìur described The Interpretation of Dreams as Freud's \\"first great book\\" in Freud and Philosophy (1965). He argued that like Freud's other works it posits a \\"semantics of desire\\". The mythologist Joseph Campbell described the book as an \\"epochal work\\", noting in The Masks of God: Creative Mythology (1968) that it was \\"based on insights derived from years devoted to the fantasies of neurotics\\". Max Schur, Freud's physician and friend, provided evidence in Freud: Living and Dying (1972) that the first dream that Freud analyzed, his so-called \\"Irma dream\\" was not very disguised, but actually closely portrayed a medical disaster of Emma Steinbeck, one of Freud's patients.Schur, M. (1972) Freud: Living and Dying. New York: International Universities Press The psychologist Hans Eysenck argued in Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire (1985) that the dreams Freud cites actually disprove Freud's dream theory. The philosopher John Forrester described The Interpretation of Dreams as Freud's \\"masterpiece\\" in Dispatches from the Freud Wars (1997). He suggested that the book could be considered a form of autobiographical writing and compared it to the naturalist Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859). The philosopher Dermot Moran compared the influence that The Interpretation of Dreams exerted on psychoanalysis to that which the philosopher Edmund Husserl's Logical Investigations (1900‚Äì1901) exerted on 20th-century European philosophy in his introduction to the latter work. The philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and the psychologist Sonu Shamdasani noted in The Freud Files (2012) that the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler wrote to Freud in October 1905 that he was convinced of the correctness of The Interpretation of Dreams as soon as he read it. They argued, however, that Freud's analysis of the dream of Irma's injection was partly based on Belgian psychologist Joseph Delboeuf's analysis of a dream in Sleep and Dreams. In their view, The Interpretation of Dreams should be placed in the context of the \\"introspective hypnotism\\" practiced by figures such as Auguste Forel, Eugen Bleuler, and Oskar Vogt. They charged Freud with selectively citing some authors on dreams (including Marie-Jean- L√©on, Marquis d'Hervey de Saint Denys and Louis Ferdinand Alfred Maury), ignoring others (including Jean-Martin Charcot, Pierre Janet, and Richard von Krafft-Ebing), and systematically avoiding \\"citing the passages in the works of his predecessors which came closest to his own theories.\\" E. James Lieberman and Robert Kramer wrote in an introduction to a collection of letters between Freud and the psychoanalyst Otto Rank that Rank was impressed by The Interpretation of Dreams when he read it in 1905, and was moved to write a critical reanalysis of one of Freud's own dreams. They suggested that it may have been partly this reanalysis that brought Rank to Freud's attention. They noted that it was with Rank's help that Freud published the second edition of The Interpretation of Dreams in 1909. The neuropsychoanalyst Mark Blechner argued in Contemporary Psychoanalysis that even if one does not agree with Freud's theories, The Interpretation of Dreams remains a valuable record of dream texts and an analysis of the mental operations that dreams demonstrate.Blechner, M. J. (2013) What are dreams like and how does the brain make them that way? Contemporary Psychoanalysis, 49(2): 165-175. Art historian and filmmaker Joseph Koerner drew the title of his 2019 film The Burning Child from a dream of that title, which opens Chapter 7 of Interpretation of Dreams.

The population (2006) is estimated to be 49,137 and the total area of the municipality is . It lies at an elevation of just off the main interstate highway, BR040, between the urban centers of Barbacena (north) and Juiz de Fora (south). It is from the state capital, Belo Horizonte, and from Rio de Janeiro. It became a city in 1889. Climate The average annual temperature is approximately , with the average maximum of , and the average minimum of . Economy Agriculture Livestock raising is the main economic activity with approximately 30,000 head of cattle and an annual production of milk of about . The region produces corn, strawberries, guava, nectaries, manioc, beans, oranges, coffee, peach and banana. Industry Santos Dumont has the Companhia Brasileira de Carbureto de C√°lcio, (CBCC), which produces silicone iron and metallic silicone, exporting to several countries. History Santos Dumont is the birthplace of aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont and is named in his honour. Prior to the renaming the city was known as Palmira. The Cabangu museum, located from the centre of the city () is dedicated to his memory. It is located in the house where he was born and has personal objects, photos and an aviation museum. Demographics Since the 1980s the municipality has been experiencing a period of slight demographic standstill. Between the census held in 1996 and the census held in 2000 the population increased at the rate of 0.32% per annum which is much lower than other places in the country. This is partially explained by the economic attraction of the nearby city of Juiz de Fora, making it the destination of many immigrants. According to the 2000 census, the average income of the workers of the municipality was calculated at R$450 (237 USD at that time), but workers earning less than the national minimum wage (R$151, 80 USD) accounted for 38.8% of the total employees, meanwhile only 1.00% of them earned more than the equivalent to 20 minimum wages (R$3,020 or 1,590 USD).  Tourism  Cabangu Museum - Night photography. Santos Dumont has a rich tourism. It includes the Estrada Real (Royal Road, a set of colonial-era roads in Brazil), associated to an ecological tourism. There are 10 Kilometers of road until the division with the town of Ant√¥nio Carlos. During the route, it is possible to observe a nice natural landscape, old farms and two fountains, from the time of their construction, also well some rock records. Theses fountains were used for a parade of drovers while came from the interior of Minas Gerais, bringing gold to Rio de Janeiro, at the time of Colonial Brazil. Besides that, in the city stand out the Cabangu Museum birthplace of Alberto Santos Dumont, in the district of Mantiqueira, 16 km from the city center. The Ponte Preta Dam, in the neighborhood of Ponte Preta, allows leisure activities where people go swimming, boating, fishing, camping and spending the day free for leisure. From September to January, the dam is empty, but on-site leisure activities are possible such as campgrounds and events like ‚ÄúOff Road‚Äù.

Chuchiak IV, \\"Juan de Zum√°rraga\\" in Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures, David Carrasco, ed. New York: Oxford University Press 2001, vol. 3, pp. 380-81. He wrote Doctrina breve, the first book published in the Western hemisphere, printed in Mexico City in 1539. Origins and arrival in New Spain Zum√°rraga was born in 1468 or 1469 of a noble family, in Durango in the Biscay province in Spain. He entered the Franciscan Order, and in 1527 was custodian of the convent of Abrojo. Shortly afterwards he was appointed one of the judges of the court for the examination of witches in the Basque province. From his writings it would appear that he looked upon witches merely as women possessed of hallucinations. By this time more detailed accounts of the importance of the conquest of Hern√°n Cort√©s began to be received, and on December 20, 1527, Zum√°rraga was recommended by Charles V for the post of first bishop of Mexico. Without having been consecrated and with only the title of bishop-elect and Protector of the Indians, he, accompanied by Fray Andr√©s de Olmos, left Spain with the first civil officials, magistrates (oidores), towards the end of August 1528, and reached Mexico on December 6. Thirteen days after, two of these judges, Alonso de Parada and Diego Maldonado, men of years and experience, died. Their companions, Juan Ortiz de Matienzo and Diego Delgadillo, assumed their authority, which was also shared by Nu√±o de Guzm√°n, who had come from his territories in the P√°nuco Valley. Their administration was one of the most disastrous epochs in New Spain and one of great difficulty for Zum√°rraga. \\"Protector of the Indians\\" Juan de Zum√°rraga, the first archbishop of Mexico City Although Zum√°rraga was appointed bishop on August 20, 1530, he was not consecrated until April 27, 1533. Zum√°rraga, as Protector of the Indians, endeavored to defend them. His position was a critical one; the Spanish monarchy had defined neither the extent of his jurisdiction nor his duties as Protector of the Indians. Moreover, he had not received official consecration as bishop, and was thus at a disadvantage when he attempted to exercise his authority. The Indians appealed to him as protector with all manner of complaints. His own Franciscans, who had so long labored for the welfare of the Indians, pressed him to put an end to the excesses of the auditors. It was clear that he must have had an open conflict with the civil officials of the colony, relying only on his spiritual prerogatives, which commanded no respect from these immoral and unprincipled men. Some members of other religious orders, perhaps envious of the influence of the Franciscans, upheld the persecution of the Indians. Bishop Zum√°rraga attempted to notify the Spanish court of the course of events, but the auditors had established a successful censorship of all letters and communications from New Spain. Finally, a Biscayne sailor concealed a letter in a cake of wax which he immersed in a barrel of oil. Meanwhile, news reached Mexico that Cort√©s had been well received at the Spanish court and was about to return to New Spain. Fearful of the consequences, Nu√±o de Guzm√°n left Mexico City on December 22, 1529, and began his famous expedition to Michoac√°n, Jalisco, and Sinaloa. The remaining auditors retained power and continued their outrages. In the early part of 1530 they dragged a priest and a former servant of Cort√©s from a church, quartered him and tortured his servant. Zum√°rraga placed the city under interdict, and the Franciscans retired to Texcoco. At Easter the interdict was lifted, but the auditors were excommunicated for a year. On July 15, 1530, Cort√©s, now titled Captain General of New Spain, reached Vera Cruz. The Crown appointed new auditors, among them Sebasti√°n Ram√≠rez de Fuenleal, Bishop of Santo Domingo, and the lawyer Vasco de Quiroga, who later became the first Bishop of Michoac√°n. In December of the same year, the new Audiencia, the ensemble of auditors, reached Mexico and, with them, an era of peace for both Zum√°rraga and the Indians. Matienzo and Delgadillo were sent to Spain as prisoners, but Nu√±o de Guzm√°n escaped, being then absent in Sinaloa. Meantime the calumnies spread by the enemies of Zum√°rraga and the partisans of the first auditor had shaken the confidence of the Spanish Court, and he set sail in May 1532 under orders to return to Spain. On his arrival he met his implacable enemy Delgadillo, who, though still under indictment, continued his calumnies. As a result of Delgadillo's charges, Charles V held back the Bull of Clement VII, originally dated September 2, 1530, that would have named Zum√°rraga bishop. Zum√°rraga, however, had little difficulty vindicating his good name, and was consecrated bishop at Valladolid on April 27, 1533 by Diego Ribera de Toledo, Bishop of Segovia, with Francisco Zamora de Orello, Titular Bishop of Brefny, and Francisco Sol√≠s, Bishop of Drivasto, as Co- Consecrators.Catholic Hierarchy: \\"Archbishop Juan de Zum√°rraga, O.F.M.\\" retrieved November 11, 2015 After another year in Spain working for favourable concessions for the Indians, he reached Mexico in October 1534, accompanied by a number of mechanics and six female teachers for the Indian girls. He no longer held the title of Protector of the Indians, as it was thought that the new auditors would refrain from the abuses of prior regimes. On November 14, 1535, with the arrival of the first viceroy, Antonio de Mendoza, the rule of the new auditors ended. While bishop, he was the principal consecrator of Juan Lopez de Z√°rate, Bishop of Antequera, Oaxaca (1537); Francisco Marroqu√≠n Hurtado, Bishop of Santiago de Guatemala (1537); and Vasco de Quiroga, Bishop of Michoac√°n (1539). Evangelization efforts According to Fray Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, the number of baptized Indians in Mexico in 1536 was five million. The multitude of Indians who asked for baptism, said to have greatly increased after the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe in 1531, forced the missionaries to adopt a special form for administering this sacrament. The catechumens were arranged in order, with children in front. Prayers were recited in common over all, salt, saliva, etc., applied to a few, and then water was poured on the head of each without using the customary holy oils or chrism. The practice faced no opposition while the Franciscans were in charge of the missions, but as soon as members of other religious orders and some secular ecclesiastics arrived, doubt began to be cast upon the validity of these baptisms. To put an end to the dispute Bishop Zum√°rraga submitted the case to Rome, and on June 1, 1537, Pope Paul III issued the bull Altitudo divini consilii, which declared that the friars had not sinned in administering baptism in this form, but decreed that in the future it should not be thus administered except in cases of urgent need. Another difficulty arose regarding marriage. The pre-Columbian religions had permitted polygyny and the taking of concubines, and when Natives were converted the question arose as to which were legitimate wives and which were concubines, and whether any of the marriages had been valid at all. The Franciscans knew that certain rites were observed for certain unions, and that in some cases, where separation or divorce was desired, it was necessary to obtain the consent of the authorities, while in other cases the consent of the interested parties sufficed. These customs, they argued, meant that there were valid marriages among the Indians. Others denied that this was the case. Bishop Zum√°rraga took part in all these discussions until the case was submitted to the Holy See. Pope Paul III decreed in the Altitudo that the converted Indians should keep the first woman wed as their wife. A third important difficulty concerned the position of the regular clergy (non-order affiliated) and their privileges. Adrian VI on May 9, 1522, issued the bull Exponi nobis fecisti to Charles V, in which he transferred his own Apostolic authority in all matters to the Franciscans and other mendicant orders when they judged it necessary for the conversion of the Indians, except for acts requiring episcopal consecration. This provision affected regions where there was no bishop, or where it required two or more days of travel to reach one. Pope Paul III confirmed the bull on January 15, 1535. The bishops found their authority much limited, and a series of assemblies followed in which Zum√°rraga with his customary prudence tried to arrive at an understanding with the regulars without openly clashing with them. Various modifications were adopted with the consent of the regulars on condition that these \\"should not impair the privileges of the regulars\\". The question therefore remained open. In 1535, Bishop Zum√°rraga received the title and powers of Apostolic Inquisitor of the diocese of Mexico from the Inquisitor General, √Ålvaro Manrique, Archbishop of Seville, including that of delivering criminals to the secular courts. He never availed himself of the title and did not establish the tribunal, although he did indict and deliver to the secular courts a lord of Texcoco, known as Don Carlos Ometochtzin Chichimecatecuhtli, accused of having \\"reverted to idolatry\\" and of offering human sacrifices. Meanwhile, Fray Las Casas had gone to Spain and obtained from the Junta of Valladolid (1541-1542) the approbation of the celebrated \\"Nuevas Leyes\\". These laws conclusively and decisively prohibited the enslavement of the Indians, withdrew all grants from all corporations, ecclesiastical and secular, and from those who were or had been Viceroys, governors, or employees of any description whatsoever; previous grants were reduced; Indians were taken from owners who had ill-treated them; all governors were deprived of the faculty to \\"encomendar\\" (a system of patents which permitted forced labor of the Indians); owners were compelled to live upon their own possessions; and in all newly discovered territory no grants could be made. Francisco Tello de Sandoval, commissioned to carry out the New Laws, reached Mexico on March 8, 1544. The gravest difficulties confronted him. Those affected by the new laws were almost all the Spaniards of the colony, many of them far advanced in years, who had passed through all the trying period of the conquest, and whom the new laws would leave in abject poverty. These had recourse to Bishop Zum√°rraga to intercede with Tello to obtain a suspension of the order until they could be heard before the Spanish Court. The representatives of the colonists found the emperor, Charles V, at Mechlin, on October 20, 1545. In virtue of the situation as explained to him, he modified the general tenor of the laws so that while still correcting the principal abuses, they would not bear too heavily on the Spaniards of the colony. Through the prudent intervention of Bishop Zum√°rraga and the compliance of Tello, Mexico was undoubtedly saved from a bloody civil struggle such as engulfed Peru on account of the enforcement of these same laws and from which the Indians emerged worse off than they were before. Later years The last years of Bishop Zum√°rraga's life were devoted to carrying out the numerous works he had undertaken for the welfare of his diocese. Among the chief of these should be mentioned: the school for Indian girls; the famous Colegio de Santa Cruz in Tlatelolco; the introduction of the first printing press into the New World; the foundation of various hospitals, especially those of Mexico and Vera Cruz; the impetus he gave to industries, agriculture, and manufactures, for which he brought trained mechanics and labourers from Spain; and the printing of many books. At the instance of the emperor, Pope Paul III separated (February 11, 1546) the See of Mexico from the metropolitan See of Seville, and erected the Archdiocese of Mexico, appointing Bishop Zum√°rraga first archbishop and designating the dioceses of Oaxaca, Michoac√°n, Tlaxcala, Guatemala, and Ciudad Real de Chiapas, as suffragans. The Bull of appointment was sent on July 8, 1548, but Bishop Zum√°rraga had died one month previously. Bishop Zumarraga is also credited with chocolate becoming a popular drink among Europeans. A community of nuns in Oaxaca, after encountering a recipe of cocoa mixed with sugar, prepared it for the bishop. Prior to this, ground cocoa had not found a role in European diets.Mercier, Jacques.

The word's use as an occupational title continued until the mid-19th century, often combined with other words such as in shipwright, wheelwright,Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights wainwright and playwright. , Wright was the eleventh most common surname in England.

It is different from most other card games, in that the rules and the conditions for winning are altered throughout the game, via cards played by the players. History Fluxx was created by Andrew Looney on as the first game for his and his wife's part-time game design company, Looney Laboratory. The original print run was for 5,000 units and was released in 1997. The game was successful and was licensed a year later to Iron Crown Enterprises (ICE) for wider distribution. ICE went bankrupt two years later and Looney Labs resumed publication and distribution. By , Labs was considering putting out another standalone deck version called Fluxx++ using card created by the Fluxx playing community with Fluxx Blanxx and Fluxx: Goals Galore, an expansion consisting of goal cards, based on its Origins 2000 5 Goal cards promo pack. Labs created Fluxx Lite, a slimmed down 56 card deck to lower the price for discount superstores, in design by . In 2003, Amigo Games, a German game company, licensed and published a German language version of Fluxx. The in design Fluxx Reduxx was indefinitely placed on hold as of to focus on EcoFluxx. Looney Labs registered the Fluxx trademark. By , Stoner Fluxx had been released and EcoFluxx was in play testing, and scheduled to be released later that month followed by Family Fluxx. In , Looney Labs issued a Spanish language edition of the game. The release of a zombie-themed version brought the first of a new card type, the Creeper and Ungoal. In 2008, Toy Vault and Looney Labs co-published and released Monty Python Fluxx. Fluxx edition 4 was released in and was the first set to have the Meta Rule subtype card, which stemmed from a Fluxx Tournament rule. In 2008, Zombie Fluxx won the Origins Award for Traditional Card Game of the Year. Stoner Fluxx was placed back in print under the Full Baked Ideas imprint of Looney Labs on after being out of print for four years. Full Baked was launched with expectation of a future release of a drinking variant and other mature subject versions. Two variants were re-released on , EcoFluxx and Family Fluxx, with Eco being a new edition. In , the Surprise subtype of cards were introduced in the Pirate Fluxx themed variant. In , the German language version 2nd edition was released by Pegasus Games. By over 1 million decks of all Fluxx versions had been sold while Pirate Fluxx was getting into bookstores that month. On , Looney Labs got a simplified, less expensive general market version with redesigned packaging of Fluxx into Target stores. For the summer 2012, Fluxx was number 10 in ICv2's Top 10 Card/Building Games (hobby channel). A Cartoon Network version of the game was made available as a Target exclusive from mid-August 2014 until Easter 2015, while in July the Regular Show Fluxx was released to the hobby market. The fifth edition of the regular Fluxx game was made available beginning in 2014 as the 4.0 edition ran out. Looney Labs teamed up with The Doubleclicks for a Fluxx theme song. A new expansion of the game, Fluxx Dice, plus two new licensed variants were scheduled to be released in the summer of 2015. With a delay of the first variant to be released at the polled requested of the retailers, Looney Labs pushed back the dice and the other variant to stagger the releases to spread out the impact. A series of educational variants were released in 2017 and 2018. In partnership with Gale Force 9, two Fluxx versions of Star Trek will be released in August 2018. Game description and play The first edition deck consists of 84 cards with four types of cards: Keepers, Goals, Actions, and New Rules. While the game begins by requiring players to simply draw and play a specific number of cards, the mechanic mutates when a New Rule card is played. The card may change the number of cards drawn or played per turn, the number of cards held per hand, or the Keepers played. The Goal cards change the Keepers needed to win the game. Games last from 5 to 30 minutes. Later sets sometimes included new card subtypes, depending on the theme of the set. These include included Creeper cards that block or make goals more difficult to obtain; Ungoal cards, which have conditions where the game ends with no winner; and Surprise cards, a 2011 addition, which allow players to negate other types of cards which could prevent a victory and can be played at any time, though they have other effects when played on one's own turn. The first Fluxx tournament at Origins 1997 had an extra rule calling for an increase in the Basic Rules each time the deck was reshuffled which was kept for future tournaments. On via their Wunderland blog, Looney introduced \\"Meta Rule\\" cards for players to print at home and add to standard decks or place in the primary deck Edition 4.0. Early edition decks had 84 cards while newer standard decks have 100 cards, while Lite versions (Family, Spanish, SE) consist of 56 cards.

This game was awarded the Parents' Choice Recommended Seal Fall 2013 for Games. The game moves the Keeper card items to spaces on the board while adding the \\"Leaper\\" card type. The board is separated into 9 movable tiles with four spaces each except for the start tile with the initial set up of 3x3 square. Besides the Keeper spaces there are 1 octagon space per title and two teleport spaces for the whole board. Moving on to one teleport space allows the player to move to the other teleport space. The octagon may hold any number of pawns while the keeper spaces can only have one with an incoming pawn pushing out the current pawn. There are two peg boards that track, the number of goals needed to win and current rules. All start with a hand of three cards and a color card in face up to indicate the pawns they control. The each get to make a free rule change. New general rules affecting the tiles include rotation, moving and allowing wraparound tile movement. The game only has Action, Goals, New Rules and Leaper type cards. Action cards can change force a change in player color. A Leaper card counts as a card play but allows you to move a pawn to the item on the board. Goals cards are stacked near the board with top most card the current goal. Promotional cards Looney Labs gives away promotional cards related to Fluxx at conventions such as Gen Con and Origins. They have given away cards such as Composting and Jackpot, which later appeared in EcoFluxx and Family Fluxx respectively. They have also given away promo cards for Christmas to members of their online mailing list and in High Times magazine. Game Technicians (previously known as Mad Lab Rabbits), voluntary game demonstrators for Looney Labs, give away promo cards to people interested in the game. *Origins 2000 Goal promo 5 card pack. * Sir Not Appearing In This Game!

However, both Volity.net and CCG Workshop are no longer operating.Google.com In December 2012, Fluxx was released by Playdek as an app on iOS operating systems (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Apple TV) by purchasing it from the Apple App Store. It uses the \\"mass market\\" deck developed for Target Stores, removing some of the more esoteric themes (such as Cthulhu) and complex rule cards. Reception The base game won the Mensa Select Game Award in 1999. Rick Loomis comments: \\"Fluxx makes a good game for a group that has one of those annoying 'I-must-win-every-game' types. The rest of you can enjoy yourselves as the game spins out of his control (as it surely will) and perhaps he'll eventually learn to lose gracefully. Meanwhile, Fluxx will be busily exercising everyone's logic synapses as you attempt to deal with the chaotic situations that occur because of the cheerful clash of rules.\\" An ICv2 review of the Batman variant by Nick Smith gave it 4 out of 5 stars as \\"The Fluxx series of games is not for everyone.\\" But the game worked well with the Batman theme: \\"The game-themed victory conditions are good, and the thematic elements were very well thought out. This may be the best-designed Fluxx set in some time, and it can be a lot of fun for casual fans to try to achieve the thematic victory conditions.\\" See also * 1000 Blank White Cards * Looney Labs * Aquarius * Chrononauts * Dvorak * Mao, another card game with changing rules * Nomic * Treehouse and Icehouse References External links * , official game site  Fluxx family at Board Game Geek * The designer explains the Hand Limit rules * Fully Baked Ideas Official Site, adult versions imprint Category:Andrew Looney games Category:Amigo Spiele games Category:Card games introduced in 1996 Category:Dedicated deck card games Category:Mensa Select winners ","title":"Fluxx"},{"id":"558685","text":"Land management has preserved the natural characteristics of Hopetoun Falls, Australia while allowing ample access for visitors. Sahara desert from satellite. It is the world's largest hot desert and third-largest desert after the polar deserts. The natural environment encompasses all living and non- living things occurring naturally, meaning in this case not artificial. The term is most often applied to the Earth or some parts of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity. The concept of the natural environment can be distinguished as components: * Complete ecological units that function as natural systems without massive civilized human intervention, including all vegetation, microorganisms, soil, rocks, atmosphere, and natural phenomena that occur within their boundaries and their nature. * Universal natural resources and physical phenomena that lack clear-cut boundaries, such as air, water, and climate, as well as energy, radiation, electric charge, and magnetism, not originating from civilized human actions. In contrast to the natural environment is the built environment. In such areas where humans have fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural land conversion, the natural environment is greatly changed into a simplified human environment. Even acts which seem less extreme, such as building a mud hut or a photovoltaic system in the desert, the modified environment becomes an artificial one. Though many animals build things to provide a better environment for themselves, they are not human, hence beaver dams, and the works of mound-building termites, are thought of as natural. People seldom find absolutely natural environments on Earth, and naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from 100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other. More precisely, we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment, and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform. If, for instance, in an agricultural field, the mineralogic composition and the structure of its soil are similar to those of an undisturbed forest soil, but the structure is quite different. Natural environment is often used as a synonym for habitat, for instance, when we say that the natural environment of giraffes is the savanna.  Composition  volcanic fissure and lava channel Earth's layered structure: (1) inner core; (2) outer core; (3) lower mantle; (4) upper mantle; (5) lithosphere; (6) crust Earth science generally recognizes four spheres, the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and the biosphere Earth's Spheres .

Some scientists include as part of the spheres of the Earth, the cryosphere (corresponding to ice) as a distinct portion of the hydrosphere, as well as the pedosphere (corresponding to soil) as an active and intermixed sphere. Earth science (also known as geoscience, the geographical sciences or the Earth Sciences), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet Earth.Wordnet Search: Earth science There are four major disciplines in earth sciences, namely geography, geology, geophysics and geodesy. These major disciplines use physics, chemistry, biology, chronology and mathematics to build a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the principal areas or spheres of Earth. Geological activity The Earth's crust, or lithosphere, is the outermost solid surface of the planet and is chemically and mechanically different from underlying mantle. It has been generated greatly by igneous processes in which magma cools and solidifies to form solid rock. Beneath the lithosphere lies the mantle which is heated by the decay of radioactive elements. The mantle though solid is in a state of rheic convection. This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as plate tectonics. Volcanoes result primarily from the melting of subducted crust material or of rising mantle at mid-ocean ridges and mantle plumes. Water on Earth Coral reefs have significant marine biodiversity. Most water is found in various kinds of natural body of water.  Oceans  An ocean is a major body of saline water, and a component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the surface of the Earth (an area of some 362 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800 ft) deep. Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several separate oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the World Ocean or global ocean.\\"\\". The Columbia Encyclopedia. 2002. New York: Columbia University Press\\"Distribution of land and water on the planet \\". UN Atlas of the Oceans The deep seabeds are more than half the Earth's surface, and are among the least-modified natural environments. The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the continents, various archipelagos, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean and the Arctic Ocean.  Rivers  A river is a natural watercourse,River {definition} from Merriam-Webster. Accessed February 2010. usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. A few rivers simply flow into the ground and dry up completely without reaching another body of water. Rocky stream in the U.S. state of Hawaii The water in a river is usually in a channel, made up of a stream bed between banks. In larger rivers there is often also a wider floodplain shaped by waters over-topping the channel. Flood plains may be very wide in relation to the size of the river channel. Rivers are a part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of water stored in glaciers and snowpacks. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek and brook. Their current is confined within a bed and stream banks. Streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity. The study of streams and waterways in general is known as surface hydrology.http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/hydrology.html/ date=June 20, 2019  Lakes  L√°car Lake, of glacial origin, in the A lake (from Latin lacus) is a terrain feature, a body of water that is localized to the bottom of basin. A body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, is not part of an ocean, and is larger and deeper than a pond. A swamp area in Everglades National Park, Florida, US. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.  Ponds  A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams by their current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro- currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.  Human impact on water  Humans impact the water in different ways such as modifying rivers (through dams and stream channelization), urbanization, and deforestation. These impact lake levels, groundwater conditions, water pollution, thermal pollution, and marine pollution. Humans modify rivers by using direct channel manipulation. We build dams and reservoirs and manipulate the direction of the rivers and water path. Dams can usefully create reservoirs and hydroelectric power. However, reservoirs and dams may negatively impact the environment and wildlife. Dams stop fish migration and the movement of organisms downstream. Urbanization affects the environment because of deforestation and changing lake levels, groundwater conditions, etc. Deforestation and urbanization go hand in hand. Deforestation may cause flooding, declining stream flow, and changes in riverside vegetation. The changing vegetation occurs because when trees cannot get adequate water they start to deteriorate, leading to a decreased food supply for the wildlife in an area.

A view of Earth's troposphere from an airplane Lightning is an atmospheric discharge of electricity accompanied by thunder, which occurs during thunderstorms and certain other natural conditions. The atmosphere of the Earth serves as a key factor in sustaining the planetary ecosystem. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by the planet's gravity. Dry air consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% argon and other inert gases, and carbon dioxide. The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases. The atmosphere includes greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds. Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor and suspensions of water droplets and ice crystals seen as clouds. Many natural substances may be present in tiny amounts in an unfiltered air sample, including dust, pollen and spores, sea spray, volcanic ash, and meteoroids. Various industrial pollutants also may be present, such as chlorine (elementary or in compounds), fluorine compounds, elemental mercury, and sulphur compounds such as sulphur dioxide (SO2). The ozone layer of the Earth's atmosphere plays an important role in reducing the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes. Layers of the atmosphere Principal layers Earth's atmosphere can be divided into five main layers. These layers are mainly determined by whether temperature increases or decreases with altitude. From highest to lowest, these layers are: * Exosphere: The outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere extends from the exobase upward, mainly composed of hydrogen and helium. * Thermosphere: The top of the thermosphere is the bottom of the exosphere, called the exobase. Its height varies with solar activity and ranges from about . The International Space Station orbits in this layer, between . * Mesosphere: The mesosphere extends from the stratopause to . It is the layer where most meteors burn up upon entering the atmosphere. * Stratosphere: The stratosphere extends from the tropopause to about . The stratopause, which is the boundary between the stratosphere and mesosphere, typically is at . * Troposphere: The troposphere begins at the surface and extends to between at the poles and at the equator, with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is mostly heated by transfer of energy from the surface, so on average the lowest part of the troposphere is warmest and temperature decreases with altitude. The tropopause is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere. ; Other layers Within the five principal layers determined by temperature there are several layers determined by other properties. * The ozone layer is contained within the stratosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about , though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in our atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere. * The ionosphere, the part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation, stretches from and typically overlaps both the exosphere and the thermosphere. It forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere. * The homosphere and heterosphere: The homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element. * The planetary boundary layer is the part of the troposphere that is nearest the Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through turbulent diffusion. Effects of global warming The retreat of glaciers since 1850 of Aletsch Glacier in the Swiss Alps (situation in 1979, 1991 and 2002), due to global warming The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Efforts have been increasingly focused on the mitigation of greenhouse gases that are causing climatic changes, on developing adaptative strategies to global warming, to assist humans, other animal, and plant species, ecosystems, regions and nations in adjusting to the effects of global warming. Some examples of recent collaboration to address climate change and global warming include: Another view of the Aletsch Glacier in the Swiss Alps, which because of global warming has been decreasing * The United Nations Framework Convention Treaty and convention on Climate Change, to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Retrieved August 2008. * The Kyoto Protocol, which is the protocol to the international Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty, again with the objective of reducing greenhouse gases in an effort to prevent anthropogenic climate change.Kyoto Protocol from United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Retrieved August 2008. * The Western Climate Initiative, to identify, evaluate, and implement collective and cooperative ways to reduce greenhouse gases in the region, focusing on a market-based cap-and-trade system.Western Climate Initiative, Retrieved on Feb 12, 2009. A significantly profound challenge is to identify the natural environmental dynamics in contrast to environmental changes not within natural variances. A common solution is to adapt a static view neglecting natural variances to exist. Methodologically, this view could be defended when looking at processes which change slowly and short time series, while the problem arrives when fast processes turns essential in the object of the study. Climate Worldwide climate classifications map Climate looks at the statistics of temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological elements in a given region over long periods of time. Weather, on the other hand, is the present condition of these same elements over periods up to two weeks. Climates can be classified according to the average and typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme is the one originally developed by Wladimir K√∂ppen. The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, uses evapotranspiration as well as temperature and precipitation information to study animal species diversity and the potential impacts of climate changes. Weather A rainbow is an optical and meteorological phenomenon that causes a spectrum of light to appear in the sky when the Sun shines onto droplets of moisture in the Earth's atmosphere. Weather is a set of all the phenomena occurring in a given atmospheric area at a given time.Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Weather. Retrieved on 2008-06-27. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere,Glossary of Meteorology. Hydrosphere. Retrieved on 2008-06-27.Glossary of Meteorology. Troposphere.

Weather refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \\"weather\\" is understood to be the weather of Earth. Weather occurs due to density (temperature and moisture) differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On the Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ¬±40 ¬∞C (100 ¬∞F to ‚àí40 ¬∞F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in the Earth's orbit have affected the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The atmosphere is a chaotic system, and small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that civilized human activity such as agriculture and industry has inadvertently modified weather patterns. Life There are many plant species on the planet. An example of the many animal species on the Earth Evidence suggests that life on Earth has existed for about 3.7 billion years.\\"History of life through time\\". University of California Museum of Paleontology. All known life forms share fundamental molecular mechanisms, and based on these observations, theories on the origin of life attempt to find a mechanism explaining the formation of a primordial single cell organism from which all life originates. There are many different hypotheses regarding the path that might have been taken from simple organic molecules via pre-cellular life to protocells and metabolism. Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli and reproduction. Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of organisms. In biology, the science of living organisms, \\"life\\" is the condition which distinguishes active organisms from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, functional activity and the continual change preceding death.The Concise Oxford Dictionary. English Edition 1991 A diverse variety of living organisms (life forms) can be found in the biosphere on Earth, and properties common to these organisms‚Äîplants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria‚Äîare a carbon- and water-based cellular form with complex organization and heritable genetic information. Living organisms undergo metabolism, maintain homeostasis, possess a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, reproduce and, through natural selection, adapt to their environment in successive generations. More complex living organisms can communicate through various means. Ecosystems Rainforests often have a great deal of biodiversity with many plant and animal species. This is the Gambia River in Senegal's Niokolo- Koba National Park. An ecosystem (also called as environment) is a natural unit consisting of all plants, animals and micro-organisms (biotic factors) in an area functioning together with all of the non-living physical (abiotic) factors of the environment. Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that living organisms are continually engaged in a highly interrelated set of relationships with every other element constituting the environment in which they exist. Eugene Odum, one of the founders of the science of ecology, stated: \\"Any unit that includes all of the organisms (i.e.: the \\"community\\") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem.\\" Old-growth forest and a creek on Larch Mountain, in the U.S. state of Oregon The human ecosystem concept is then grounded in the deconstruction of the human/nature dichotomy, and the emergent premise that all species are ecologically integrated with each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their biotope. A greater number or variety of species or biological diversity of an ecosystem may contribute to greater resilience of an ecosystem, because there are more species present at a location to respond to change and thus \\"absorb\\" or reduce its effects. This reduces the effect before the ecosystem's structure is fundamentally changed to a different state. This is not universally the case and there is no proven relationship between the species diversity of an ecosystem and its ability to provide goods and services on a sustainable level. The term ecosystem can also pertain to human-made environments, such as human ecosystems and human- influenced ecosystems, and can describe any situation where there is relationship between living organisms and their environment. Fewer areas on the surface of the earth today exist free from human contact, although some genuine wilderness areas continue to exist without any forms of human intervention. Biomes Map of terrestrial biomes classified by vegetation Biomes are terminologically similar to the concept of ecosystems, and are climatically and geographically defined areas of ecologically similar climatic conditions on the Earth, such as communities of plants, animals, and soil organisms, often referred to as ecosystems. Biomes are defined on the basis of factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike ecozones, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of ecological succession and climax vegetation. Biogeochemical cycles Chloroplasts conduct photosynthesis and are found in plant cells and other eukaryotic organisms. These are chloroplasts visible in the cells of Plagiomnium affine ‚Äî many-fruited thyme-moss. Global biogeochemical cycles are critical to life, most notably those of water, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus.Smil, V. (2000). Cycles of Life. New York: Scientific American Library. . * The nitrogen cycle is the transformation of nitrogen and nitrogen-containing compounds in nature. It is a cycle which includes gaseous components. * The water cycle, is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. Water can change states among liquid, vapour, and ice at various places in the water cycle. Although the balance of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time, individual water molecules can come and go. * The carbon cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth. * The oxygen cycle is the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for the modern Earth's atmospheric composition and life. * The phosphorus cycle is the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. The atmosphere does not play a significant role in the movements of phosphorus, because phosphorus and phosphorus compounds are usually solids at the typical ranges of temperature and pressure found on Earth. Wilderness conifer forest in the Swiss Alps (National Park) The Ahklun Mountains and the Togiak Wilderness within the Togiak National Wildlife Refuge in the U.S. state of Alaska Wilderness is generally defined as a natural environment on Earth that has not been significantly modified by human activity. The WILD Foundation goes into more detail, defining wilderness as: \\"The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planet ‚Äì those last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure.\\" Wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, solitude, and recreation. Wilderness is deeply valued for cultural, spiritual, moral, and aesthetic reasons. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity. The word, \\"wilderness\\", derives from the notion of wildness; in other words that which is not controllable by humans. The word's etymology is from the Old English wildeornes, which in turn derives from wildeor meaning wild beast (wild + deor = beast, deer).wilderness. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary ‚Äì Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved November 29, 2012. From this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being \\"wilderness.\\" Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered \\"wild.\\" This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without very noticeable human interference. Wildlife includes all non-domesticated plants, animals and other organisms. Domesticating wild plant and animal species for human benefit has occurred many times all over the planet, and has a major impact on the environment, both positive and negative. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, rain forests, plains, and other areas‚Äîincluding the most developed urban sites‚Äîall have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by civilized human factors, most scientists agree that wildlife around the world is (now) impacted by human activities. A view of wilderness in Estonia Challenges Before flue-gas desulfurization was installed, the air- polluting emissions from this power plant in New Mexico contained excessive amounts of sulfur dioxide. Amazon rainforest in Brazil. The tropical rainforests of South America contain the largest diversity of species on Earth, including some that have evolved within the past few hundred thousand years. It is the common understanding of natural environment that underlies environmentalism ‚Äî a broad political, social, and philosophical movement that advocates various actions and policies in the interest of protecting what nature remains in the natural environment, or restoring or expanding the role of nature in this environment. While true wilderness is increasingly rare, wild nature (e.g., unmanaged forests, uncultivated grasslands, wildlife, wildflowers) can be found in many locations previously inhabited by humans. Goals for the benefit of people and natural systems, commonly expressed by environmental scientists and environmentalists include: * Elimination of pollution and toxicants in air, water, soil, buildings, manufactured goods, and food. * Preservation of biodiversity and protection of endangered species. * Conservation and sustainable use of resources such as water, land, air, energy, raw materials, and natural resources. * Halting human-induced global warming, which represents pollution, a threat to biodiversity, and a threat to human populations. * Shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy in electricity, heating and cooling, and transportation, which addresses pollution, global warming, and sustainability. This may include public transportation and distributed generation, which have benefits for traffic congestion and electric reliability. * Shifting from meat-intensive diets to largely plant-based diets in order to help mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change. * Establishment of nature reserves for recreational purposes and ecosystem preservation. * Sustainable and less polluting waste management including waste reduction (or even zero waste), reuse, recycling, composting, waste-to-energy, and anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge. *Reducing profligate consumption and clamping down on illegal fishing and logging. *Slowing and stabilisation of human population growth. Criticism In some cultures the term environment is meaningless because there is no separation between people and what they view as the natural world, or their surroundings.Jamieson, Dale.

She is known for her writing on women's oppression and criticism of religion, despite forced exile. . Some of her books are banned in Bangladesh. She has been blacklisted and banished from the Bengal region (both from Bangladesh and West Bengal). Nasrin was born to Dr. Rajab Ali and Edul Ara in Mymensingh. Her father was a physician, and a professor of Medical Jurisprudence in Mymensingh Medical College, also at Sir Salimullah Medical College, Dhaka and Dhaka Medical College. Nasrin studied medicine and became a physician. She gained global attention by the beginning of 1990s owing to her essays and novels with feminist views and criticism of what she characterizes as all \\"misogynistic\\" religions including Islam. Nasrin has been living in exile since 1994. After living more than a decade in Europe and the United States, she moved to India in 2004, but was banished from the country in 2008,\\"I am a Bengali writer, I need to live in Bengal\\" Open the Magazine, 2011-June-1 although she has been staying in Kolkata, India on a resident permit long-term, multiple-entry or 'X' visa since 2004.

Retrieved 5 June 2019 She has been unable to return either to her home in Bangladesh or to her adopted home of West Bengal, India. She now lives in New Delhi, India. Early career After high school in 1976 (SSC) and higher secondary studies in college (HSC) in 1978, she studied medicine at the Mymensingh Medical College, an affiliated medical college of the University of Dhaka and graduated in 1984 with an MBBS degree. In college, she wrote and edited a poetry journal called Shenjuti. After graduation, she worked at a family planning clinic in Mymensingh, then practised at the gynaecology department of Mitford hospital and at the anaesthesia department of Dhaka Medical College hospital. While she studied and practised medicine, she saw girls who had been raped; she also heard women cry out in despair in the delivery room if their baby was a girl. She was born into a Muslim family; however, she became an atheist over time. In the course of writing she took a feminist approach. Literary career Early in her literary career, Nasrin wrote mainly poetry, and published half a dozen collections of poetry between 1982 and 1993, often with female oppression as a theme, and often containing very graphic language. She started publishing prose in the late 1980s, and produced three collections of essays and four novels before the publication of her documentary novel Lajja ( L√¥jja), or Shame, in which a Hindu family was being attacked by Muslim fanatics and decided to leave the country. Nasrin suffered a number of physical and other attacks for her critical scrutiny of Islam and her demand for women's equality. Many of her opposers took to the streets demanding her execution by hanging. In October 1993, a radical fundamentalist group called the Council of Islamic Soldiers offered a bounty for her death. In May 1994 she was interviewed by the Kolkata edition of The Statesman, which quoted her as calling for a revision of the Quran; she claims she only called for abolition of the Sharia, the Islamic religious law. In August 1994 she was brought up on \\"charges of making inflammatory statements,\\" and faced criticism from Islamic fundamentalists. A few hundred thousand demonstrators called her \\"an apostate appointed by imperial forces to vilify Islam\\"; a member of a \\"militant faction threatened to set loose thousands of poisonous snakes in the capital unless she was executed.\\" After spending two months in hiding, at the end of 1994 she escaped to Sweden, consequently ceasing her medical practice and becoming a full-time writer and activist. Life in exile After fleeing Bangladesh in 1994, Nasrin spent the next ten years in exile in Sweden, Germany, France and the US. She returned to the East and relocated to Kolkata, India, in 2004, where she lived until 2007. After she was physically attacked by Muslim opposers in Hyderabad, she was forced to live under house arrest in Kolkata and finally she was made to leave West Bengal on 22 November 2007. She was then forced to live under house arrest in Delhi for 3 months. She had no other alternative but to leave India in 2008. She was not allowed to live in India for a while, but ultimately Nasrin, determined to live in the subcontinent, moved to India from the US. Leaving Bangladesh towards the end of 1994, Nasrin lived in exile in Western Europe and North America for ten years. Her Bangladeshi passport had been revoked; she was granted citizenship by the Swedish government and took refuge in Germany. She allegedly had to wait for six years (1994‚Äì1999) to get a visa to visit India. In 1998 she wrote Meyebela, My Bengali Girlhood, her biographical account from birth to adolescence. She never got a Bangladeshi passport to return to the country when her mother, and later her father, were on their death beds. In March 2000, she visited Mumbai to promote a translation of her novel Shodh (translated by Marathi author Ashok Shahane, the book was called Phitam Phat). Secular \\"atheist\\" groups seized upon the occasion to celebrate freedom of expression, while \\"radical fundamentalist groups...threatened to burn her alive.\\" 2004‚Äì2007, life in Kolkata In 2004, she was granted a renewable temporary residential permit by India and moved to Kolkata in the state of West Bengal, which shares a common heritage and language with Bangladesh; in an interview in 2007, after she had been forced to flee, she called Kolkata her home. The government of India extended her visa to stay in the country on a periodic basis, though it refused to grant her Indian citizenship. While living in Kolkata, Nasrin regularly contributed to Indian newspapers and magazines, including Anandabazar Patrika and Desh, and, for some time, wrote a weekly column in the Bengali version of The Statesman. Again her criticism of Islam was met with opposition from religious fundamentalists: in June 2006, Syed Noorur Rehaman Barkati, the imam of Kolkata's Tipu Sultan Mosque, admitted offering money to anyone who \\"blackened [that is, publicly humiliated] Ms Nasreen's face.\\" Even abroad she caused controversy: in 2005, she tried to read an anti-war poem titled \\"America\\" to a large Bengali crowd at the North American Bengali Conference at Madison Square Garden in New York City, and was booed off the stage. Back in India, the \\"All India Muslim Personal Board (Jadeed)\\" offered 500,000 rupees for her beheading in March 2007. The group's president, Tauqeer Raza Khan, said the only way the bounty would be lifted was if Nasrin \\"apologises, burns her books and leaves.\\" In 2007, elected and serving members of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen made threats against Tasleema Nasreen, pledging that the fatwa against her and Salman Rushdie were to be abided by. While she was in Hyderabad releasing Telugu translations of her work, she was attacked by party members led by 3 MLAs- Mohammed Muqtada Khan, Mohammed Moazzam Khan and Syed Ahmed Pasha Quadri - were then charged and arrested. Expulsion from Kolkata On 9 August 2007, Nasrin was in Hyderabad to present the Telugu translation of one of her novels, Shodh, when she was allegedly attacked by a mob, allegedly led by legislators from the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, an Indian political party. A week later, on 17 August, Muslim leaders in Kolkata revived an old fatwa against her, urging her to leave the country and offering an unlimited amount of money to anybody who would kill her. On 21 November, Kolkata witnessed a protest against Nasrin. A protest organised by the militant islamist \\"All India Minority Forum\\" caused chaos in the city and forced the army's deployment to restore order. After the riots, Nasrin was forced to move from Kolkata, her \\"adopted city,\\" to Jaipur, and to New Delhi the following day. The government of India kept Nasrin in an undisclosed location in New Delhi, effectively under house arrest, for more than seven months. In January 2008, she was selected for the Simone de Beauvoir award in recognition of her writing on women's rights, but declined to go to Paris to receive the award. She explained that \\"I don't want to leave India at this stage and would rather fight for my freedom here,\\" but she had to be hospitalised for three days with several complaints. The house arrest quickly acquired an international dimension: in a letter to London-based human rights organisation Amnesty International, India's former foreign secretary Muchkund Dubey urged the organisation to pressure the Indian government so Nasrin could safely return to Kolkata. From New Delhi, Nasrin commented: \\"I'm writing a lot, but not about Islam, It's not my subject now. This is about politics. In the last three months I have been put under severe pressure to leave [West] Bengal by the police.\\" In an email interview from the undisclosed safehouse, Nasrin talked about the stress caused by \\"this unendurable loneliness, this uncertainty and this deathly silence.\\" She cancelled the publication of the sixth part of her autobiography Nei Kichu Nei (\\"No Entity\\"), and‚Äîunder pressure‚Äîdeleted some passages from Dwikhandito, the controversial book that was the boost for the riots in Kolkata. She was forced to leave India on 19 March 2008. Nasrin moved to Sweden in 2008 and later worked as a research scholar at New York University. Since, as she claims, \\"her soul lived in India,\\" she also pledged her body to the country, by awarding it for posthumous medical use to Gana Darpan, a Kolkata-based NGO, in 2005. She eventually returned to India, but was forced to stay in New Delhi as the West Bengal government refused to permit her entry.. Currently her visa received a one-year extension in 2016 and Nasreen is also seeking permanent residency in India but no decision has been taken on it by the Home Ministry In 2015 Nasrin was supposedly threatened with death by Al Qaeda-linked extremists, and so the Center for Inquiry assisted her in traveling to the United States, where she now lives. The Center for Inquiry (CFI) that helped evacuate her to the U.S. on 27 May gave an official statement in June 2015 stating that her safety \\"is only temporary if she cannot remain in the U.S., however, which is why CFI has established an emergency fund to help with food, housing, and the means for her to be safely settled\\". Literary works Nasrin started writing poetry when she was thirteen. While still at college in Mymensingh, she published and edited a literary magazine, SeNjuti (\\"Light in the dark\\"), from 1978 to 1983. She published her first collection of poems in 1986. Her second collection, Nirbashito Bahire Ontore (\\"Banished within and without\\") was published in 1989. She succeeded in attracting a wider readership when she started writing columns in late 1980s, and, in the early 1990s, she began writing novels, for which she has won significant acclaim. In all, she has written more than thirty books of poetry, essays, novels, short stories, and memoirs, and her books have been translated into 20 different languages. Her own experience of sexual abuse during adolescence and her work as a gynaecologist influenced her a great deal in writing about the alleged treatment of women in Islam and against religion in general. Her writing is characterised by two connected elements: her struggle with the Islam of her native culture, and her feminist philosophy. She cites Virginia Woolf and Simone de Beauvoir as influences, and, when pushed to think of one closer to home, Begum Rokeya, who lived during the time of undivided Bengal. Her later poetry also evidences a connection to place, to Bangladesh and India. Columns and essays In 1989 Nasrin began to contribute to the weekly political magazine Khaborer Kagoj, edited by Nayeemul Islam Khan, and published from Dhaka. Her feminist views and anti-religion remarks articles succeeded in drawing broad attention, and she shocked the religious and conservative society of Bangladesh by her radical comments and suggestions. Later she collected these columns in a volume titled Nirbachita Column, which in 1992 won her first Ananda Purashkar award, a prestigious award for Bengali writers. During her life in Kolkata, she contributed a weekly essay to the Bengali version of The Statesman, called Dainik Statesman. Taslima has always advocated for an Indian Uniform civil code, and said that criticism of Islam is the only way to establish secularism in Islamic countries. Taslima said that Triple talaq is despicable and the All India Muslim Personal Law Board should be abolished. Taslima used to write articles for online media venture The Print in India. Novels In 1992 Nasrin produced two novellas which failed to draw attention. Her breakthrough novel Lajja (Shame) was published in 1993, and attracted wide attention because of its controversial subject matter. It contained the struggle of a patriotic Bangladeshi Hindu family in a Muslim environment. Initially written as a thin documentary, Lajja grew into a full-length novel as the author later revised it substantially. In six months' time, it sold 50,000 copies in Bangladesh before being banned by the government that same year. Her other famous novel is French Lover, published in 2002. Autobiography Her memoirs are renowned for their candidness, which has led to a number of them being banned in Bangladesh and India. Amar Meyebela (My Girlhood, 2002), the first volume of her memoir, was banned by the Bangladeshi government in 1999 for \\"reckless comments\\" against Islam and the prophet Mohammad. Utal Hawa (Wild Wind), the second part of her memoir, was banned by the Bangladesh government in 2002. Ka (Speak up), the third part of her memoir, was banned by the Bangladeshi High Court in 2003. Under pressure from Indian Muslim activists, the book, which was published in West Bengal as Dwikhandita, was banned there also; some 3,000 copies were seized immediately. The decision to ban the book was criticised by \\"a host of authors\\" in West Bengal, but the ban was not lifted until 2005. Sei Sob Ondhokar (Those Dark Days), the fourth part of her memoir, was banned by the Bangladesh government in 2004. To date, a total of seven parts of her autobiography have been published. \\"Ami bhalo nei tumi bhalo theko priyo desh\\", \\" Nei kichu nei\\" and \\"Nirbashito\\". All seven parts have been published by Peoples's Book Society, Kolkata. She received her second Ananda Purashkar award in 2000, for her memoir Amar Meyebela (My Girlhood, published in English in 2002). Nasrin's life and works in adaptation Nasrin's life is the subject of a number of plays and songs, in the east and the west. The Swedish singer Magoria sang \\"Goddess in you, Taslima,\\" and the French band Zebda composed \\"Don't worry, Taslima\\" as an homage. Her work has been adapted for TV and even turned into music. Jhumur was a 2006 TV serial based on a story written especially for the show. Bengali singers like Fakir Alamgir, Samina Nabi, Rakhi Sen sang her songs. Steve Lacy, the jazz soprano saxophonist, met Nasrin in 1996 and collaborated with her on an adaptation of her poetry to music. The result, a \\"controversial\\" and \\"compelling\\" work called The Cry, was performed in Europe and North America. Initially, Nasrin was to recite during the performance, but these recitations were dropped after the 1996 Berlin world premiere because of security concerns. Writers and intellectuals for and against Nasrin Nasrin has been criticised by writers and intellectuals in both Bangladesh and West Bengal for targeted scandalisation. Because of \\"obnoxious, false and ludicrous\\" comments in Ka, \\"written with the 'intention to injure the reputation of the plaintiff'\\", Syed Shamsul Haq, Bangladeshi poet and novelist, filed a defamation suit against Nasrin in 2003. In the book, she mentions that Haq confessed to her that he had a relationship with his sister-in-law. A West Bengali poet, Hasmat Jalal, did the same; his suit led to the High Court banning the book, which was published in India as Dwikhondito. Nearly 4 million dollars were claimed in defamation lawsuits against her after the book was published. The West Bengal Government, supposedly pressured by 24 literary intellectuals, decided to ban Nasreen's book in 2003. Nasrin replied that she wrote about known people without their permission when some commented that she did it to earn fame. She defended herself against all the allegations. She wrote why she dared to reveal her sexual activities, saying that she wrote her life's story, not others'. Yet Nasrin enjoyed support from Bengali writers and intellectuals like Annada Shankar Ray, Sibnarayan Ray and Amlan Dutta. Recently she was supported and defended by personalities such as author Mahasweta Devi, theatre director Bibhas Chakrabarty, poet Joy Goswami, artist Prakash Karmakar and Paritosh Sen. In India, noted writers Arundhati Roy, Girish Karnad, and others defended her when she was under house arrest in Delhi in 2007, and co-signed a statement calling on the Indian government to grant her permanent residency in India or, should she ask for it, citizenship. In Bangladesh writer and philosopher Kabir Chowdhury also supported her strongly. Political views When Sri Lanka banned the burka on 2019, Taslima took to Twitter to show her support for the decision. She termed burqa as a 'mobile prison'. Taslima has echoed the views of eugenicists on Twitter, stating that those with \\"bad genes\\" (for which she lists diabetes, hypertension, and cancer) should not reproduce.

It includes the culture that the individual was educated or lives in, and the people and institutions with whom they interact. The interaction may be in person or through communication media, even anonymous or one-way,Marjorie Taylor, Imaginary Companions (1999) p. 147 and may not imply equality of social status. The social environment is a broader concept than that of social class or social circle. The physical and social environment is a determining factor in active and healthy aging in place, being a central factor in the study of environmental gerontology. Solidarity People with the same social environment often develop a sense of social solidarity; people often tend to trust and help one another, and to congregate in social groups. They will often think in similar styles and patterns, even though the conclusions which they reach may differ. Natural/artificial environment In order to enrich their lives, people have used natural resources and in the process have brought about many changes in the natural environment. Human settlements, roads, farmlands, dams and many other things have all developed through this type of process. All these man- made components are included in our cultural environment, Erving Goffman in particular stressing the deeply social nature of the individual environment.Erving Goffman, Relations in Public (1972) p. 296 Milieu/social structure C. Wright Mills contrasted the immediate milieu of jobs/family/neighborhood with the wider formations of the social structure, highlighting in particular a distinction between \\"the personal troubles of milieu\\" and the \\"public crises of social structure\\".Quoted in Peter Worsley ed., The New Modern Sociology Readings (1991) p. 17 Emile Durkheim took a wider view of the social environment (milieu social), arguing that it contained internalized expectations and representations of social forces/social facts:P.

It is situated on the boundary of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham and the London Borough of Redbridge, around west of Romford and east of Ilford, and north-east of Charing Cross. The name was first used in the 17th century for a settlement in the parish of Dagenham in Essex, which later absorbed the neighbouring hamlet of Chadwell Street in the parish of Barking (later Ilford). Chadwell Heath railway station, on the Great Eastern Main Line, opened in 1864, connecting the area to Central London. After the First World War, the area developed as a residential suburb and formed the northern limit of the Becontree estate, causing an increase in population density. The area became part of Greater London in 1965. The area is home to the Chadwell Heath Academy. It was the final residence of Eva Hart, a survivor of the , and a local pub is named after her. History Toponymy The name 'Chadwell' is first recorded in 1254 as Chaudewell and means 'the cold spring'. The name was first applied to a settlement on the Barking (later Ilford) side of the ancient boundary between Dagenham and Barking and it was also known as Chadwell Street; 'Street' having the older meaning of a hamlet. In the 17th century the Blackheath Common in Dagenham parish was renamed Chadwell Heath. As the settlements merged the Chadwell Street name was lost in favour of Chadwell Heath. Economic development The railway was constructed through the area from Romford and Ilford and in 1864 Chadwell Heath railway station was opened. It was the 'end of the line' for both the London tram system and later the electric trolley bus service from Aldgate. The trolley buses turned around at Station Road and Wangey Road. Local government A map showing the wards of Barking Civil Parish as they appeared in 1871. Chadwell Heath formed a hamlet in the ancient parish of Dagenham, Essex. As Chadwell Heath grew it absorbed the neighbouring hamlet of Chadwell Street in the Chadwell ward of the parish of Barking.'London Gazetteer', Russ Willey, (2006), Harrap Publishers The Barking section of Chadwell Heath became part of the new parish of Ilford in 1888. This became Ilford Urban District in 1894. The Dagenham section became part of Romford Rural District in 1894. The parish was removed from the rural district and became Dagenham Urban District in 1926. During the 1920s and 1930s the local government arrangements of the area came under review and various proposals would have merged the two sections of Chadwell Heath into a single district, however this was not acted upon. Ilford was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1926 and Dagenham was incorporated in 1938. The arrangements of the area were reviewed again in the 1950s and 1960s. The whole area was considered to form part of the Greater London conurbation and in 1957 formed part of the review area of the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London. Following the review, in 1965 the London Government Act 1963 abolished the municipal boroughs of Dagenham and Ilford, and transferred their former area from Essex to Greater London, to form part of the new London Borough of Barking and the London Borough of Redbridge. Urban development The London to Colchester Roman Road caused some early 'ribbon' development while much of the rest of the area remained rural. Suburban growth commenced in 1900 and proceeded rapidly until World War I; increasing after the war. The area suffered several bomb hits during World War Two. A large parachute mine also exploded causing extensive residential damage in Bennett Road, destroying the school, while a second failed to explode and its parachute became entangled in horse-chestnut trees near Chadwell Heath station. It did not explode because it was cradled in very soft soil as the result of digging near Hemmings Bakery. It was found by Walter Wiffen, a train guard from Cedar Park Gardens on his way to work at the station early the next morning. He reported it at the police station, which is now the Eva Hart pub, and oversaw the evacuation of Cedar Park Gardens to the bomb shelter at the corner of Wangey Road and the High Road. A V2 rocket landed on Blackbush Avenue killing several people and blowing out windows for half a mile around. Later, the local council replaced the windows with much more modern frames, and the results provided an incongruous look to the older house designs. A heavy anti-aircraft battery was located east of Whalebone Lane North and traces of the concrete emplacements remain today. A V2 Rocket destroyed two houses in Woodlands Avenue and damaged the houses that had been repaired after the landmine that had destroyed the Whalebone Junior school in Bennett Road. Governance Chadwell Heath is split between the Chadwell ward in the London Borough of Redbridge and the Chadwell Heath and Whalebone wards in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, electing councillors to Barking and Dagenham London Borough Council and Redbridge London Borough Council.Barking & Dagenham London Borough Council - Borough , Chadwell Heath ward and Chadwell ward maps Demography In the 2011 census, the combined wards of Chadwell in Redbridge and Chadwell Heath in Barking and Dagenham had a total population of 24,278 people. The two combined wards had no single ethnic majority, with the largest group being White British people comprising 44.3% of the population. The next largest groups were Indians (9.5%), Black Africans (9.3%), Black Caribbeans (5.7%), Bangladeshis (5.6%), Pakistanis (5.5%) and Other Whites (5.2%). Geography The London Borough of Havering is to the east. Many major buildings, such as the local school and former police station (now the popular pub, the Eva Hart) actually lie in the London Borough of Redbridge. Royal Mail includes Chadwell Heath as part of a postcode district (RM6) of the Romford post town,Royal Mail, Address Management Guide, (2004) however the town of Romford is in Havering. The area has three allotments. One adjacent to St Chad's Park on Alexandra Road, another on Chadwell Heath Lane and a plot in Little Heath next to the Eastern Avenue / A12 (next to the Hargreaves Scout centre). Economy Hemmings once had an enormous bakery building on land just north of Chadwell Heath station. This building was derelict by the 1970s and was later demolished for housing. For many years Bergermaster Paints maintained a large factory in Freshwater Road. Grove Road was also an industrial area with Wiggins Teape and Morganite Carbons Ltd among companies based there. These sites were sold in the 1990s and have also been redeveloped for housing. A teddy bear factory in the same area was the site of the alleged murder of Terry 'Teddy Bear' Eve and others in the 1970s. The esoteric publishing company founded by phrenologist L.N. Fowler had a shop and offices in the High Road in the 1970s and 1980s. Dairy Crest is a major employer in the area and Sunlight laundry Sainsbury's, Nicholls and Clarke, and Tesco are also major employers. Transport Chadwell Heath is served by London Buses services and TfL Rail at Chadwell Heath railway station which is currently being upgraded as part of the Crossrail Project. It has easy rail access to Liverpool Street Station in the City of London. London Buses routes that serve Chadwell Heath are the 62 from Marks Gate 'Billet Road' to Barking 'Gascoigne Estate'; 86 from Romford Station to Stratford Station; 173 from King George Hospital 'Goodmayes' to Beckton Station; 362 from King George Hospital 'Goodmayes' to Grange Hill Station; 368 from Chadwell Heath 'Police Station' to Barking 'Harts Lane' and night bus N86 from Stratford Station to Harold Hill 'Dagnam Park Square'. Embassy Cinema Embassy Cinema There is a former art deco cinema on Chadwell Heath High Road, built in May 1934, and was originally called the Embassy Cinema; later it became part of the Gaumont British Circuit. During the late 1960s, it was converted into a Bingo Hall - known to many locals as the Mecca Bingo Hall Mecca Bingo,. Recently, the building was listed as an Asset of Community Value by the 'Chadwell Heath South Residents' Association' in August 2017. Religion The Roman Catholic Church, St Bede's, is on Bishops Avenue, RM6 5RS, and forms part of the overall site of St Bede's Roman Catholic primary school (main entrance on Canon Avenue). St Chad's Church (Church of England) stands on St Chad's Road, next to the White Horse public House. Chadwell Heath has two baptist churches; one is found in the town centre on the High Road opposite Sainsbury's; the other in East Road at its junction with Havering Gardens. Other churches include the United Reformed Church (URC), and the Brethren Assembly in Wangey Road. Many Sikhs utilise the gurdwara in Goodmayes (Singh Sabha Seven Kings) There are nearby Hindu temples in Ilford. There are nearby synagogues in Ilford and Romford, which Chadwell Heath Jewish residents can and do use. There are mosques in the locality. Sport West Ham United's training ground was located in the area until late 2015. On 10 December 2015, Slaven Bilic, then West Ham manager, announced that from 14 December the club would be moving from the old training ground (at Saville Road) to the new training ground at nearby Rush Green. Similar to many parts of East London, the area has a large \\"Hammers\\" following. A number of famous sports people hail from the area. Former England rugby union legend Jason Leonard is from Chadwell Heath, and attended the town's Warren Comprehensive School. Former England and West Ham United player Tony Cottee and former WBO world boxing champion Colin McMillan also attended Warren Comprehensive School. Portsmouth defender Nicky Shorey also went to the Chadwell Heath Foundation School. Boxer Frank Bruno, Cricketer Graham Gooch and Darts player Bobby George lived here, as well as footballers Mark Lazarus and Mark Lazaridos (Leyton Orient). Former F1 driver Keith Jack \\"Jackie\\" Oliver was born here on 14 August 1942. Jim Peters, the marathon runner who gained worldwide fame when he collapsed and was unable to finish the marathon in the 1954 Empire Games in Vancouver, Canada, lived in Chadwell Heath during the 1950s. There are two lawn bowls clubs in the area, 'Barley Bowls' and 'St Chad's Bowls Club'. The area is home to a private lawn tennis club 'Mike Ellames'. Adjacent to Warren Comprenhensive on Whalebone Lane there is a golf driving range. Notable people Mary Wollstonecraft (born 1759), mother of Frankenstein author Mary Shelley, lived briefly at a farm near Whalebone Lane until the family moved to Barking. Wollstonecraft wrote A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in 1792 and was a notable critic of the Whig MP Edmund Burke. A number of photographs of Mary can be seen in the Eva Hart pub. Artist Henry Gillard Glindoni (1852‚Äì1913) moved to Chadwell Heath around 1891 and lived in a new villa on the corner of Mill Lane and Whalebone Lane North. This building is still there and his north-facing studio adjacent to the house is now a small shop. He painted local scenes and some of his work can still be seen in Valence House Museum. A survivor of the , Eva Hart MBE, was a resident of Japan Road, Chadwell Heath, for many years until her death in 1996. Hart was a magistrate who dealt with alcohol licence applications. When the former police station was converted into a public house by Wetherspoon's, it was named after her and remains so today. It contains several photographs of young Eva and her family. Immediately following the tragedy she and her mother lived with her grandmother in Whalebone Grove. Apart from a short stay in Australia, she was a lifelong Chadwell Heath resident; her funeral at St. Chad's church was packed because she was well known in the area. Actress and singer Millicent Martin was born in Mill Lane in 1934 and went to school in Romford. She became famous for appearances in That Was The Week That Was and Sunday Night at the London Palladium on UK TV in the 1960s. Most recently she has played Daphne's mother in the US series Frasier. Fishmonger Eric Ruffell ran a shop in High Road, Chadwell Heath. For many years he held the Royal Warrant as supplier to HM The Queen by appointment. He also continued to price his fish in pounds shillings and pence for some time after decimalization and became a local cause celebre through his appearance on the TV programme Nationwide. The shop was demolished during commercial redevelopment in the 1980s. Author Michael J Merry (The Golden Altar, The Reluctant Colonel, The Education of Santiago O‚ÄôGrady, \\"Guten tag, Mr. Churchill\\") lived in Hall Road between 1940 and 1958.

National Museum of China The zun or yi, used until the Northern Song (960‚Äì1126) is a type of Chinese ritual bronze or ceramic wine vessel with a round or square vase-like form, sometimes in the shape of an animal,http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/30Arts2059.html first appearing in the Shang dynasty. Used in religious ceremonies to hold wine, the zun has a wide lip to facilitate pouring. Vessels have been found in the shape of a dragon, an ox, a goose, and more. One notable zun is the He zun () from the Western Zhou. Function and use The zun is a vessel used as a ritual container to hold wine in ancient Chinese. It is a tall wine cup, with no handles or legs. The mouth of the vessel is normally seen as broader than the rest of the body. As a ritual container, its function is to provide the offering of wine to the deceased through ceremonial practices. Depending on the type of zun vessel, for example the Xi zun, not only was it used to store wine but also used to keep the wine warm. This is the only bronze piece discovered known to combine the two functions.http://arts.cultural- china.com/en/69Arts7435.html Symbolism The zun comes in various shapes, notably as a round or square vase-like form. Through these forms they appear in unique shapes varying different animals. Often, these vessels are found with distinctive and defined decor with unique symbolism. The most noticeable symbol through the decor is the taotie, known as the demon-face or the face of a sacrificial animal in early Chinese art. This type of face is a common motif found in Chinese ritual bronzes during the Shang dynasty. It has also been defined as a mask, vividly shown as two symmetrical bodies that are joined together. The most visible feature of the mask on the vessel is the protruding animal eyes projecting from the bronze surface in which stares at the viewer. These protruding eyes has also been defined as the eyes of a predator. These animal designs are also iconographically meaningful as the images of the various animals that served as the helpers of shamans and shamanesses (who were believed to have mythical powers) in the tasks of Heaven-Earth, and with the dead-living communication. Ceramic forms The zun can be seen in a variety of different vessel forms from a limited amount of decoration to detailed. Some are square, some cylindrical while others are modeled after animals. Some of the animals they are modeled after are an elephant, ox, sheep, horse, rhinoceros and a bird. The basic shape used throughout many is cylindrical and the shape itself is repeated but with modifications. Some Zuns are tall and slender while others may be short and round. The decoration used on the vessels varies not only in content but the relief height. The height of the relief may give off the impression of texture or it may emphasize the form of the vessel by being smooth and round like the vessel. The taller vessel forms may have flanges on the sides that start at the upper lip and follow down to the foot of the vessel. Historical and cultural references Some characteristics of early Shang zuns consisted of a flaring mouth, high neck and a large body. Shang zuns also had wide shoulders and a foot ring. During the early Western Zhou, there was a zun modeled after a gu but was thicker, larger and the body portion is swelled more than that of a gu. Flanges appear on the vessels body and neck while the same decoration is used. The shoulders consist of small animal heads. Late Shang to Early Zhou Zuns are slim. The flanges start from the mouth of the vessel and down the body ending before the foot ring. The flanges are identical showing symmetry. Early Western Zhou zun are shorter, rounder and smoother. The relief of the vessel emphasizes the form removing the flanges. The bird motif is more prominent now than in the previous vessels. Important examples Four-goat Square Zun :Period: Shang Dynasty :Overall Height: 58.3 cm :Weight: 34 kg :Location: National Museum of China, Beijing right The square zun was excavated in 1938 from Yueshanpu, Ningxiang, Hunan Province. It has a generous mouth with a flared flat lip, a long neck, projecting shoulder, shallow belly and high ring foot. There are flanges on the four corners and in the middle of all four sides. The neck has a design of triangular one-legged dragons and the flanges become the noses of the animal face designs below, with curly horns, round protruding eyes and a scrolled tail. On the shoulder are high-relief designs of dragons with their three-dimensional heads on the centre and their bodies wriggling along the sides. On the four corners of the shoulder are four protruding rams‚Äô heads with curly horns, the belly of the vessel forming their chests and their legs extending down the ring foot. Their heads have engraved thunder patterns while there are scales on their chests and backs. Both sides are decorated with an elegant design of a bird with a high crest. The ring foot also carries a design of one-legged dragons. This vessel combines the techniques of engraving, high relief and three-dimensional relief in a dignified and refined form with intricately worked designs. It is a perfect fusion of moulding and artistic design representing the very best of bronze-making by the traditional clay mould technique. Fu Hao owl-shaped Zun :Period: Late Shang Dynasty :Overall Height: 46.3 cm :Mouth Wide: 16.1 cm :Location: National Museum of China, Beijing It was excavated in 1976 from the tomb of Fu Hao, Anyang, Henan Province. This bronze wine vessel with the design of owl, a ferocious bird, belongs to those with bird and beast designs. The whole vessel uses thunder pattern as the background, the beak and breast carry cicada pattern, the two sides of the neck carry the Kui pattern (Kui is a legendary dragon with one horn and one foot), the wings carry snake pattern and the tail has the design of a flying owl. The whole piece has rich, delicate and diverse patterns. In appearance, this owl looks solemn and powerful with its two legs and tail form a triangle support the vessel. The shape is firm and lifelike. It is a perfect combination of plane and three-dimensional designs. Inside the vessel's mouth are two inscribed characters ‚ÄúFuhao‚Äù, the name of a woman. The oracle inscriptions during the reign of the King Wuding of the Shang Dynasty have many records about this woman. Being the wife of the king, Fuhao involved herself in major state affairs, participated in wars, and presided over sacrificial ceremonies. She led troops to conquer many parts of the country, thus enjoying an illustrious status and being a legendary figure. Dragon and tiger Zun :Period: Late Shang Dynasty :Overall Height: 50.5 cm :Diameter at mouth: 44.7cm, Diameter at foot: 24 cm It was excavated in 1957 from Yueyahe, Funan, Anhui Province. This is a tall and large zun, with a trumpet-shaped mouth, girded neck, broad sloping shoulder, belly which narrows at the bottom, and a high ring foot. The neck is decorated with three narrow bands, the shoulder with three protruding wriggling dragons with upright conical horns, open mouths, extended bodies and coiled tail. Behind their tails is another small dragon design. The belly has a design of a tiger, with raised head in high relief and bodies in shallower relief, extending on both sides of the head. Below the tiger's head is a squatting man with arms raised above his shoulders, his head inside the jaw of the tiger. Below both designs is an animal face design with the corner flange of the vessel forming its nose, T-shaped horns and a scrolled tail. The ring foot has three cross-shaped piercings and, on the lower part, animal face designs. The mixture of the techniques of engraving, high relief and three-dimensional relief on the shoulder and belly combined with the delicate and beautiful designs make this a masterpiece of Shang bronze work. In ancient times, non-Chinese peoples lived in Huaiyi Region, where this piece was excavated, and it shows the influence of Shang bronzes combined with local features. Ritual wine container (zun) with masks, dragons, and birds :Period: Late Shang dynasty, Middle Anyang period, ca. 12th century B.C.E. :Overall Height: 36.6 cm :Wide: 37.4 cm :Weight: 34 kg :Location: Freer Gallery of Art F1951.19 This example probably excavated from Anyang, Henan province, China. And it used to belong to C.T. Loo & Co., New York, from at least May 11, 1949. Then Freer Gallery of Art purchased it from C. T. Loo on November 28, 1951. Zun with dragons :Period: Western Zhou Dynasty :Overall Height: 20.5 cm :Wide: 17.5 cm :Location: Freer Gallery of Art F1911.40, purchased from C.T. Loo on December 8, 1943 He zun :Period: Western Zhou :Overall Height: 38.8 cm :Weight: 14.6 kg :Location: Baoji Museum, Shaanxi 250px He Zun, renowned for the written characters meaning \\"Middle Kingdom\\", that is, \\"China\\" () in a bronze inscription on the bottom, is one of the most important and well-known Chinese bronze vessels of the Western Zhou. It was discovered by chance and its value hadn't been recognized for a long time after it was unearthed. Now He Zun is one of the precious cultural relics which can never be exhibited overseas as expressly provided by Chinese government. This vessel describes the establishment of a royal residence at the new capital five years after King Cheng assumed the throne. The inscription, which is unclear in parts, was composed by He, who received a speech and gifts from the King. We do not know who his father was nor what role he played in the Zhou conquest, but it is possible that He and his lineage were originally not members of the Zhou tribe. The inscription is particularly interesting in that it demonstrates that the primacy of the deity Tian was already established. ‚ÄúTian‚Äù is a Zhou term for the highest divine force; Shang oracle texts employed the term ‚ÄúDi‚Äù in a similar sense. When the King had completed his address, he bestowed upon He thirty strings of cowries, wherefore has been cast this precious sacrificial vessel for X Gong.Indiana University, Fall 2012ÔºåHistory G380 Early ChinaÔºöreading materialsÔºöhttp://www.indiana.edu/~g380/3.10-WZhou_Bronzes-2010.pdf Lidded ritual wine container (zun) in the form of a bird :PeriodÔºö Middle Eastern Zhou Dynasty :Overall heightÔºö26.5 cm :Wide: 13.5 cm :Deep: 20 cm :Location: Freer Gallery of Art F1961.30a-b This example was reportedly excavated near Taiyuan, Shanxi province, China.

Xi Zun [One] :Period: Late Spring and Autumn :Overall Height: 33.7cm :Length: 58.7cm :Weight: 10.76kg :Location: Shanghai Museum, Shanghai Xi () in ancient Chinese means solid coloured animals used as sacrifice. This vessel is shaped like a vivid ox, which is strong and steady. There are three holes on the ox's back. The middle hole can hold a small wine pot so hot water can be poured into the hollow belly from other two holes. On this basis, researcher infer that Xi Zun might be used to warm wine. Xi Zun is extremely unusual because of its distinctive style and design. This example is the most famous one but not the only one. Xi Zun [Two] A zun in the shape of an ox, dating from the Western Zhou dynasty :Period: Middle Western Zhou Dynasty :Overall Height: 24 cm :Length: 38 cm :Depth of Belly: 10.7 cm :Location: Shaanxi History Museum, Xi'an This example was excavated in 1967 from Hejiacun, Qishan County, Shaanxi. It is a wine container shaped like an ox as well, but with a square hole on its back and a tiger-shaped lid. The tail of the ox is the handle. The exaggerated mould is very magnificent. Gold and silver inlay cloud-patterned rhinoceros Zun Western Han dynasty :Period: Western Han (206 BC ‚Äì AD8) :Overall Height: 34.4 cm :Length: 58.1 cm :Location: National Museum of China, Beijing It was excavated in 1963 from Doumacun, Xingping, Shaanxi Province. This vessel is in the form of a powerful standing rhinoceros with a raised head with pricked ears and sharp tusks. Its eyes are bright black glass beads, giving it a graceful expression. The lid on its back is hinged at the front allowing it to be opened. Cloud decorations cover the entire body with spirals in between, all inlaid with gold and silver, suggesting the fine hairs of the rhinoceros. This is a realistic piece with flowing and lively decoration, and deserves to be considered a masterpiece of Western Han gold and silver inlay.

The lumper‚Äìsplitter problem occurs when there is the desire to create classifications and assign examples to them, for example schools of literature, biological taxa and so on. A \\"lumper\\" is an individual who takes a gestalt view of a definition, and assigns examples broadly, assuming that differences are not as important as signature similarities. A \\"splitter\\" is an individual who takes precise definitions, and creates new categories to classify samples that differ in key ways. Origin of the terms The earliest known use of these terms was by Charles Darwin, in a letter to Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1857: It is good to have hair-splitters & lumpers. They were introduced more widely by George G. Simpson in his 1945 work The Principles of Classification and a Classification of Mammals. As he put it: A later use can be found in the title of a 1969 paper \\"On lumpers and splitters ...\\" by the medical geneticist Victor McKusick. Reference to lumpers and splitters in the humanities appeared in a debate in 1975 between J. H. Hexter and Christopher Hill, in the Times Literary Supplement. It followed from Hexter's detailed review of Hill's book Change and Continuity in Seventeenth Century England, in which Hill developed Max Weber's argument that the rise of capitalism was facilitated by Calvinist Puritanism. Hexter objected to Hill's \\"mining\\" of sources to find evidence that supported his theories. Hexter argued that Hill plucked quotations from sources in a way that distorted their meaning. Hexter explained this as a mental habit that he called \\"lumping\\". According to him, \\"lumpers\\" rejected differences and chose to emphasize similarities. Any evidence that did not fit their arguments was ignored as aberrant. Splitters, by contrast, emphasised differences, and resisted simple schemes. While lumpers consistently tried to create coherent patterns, splitters preferred incoherent complexity. Usage in various fields Biology The categorization and naming of a particular species should be regarded as a hypothesis about the evolutionary relationships and distinguishability of that group of organisms. As further information comes to hand, the hypothesis may be confirmed or refuted. Sometimes, especially in the past when communication was more difficult, taxonomists working in isolation have given two distinct names to individual organisms later identified as the same species. When two named species are agreed to be of the same species, the older species name is almost always retained dropping the newer species name honoring a convention known as \\"priority of nomenclature\\". This form of lumping is technically called synonymization. Dividing a taxon into multiple, often new, taxa is called splitting. Taxonomists are often referred to as \\"lumpers\\" or \\"splitters\\" by their colleagues, depending on their personal approach to recognizing differences or commonalities between organisms.  History  In history, lumpers are those who tend to create broad definitions that cover large periods of time and many disciplines, whereas splitters want to assign names to tight groups of inter-relationships. Lumping tends to create a more and more unwieldy definition, with members having less and less mutually in common. This can lead to definitions which are little more than conventionalities, or groups which join fundamentally different examples. Splitting often leads to \\"distinctions without difference\\", ornate and fussy categories, and failure to see underlying similarities. For example, in the arts, \\"Romantic\\" can refer specifically to a period of German poetry roughly from 1780‚Äì1810, but would exclude the later work of Goethe, among other writers. In music it can mean every composer from Hummel through Rachmaninoff, plus many that came after.  Software modelling  Software engineering often proceeds by building models (sometimes known as model-driven architecture). A lumper is keen to generalize, and produces models with a small number of broadly defined objects. A splitter is reluctant to generalize, and produces models with a large number of narrowly defined objects. Conversion between the two styles is not necessarily symmetrical. For example, if error messages in two narrowly defined classes behave in the same way, the classes can be easily combined. But if some messages in a broad class behave differently, every object in the class must be examined before the class can be split. This illustrates the principle that \\"splits can be lumped more easily than lumps can be split\\".  Language classification  There is no agreement among historical linguists about what amount of evidence is needed for two languages to be safely classified in the same language family. For this reason, many language families have had lumper‚Äìsplitter controversies, including Altaic, Pama‚ÄìNyungan, Nilo-Saharan, and most of the larger families of the Americas. At a completely different level, the splitting of a mutually intelligible dialect continuum into different languages, or lumping them into one, is also an issue that continually comes up, though the consensus in contemporary linguistics is that there is no completely objective way to settle the question. Splitters regard the comparative method (meaning not comparison in general, but only reconstruction of a common ancestor or protolanguage) as the only valid proof of kinship, and consider genetic relatedness to be the question of interest. American linguists of recent decades tend to be splitters. Lumpers are more willing to admit techniques like mass lexical comparison or lexicostatistics, and mass typological comparison, and to tolerate the uncertainty of whether relationships found by these methods are the result of linguistic divergence (descent from common ancestor) or language convergence (borrowing). Much long- range comparison work has been from Russian linguists like Vladislav Illich- Svitych and Sergei Starostin. In the US, Greenberg's and Ruhlen's work has been met with little acceptance from linguists. Earlier American linguists like Morris Swadesh and Edward Sapir also pursued large-scale classifications like Sapir's 1929 scheme for the Americas, accompanied by controversy similar to that today. Merritt Ruhlen: Is Algonquian Amerind?  Liturgical studies  Paul F. Bradshaw suggests that the same principles of lumping and splitting apply to the study of early Christian liturgy. Lumpers, who tend to predominate, try to find a single line of texts from the apostolic age to the fourth century (and later). Splitters see many parallel and overlapping strands which intermingle and flow apart so that there is not a single coherent path in development of liturgical texts. Liturgical texts must not be taken solely at face value; often there are hidden agendas in texts.Bradshaw, Paul F., The Search for the Origins of Christian Worship, Oxford University Press, 2002, p. ix. The Hindu religion is essentially a lumper's concept, sometimes also known as Smartism. Hindu splitters, and individual adherents, often identify themselves as adherents of a religion such as Shaivism, Vaishnavism, or Shaktism according to which deity they believe to be the supreme creator of the universe. Philosophy Freeman Dyson in 2005 Physicist and philosophy writer Freeman Dyson has suggested that one can broadly, if over-simplistically, divide \\"observers of the philosophical scene\\" into splitters and lumpers - roughly corresponding to materialists (who imagine the world as divided into atoms) and Platonists (who regard the world as made up of ideas).Freeman Dyson, Dreams of Earth and Sky, New York Review Books, 2015, p. 238.  Psychiatry  In psychiatry, the > 'splitters' and the 'lumpers' have fundamentally different approaches to > psychiatric diagnosis and classification. First, 'splitters' emphasise the > heterogeneity within the diagnostic categories and argue that this > heterogeneity drives the 'splitting' process'. 'Lumpers', on the other hand, > point to the similarities between the diagnostic categories, and suggest > that these similarities justify the creation of broader entities. Thus lumpers might see \\"stress\\" where splitters could identify (say) worry, grief, or some sort of anxiety disorder.

Originally, the brigade's exclusive mission was to drop into occupied Poland in order to help liberate the country. The British government, however, pressured the Poles into allowing the unit to be used in the Western theatre of war. Operation Market Garden eventually saw the unit sent into action in support of the British 1st Airborne Division at the Battle of Arnhem in September 1944. The Poles were initially landed by glider from 18 September, whilst, due to bad weather over England, the parachute section of the Brigade was held up, and jumped on 21 September at Driel on the South bank of the Rhine. The Poles suffered significant casualties during the next few days of fighting, but still were able, by their presence, to cause around 2,500 German troops to be diverted to deal with them for fear of their supporting the remnants of the 1st Airborne trapped over the lower Rhine in Oosterbeek. History The Brigade was originally trained close to RAF Ringway and later in Upper Largo in Scotland. It was finally based in Lincolnshire, close to RAF Spitalgate (Grantham) where it continued training until its eventual departure for Europe after D-Day. The Brigade was formed by the Polish High Command in exile with the aim of its being used to support the Polish resistance during the nationwide uprising, a plan that encountered opposition from the British, who argued that a single brigade would be of no use against the entire German army stationed in Occupied Poland. The pressure of the British government eventually caused the Poles to give in and agree to let the Brigade be used on the Western Front. On 6 June 1944 the unit, originally the only Polish unit directly subordinate to the Polish government in exile and thus independent of the British command, was transferred into the same command structure as all other Polish Forces in the West. It was slotted to take part in several operations after the invasion of Normandy, but all of them were cancelled. On 27 July, aware of the imminent Warsaw Uprising, the Polish government in exile asked the British government for air support, including dropping the Brigade in the vicinity of Warsaw. This request was refused on the grounds of the aircraft used by the Brigade did not have enough fuel to reach Warsaw, along with the request to use Soviet airfields being denied. Eventually, the Brigade entered combat when it was dropped during Operation Market Garden in September 1944. Stanis≈Çaw Sosabowski, the brigade's commander During the operation, the Brigade's anti-tank battery went into Arnhem on the third day of the battle (19 September), supporting the British paratroopers at Oosterbeek. This left Sosabowski without any anti-tank capability. The light artillery battery was left behind in England due to a shortage of gliders. Owing to bad weather and a shortage of transport planes, the drop into Driel was delayed by two days, to 21 September. The British units which were supposed to cover the landing zone were in a bad situation and out of radio contact with the main Allied forces. Finally, the 2nd Battalion, and elements of the 3rd Battalion, with support troops from the Brigade's Medical Company, Engineer Company and HQ Company, were dropped under German fire east of Driel. They overran Driel, after it was realised that the Heveadorp ferry had been destroyed. In Driel, the Polish paratroopers set up a defensive \\"hedgehog\\" position, from which over the next two nights further attempts were made to cross the Rhine. The following day, the Poles were able to produce some makeshift boats and attempt a crossing. With great difficulty and under German fire from the heights of Westerbouwing on the north bank of the river, the 8th Parachute Company and, later, additional troops from 3rd Battalion, managed to cross the Rhine in two attempts. In total, about 200 Polish paratroopers made it across in two days, and were able to cover the subsequent withdrawal of the remnants of the British 1st Airborne Division. On 26 September 1944, the Brigade (now including the 1st Battalion and elements of the 3rd Battalion, who were parachuted near to Grave on 23 September) was ordered to march towards Nijmegen. The Brigade had lost 25% of its fighting strength, amounting to 590 casualties. In 1945, the Brigade was attached to the Polish 1st Armoured Division and undertook occupation duties in Northern Germany until it was disbanded on 30 June 1947. The majority of its soldiers chose to stay in exile rather than hazard returning to the new Communist Poland.  Post-war honours  Military William Order awarded to the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade Shortly after the war, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands wanted to award the Parachute Brigade and wrote the government a request. However, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Eelco van Kleffens, opposed the idea. He thought an award for the Poles would upset the relations with the 'Big Three' and harm national interests. More than 61 years after World War II, the Brigade was awarded the Military Order of William (31 May 2006) for its distinguished and outstanding acts of bravery, skill and devotion to duty during Operation Market Garden. The Military Order of William is the highest Dutch military award. Only eleven units have been awarded this honor, of which only two are non-Dutch. The award is now worn by the 6th Airborne Brigade which inherited the battle honours of the brigade.  Brigade Order of Battle  *Brigade HQ CO: Maj. Gen S. Sosabowski Deputy Brigade CO: Lt.Col. S.

Described as a \\"flying saucer enthusiast\\", twenty-year-old Valentich informed Melbourne air traffic control he was being accompanied by an aircraft about above him and that his engine had begun running roughly, before finally reporting, \\"It's not an aircraft.\\" There were belated reports of a UFO sighting in Australia on the night of the disappearance; however, the Associated Press reported that the Department of Transport was sceptical a UFO was behind Valentich's disappearance, and that some of their officials speculated that \\"Valentich became disorientated and saw his own lights reflected in the water, or lights from a nearby island, while flying upside down.\\" Frederick Valentich Frederick Valentich Frederick Valentich (born 1958) had about 150 total hours' flying time and held a class-four instrument rating, which authorised him to fly at night, but only \\"in visual meteorological conditions.\\" He had twice applied to enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) but was rejected because of inadequate educational qualifications. He was a member of the RAAF Air Training Corps, determined to have a career in aviation. Valentich was studying part-time to become a commercial pilot but had a poor achievement record, having twice failed all five commercial licence examination subjects, and as recently as the previous month had failed three more commercial licence subjects. He had been involved in flying incidents, for example, straying into a controlled zone in Sydney, for which he received a warning, and twice deliberately flying into a cloud, for which prosecution was being considered. According to his father, Guido, Valentich was an ardent believer in UFOs and had been worried about being attacked by them. Details A Cessna 182 similar to the aircraft involved Valentich radioed Melbourne air traffic control at 7:06 pm to report that an unidentified aircraft was following him at . He was told there was no known traffic at that level. Valentich said he could see a large unknown aircraft which appeared to be illuminated by four bright landing lights. He was unable to confirm its type, but said it had passed about overhead and was moving at high speed. Valentich then reported that the aircraft was approaching him from the east and said the other pilot might be purposely toying with him. Valentich said the aircraft was \\"orbiting\\" above him and that it had a shiny metal surface and a green light on it. Valentich reported that he was experiencing engine problems. Asked to identify the aircraft, Valentich radioed, \\"It's not an aircraft.\\" His transmission was then interrupted by unidentified noise described as being \\"metallic, scraping sounds\\" before all contact was lost. Search and rescue A sea and air search was undertaken that included oceangoing ship traffic, an RAAF Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft, plus eight civilian aircraft. The search encompassed over 1,000 square miles. Search efforts ceased on 25 October 1978 without result. Investigation A Department of Transport (DOT) investigation into Valentich's disappearance was unable to determine the cause but that it was \\"presumed fatal\\" for Valentich. Five years after Valentich's aircraft went missing, an engine cowl flap was found washed ashore on Flinders Island. In July 1983, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation asked the Royal Australian Navy Research Laboratory (RANRL) about the likelihood that the cowl flap might have \\"travelled\\" to its ultimate position from the region where the aircraft disappeared. The bureau noted that \\"the part has been identified as having come from a Cessna 182 aircraft between a certain range of serial numbers\\" which included Valentich's aircraft. Proposed explanations It has been proposed that Valentich staged his own disappearance: even taking into account a trip of between 30 and 45 minutes to Cape Otway, the single-engine Cessna 182 still had enough fuel to fly 800 kilometres;Melbourne Age, 28 October 1978, p. 1 despite ideal conditions, at no time was the aircraft plotted on radar, casting doubts as to whether it was ever near Cape Otway;The Australian, 24 October 1978, pp. 1‚Äì2 and Melbourne Police received reports of a light aircraft making a mysterious landing not far from Cape Otway at the same time as Valentich's disappearance. Another proposed explanation is that Valentich became disoriented and was flying upside down. If this were the case, the lights he thought he saw would be his own aircraft's lights, reflected in the water; he would then have crashed into the water.Discussed on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation television programme Can We Help? in 2007 However, the model Cessna he was piloting could not have flown inverted for long as it has a gravity feed fuel system, meaning that its engine would have cut out very quickly. Yet another proposed possibility is suicide; however, interviews with doctors and colleagues who knew him virtually eliminated this possibility. A 2013 review of the radio transcripts and other data by astronomer and retired U.S. Air Force pilot James McGaha and author Joe Nickell proposes that the inexperienced Valentich was deceived by the illusion of a tilted horizon for which he attempted to compensate and inadvertently put his aircraft into a downward, so-called \\"graveyard spiral\\" which he initially mistook for simple orbiting of the aircraft. According to the authors, the G-forces of a tightening spiral would decrease fuel flow, resulting in the \\"rough idling\\" reported by Valentich. McGaha and Nickell also propose that the apparently stationary, overhead lights that Valentich reported were probably the planets Venus, Mars and Mercury, along with the bright star Antares, which would have behaved in a way consistent with Valentich's description. Ufologists Ufologists have speculated that extraterrestrials either destroyed Valentich's aircraft or abducted him, asserting that some individuals reported seeing \\"an erratically moving green light in the sky\\" and that he was \\"in a steep dive at the time\\". Ufologists believe these accounts are significant because of the \\"green light\\" mentioned in Valentich's radio transmissions. The group Ground Saucer Watch, based in Phoenix, Arizona, United States, claims that photos taken that day by plumber Roy Manifold show a fast-moving object exiting the water near Cape Otway Lighthouse.News Story (23 July 1980), The Standard (Melbourne) According to UFO writer Jerome Clark, Ground Saucer Watch argued that they showed \\"a bona fide unknown flying object, of moderate dimensions, apparently surrounded by a cloud-like vapour/exhaust residue\\", although the pictures were not clear enough to identify the object.

It lies 7 miles (11.3 km) northeast of Charing Cross. The area it takes its name from a bridge built over the River Lea in 1745, and the Lea Bridge Road which leads through the area and across the bridge. The bridge also gives its name to a ward in Waltham Forest (Lea Bridge) on the eastern, Leyton, bank of the river, and to a ward in Hackney on the Western side of the river, also called Lea Bridge ward. The boundary between the two boroughs runs down the middle of the river at this point. Within Hackney, Lea Bridge Road forms the customary boundary between Upper and Lower Clapton. History In 1582 Mill Fields Lane ran from Clapton to Jeremy's Ferry in the Leyton Marshes. At the same spot a timber bridge was built in 1745, and the road became known as Lea Bridge Road, with a tollgate at the Clapton end.'Hackney: Communications', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 10: Hackney (1995), pp. 4-10 Date accessed: 1 November 2006 A toll house was built on the west bank of the river in 1757, and the bridge rebuilt in iron in 1820-1\\\\. Tolls continued to be levied until 1872. Clapton Orient played at the Lea Bridge Stadium between 1930 and 1937 before moving to Brisbane Road. The stadium was also used for speedway and was the home track of the Lea Bridge speedway team. It was demolished in the 1970s and a housing estate built on the site. Local area There are few crossing points for the Lea Marshes. The nearest major river crossing to the south is at Hackney Wick and to the north at Tottenham Hale. The area contains large amounts of open space, dominated by Millfields recreation grounds, one of the largest parks in Hackney and recently awarded a Green Flag, to mark the high standard of the park environment and its maintenance. Along the southern border of the park is the site of what was once a coal-fired Millfields power station, now used as a sub-station, on the London Ring, and recently upgraded. This was built in 1901, well before the creation of the National Grid in 1938, a period when power had to be generated near to the consumer. It provided electric street lighting throughout the then Metropolitan Borough of Hackney. The Princess of Wales pub from Lea Bridge (October 2005) Lea Bridge gives ready access to the lower reaches of the extensive Lee Valley Park, which stretches for about on both banks of the river. Next to the south side of the bridge is a [public houses , the \\"Princess of Wales\\" and a Grade *II listed Victorian Old School Room, built in 1862, for the education of the children of those who lived by a now built over dock - the former schoolhouse is now restored and occupied by a Buddhist Order. To the south are the Hackney Marshes, and beyond Leyton Marsh to the north are the Walthamstow Marshes and Nature Reserve. Also to the South is the former Olympic Park, now called the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Below the bridge, the river flows over the Middlesex Filter Beds Weir, marking the boundary with Leyton and providing the supply for the former East London Waterworks Company. The old Middlesex Filter Beds have been converted into a nature reserve, and on the Leyton side the corresponding Essex Filter Beds are now a reserve for birds. The Lee Navigation continues south in an artificial channel known as 'Hackney Cut', to the next lock at Old Ford (about 1.7 miles), where the natural channel rejoins the Navigation after its meander towards Leyton. To the North of the river is an ice rink, which is the subject of a planning application (in October 2020) to demolish and replace with a double pad ice rink and other leisure facilities. There is also an Oxbow Island, created by the meandering of the river, along the north bank, which is one of the remaining areas of wild land and wildlife in the area and is the responsibility of the Canal and Rivers Trust.  Geography  Education Transport Lea Bridge Railway Station when it reopened in 2016. The local station for Lea Bridge is Lea Bridge railway station on the Lea Valley lines. Also close by is Clapton Station on the Liverpool Street to Chingford line. Lea Bridge Road is well served by buses having seven bus routes in total, two of which are night routes, and one 24-hour route. Buses in the area include routes 55, 56, 58 and W19, with the addition of night routes N38, N55 and 24-hour operated route 158. More recently, there is now a 308 bus which comes from Leabridge roundabout and turns into Chatsworth Road, going to Stratford. From Leabridge roundbaout intersection with Upper and Lower Clapton roads, a number of buses travel south through Hackney, and to the City, and to the north through Stamford Hill and Stoke Newington.

He was the brother of Thomas Saltus Lubbock, for whom Lubbock County, Texas, and the City of Lubbock are named. Early life Lubbock was born in Beaufort, South Carolina. Lubbock was a businessman in South Carolina before moving to Texas in 1836. During the Republic of Texas period, President Sam Houston appointed Lubbock to be comptroller. Career In 1857, Lubbock was elected lieutenant governor of Texas as a Democrat, but failed in his re-election bid in 1859. Following the Confederate secession in 1861, Lubbock won the governorship of Texas. During his tenure, he supported Confederate conscription, working to draft all able-bodied men, including resident aliens, into the Confederate States Army. He was known to praise the Great Hanging at Gainesville, where in October 1862, some 42 suspected Unionists were murdered, convicted and killed by hanging through sentences by a \\"Citizens Court\\" organized by Texas state troops, but not recognized under state law, with some 14 lynched without benefit even of a show trial. It was part of an outbreak of violence, often caused by Confederate or state troops, in North Texas in the early years of the war. When Lubbock's term ended in 1863, he joined the Confederate Army. He was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel, serving under Major General John B. Magruder. By 1864, Lubbock was promoted to aide-de-camp for Jefferson Davis. Following the Confederacy's military collapse, Lubbock fled from Richmond, Virginia, with Davis. They were soon caught by Union troops in Georgia. He was imprisoned at Fort Delaware with John Reagan and Jefferson Davis for eight months before being paroled. On his return to Texas, Lubbock continued to pursue business interests in Houston and Galveston. From 1878 to 1891, he served as Texas State Treasurer. Death and legacy Lubbock died in Austin.

Her hold on McEwen was always somewhat tenuous due to its demographics. Although classed as rural by the Australian Electoral Commission, it is actually a hybrid urban-rural seat. It includes several outer northern suburbs of Melbourne that tilt heavily to Labor, while the more rural portion votes equally heavily for the Liberals and Nationals. However, the 2007 election resulted in McEwen becoming the most marginal seat in the country. Initially, it appeared that Bailey had lost to former Labor state MP Rob Mitchell by six votes. Bailey requested and was granted a full recount, which gave her the win by 12 votes. The result was challenged in the High Court of Australia in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns, and was referred to the Federal Court of Australia. Over seven months after the election and a review of 643 individual votes, the court altered the formal status of several dozen, eventually declaring Bailey the winner by 27 votes. Following the resolution of the long- running dispute, Bailey called for a total overhaul of the voting system. Bailey announced in October 2009 that she would retire at the 2010 election.

The Ealing comedies is an informal name for a series of comedy films produced by the London-based Ealing Studios during the period 1947 to 1957. Hue and Cry (1947) is generally considered to be the earliest of the cycle, and Barnacle Bill (1957) the last,Parkinson, David. Radio Times Guide to Films 2010, BBC Worldwide, 2009. although some sources list Davy (1958) as the final Ealing comedy.http://www.britmovie.co.uk/studios/Ealing-Studios Ealing Studios Filmography History Relatively few comedy films were made at Ealing Studios until several years after World War II.Murphy p.209 The 1939 film Cheer Boys Cheer, featuring the rivalry between two brewing companies, one big and modernist, the other small and traditional, has been characterised as a prototype of later films. One of the few other films that can be seen as a direct precursor to the Ealing comedies is Saloon Bar (1940), in which the regulars of a public house join forces to clear the name of the barmaid's boyfriend who has been accused of murder.Murphy p.209-210 Other wartime comedies featuring actors such as Tommy Trinder, Will Hay and George Formby were generally in a broader music hall tradition and had little in common with the later Ealing comedy films. Ealing made no comedy films at all in 1945 and 1946.Murphy p.211 Comedies T.E.B. Clarke wrote the screenplay for Hue and Cry (1947), about a group of schoolboys who confront a criminal gang, which proved to be a critical and commercial success. It was followed by three films with Celtic themes: Another Shore (1948), about the fantasies of a bored Dublin customs official, A Run for Your Money (1949), depicting the adventures of two inexperienced Welshman in London for an important rugby international, and Whisky Galore!, (1949) about Scottish islanders during the Second World War who discover that a freighter with a large cargo of whisky has run aground. Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949) is a dark comedy in which the son of an impoverished branch of the aristocratic D'Ascoyne family murders eight other members, all of whom are played by Alec Guinness, in order to inherit the family dukedom and gain revenge on his snobbish relations. In Passport to Pimlico (1949) the inhabitants of the London neighborhood of Pimlico attempt to create their own independent nation state and end rationing, leading to a variety of unexpected problems and diplomatic incidents with the British government. The Magnet (1950), set in Liverpool, is about a boy whose acquisition of a magnet leads to a series of adventures in the city. In The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) a timid bank clerk gets together an unlikely gang of accomplices to snatch a delivery of gold bullion. The armed robbery proves surprisingly successful, but things start to go wrong when they attempt to melt down their haul into model Eiffel Towers. The Man in the White Suit (1951) features the efforts of a zealous young scientist to create a new kind of clothing material that will never get dirty and never wear out ‚Äì an invention that threatens the livelihoods of both big business and the trade unions who join forces to try to prevent the publication of this new discovery. The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953) echoes the theme of Passport to Pimlico, switched to a rural setting, with a small community standing up for their local interests when their branch line is threatened with closure by British Railways in a forerunner of the Beeching cuts a decade later. The villagers join forces to keep their railway running, but face competition and sabotage from a rival bus company. Meet Mr. Lucifer (1953) follows a television set as it is passed on from one owner to another, causing dissatisfaction wherever it goes. The film serves as a warning about the effects of rapidly expanding television use. The Love Lottery (1954) sees a matinee idol Hollywood star, played by David Niven, agree to take part in a \\"love lottery\\". The Maggie (1954) features a clash of culture and wills between a wily Scottish boat captain and a vigorous American business tycoon who has mistakenly contracted the boat to carry a cargo for him. In The Ladykillers (1955) a gang of criminals rent a room from the elderly Mrs Wilberforce while they're pretending to be a string quintet looking for a space to practice. They plan to use the house to stage a robbery at nearby King's Cross railway station. On the brink of escape, they are thwarted by Mrs Wilberforce who discovers their true purpose. The gang agree that she has to be murdered before she can go to the police, but prove incapable of doing this, and begin turning on each other instead. Later comedies Who Done It? (1956) was the final comedy made at Ealing Studios, before it was sold to the BBC. It parodies detective fiction with a young man setting himself up in business as a private detective after receiving a windfall of ¬£100. His confused efforts to solve a crime lead to him becoming entangled in cold war espionage. The film was closer in style to traditional 1930s comedy, rather than the type of films Ealing had become known for over the previous decade.Burton & O'Sullivan p.21-22 Two final comedies were released under the Ealing banner, but made at Elstree Studios. Barnacle Bill (1957) follows Captain Ambrose who, after leaving the navy, buys a run-down pier on the English seaside. Ambrose tries to revive the pier crossing swords with the local council who have a scheme to redevelop the entire seafront, personally enriching themselves while ruining him. Ambrose battles them by severing his connection with the shore, registering his pier as a ship under a foreign flag, and marketing it as a tourist destination for those too seasick to go on cruises. In Davy (1958) a promising entertainer tries to decide whether to strike out on his own, or stay with his family's struggling music hall act. No further comedies were made by Ealing, and after the thriller Siege of Pinchgut (1959), the brand was absorbed into the wider Rank Organisation. The previous year Rank had released Rockets Galore!, a sequel to Whisky Galore!, but its production was unconnected with Ealing. Personnel Many of the films were built around a repertory group of actors, screenwriters, directors and technicians. Directors were Alexander Mackendrick, Charles Crichton, Robert Hamer, Charles Frend, Anthony Pelissier and Henry Cornelius. Notable actors who became prolific in these films included Stanley Holloway, Alec Guinness, Raymond Huntley and Alastair Sim. A number of actors also appeared frequently in smaller roles such as Philip Stainton and Edie Martin. Legacy Though Ealing Studios has come to be remembered for its comedies, they were only a tenth of its productions.Sweet p.157 Conversely, Gainsborough Pictures is associated with the Gainsborough melodramas though it also produced many comedies. Two Ealing comedies were adapted for radio and broadcast over BBC Radio 4: Kind Hearts and Coronets in 1990 starring Robert Powell and Timothy Bateson and in 2007 starring Michael Kitchen and Harry Enfield, and The Ladykillers in 1996 starring Edward Petherbridge.

British sailors boarding an Algerine pirate ship A man from the Barbary states A Barbary pirate, Pier Francesco Mola 1650 The Barbary pirates, sometimes called Barbary corsairs or Ottoman corsairs, were Muslim pirates and privateers who operated from North Africa, based primarily in the ports of Sal√©, Rabat, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli. This area was known in Europe as the Barbary Coast, in reference to the Berbers. Their predation extended throughout the Mediterranean, south along West Africa's Atlantic seaboard and into the North Atlantic as far north as Iceland, but they primarily operated in the western Mediterranean. In addition to seizing merchant ships, they engaged in Razzias, raids on European coastal towns and villages, mainly in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal, but also in the British Isles, the Netherlands, and Iceland. The main purpose of their attacks was slaves for the Ottoman slave trade as well as the general Arab slavery market in North Africa and the Middle East. Slaves in Barbary could be of many ethnicities, and of many different religions, such as Christian, Jewish, or Muslim. While such raids had occurred since soon after the Muslim conquest of Iberian Peninsula in the 710s, the terms \\"Barbary pirates\\" and \\"Barbary corsairs\\" are normally applied to the raiders active from the 16th century onwards, when the frequency and range of the slavers' attacks increased. In that period Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli came under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, either as directly administered provinces or as autonomous dependencies known as the Barbary States. Similar raids were undertaken from Sal√© and other ports in Morocco. Barbary corsairs captured thousands of merchant ships and repeatedly raided coastal towns. As a result, residents abandoned their former villages of long stretches of coast in Spain and Italy. Between 100,000 and 250,000 Iberians were enslaved by these raids. The raids were such a problem coastal settlements were seldom undertaken until the 19th century. Between 1580 and 1680 corsairs were said to have captured about 850,000 people as slaves and from 1530 to 1780 as many as 1,250,000 people were enslaved. However, these numbers have been questioned by the historian David Earle. Some of these corsairs were European outcasts and converts (renegade) such as John Ward and Zymen Danseker.Review of Pirates of Barbary by Ian W. Toll, New York Times, 12 Dec. 2010 Hayreddin Barbarossa and Oru√ß Reis, Turkish Barbarossa Brothers, who took control of Algiers on behalf of the Ottomans in the early 16th century, were also notorious corsairs. The European pirates brought advanced sailing and shipbuilding techniques to the Barbary Coast around 1600, which enabled the corsairs to extend their activities into the Atlantic Ocean. The effects of the Barbary raids peaked in the early to mid-17th century. Long after Europeans had abandoned oar-driven vessels in favor of sailing ships carrying tons of powerful cannon, many Barbary warships were galleys carrying a hundred or more fighting men armed with cutlasses and small arms. The Barbary navies were not battle fleets. When they sighted a European frigate, they fled. The scope of corsair activity began to diminish in the latter part of the 17th century, as the more powerful European navies started to compel the Barbary States to make peace and cease attacking their shipping. However, the ships and coasts of Christian states without such effective protection continued to suffer until the early 19th century. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna in 1814‚Äì15, European powers agreed upon the need to suppress the Barbary corsairs entirely and the threat was largely subdued. Occasional incidents occurred, including two Barbary wars between the United States and the Barbary States, until finally terminated by the French conquest of Algeria in 1830. History In 1198 the problem of Barbary piracy and slave-taking was so great that the Trinitarians, a religious order, were founded to collect ransoms and even to exchange themselves as ransom for those captured and pressed into slavery in North Africa. In the 14th century Tunisian corsairs became enough of a threat to provoke a Franco-Genoese attack on Mahdia in 1390, also known as the \\"Barbary Crusade\\". Morisco exiles of the Reconquista and Maghreb pirates added to the numbers, but it was not until the expansion of the Ottoman Empire and the arrival of the privateer and admiral Kemal Reis in 1487 that the Barbary corsairs became a true menace to shipping from European Christian nations.Pryor (1988), p. 192 British captain witnessing the miseries of Christian slaves in Algiers, 1815 During the American Revolution the pirates attacked American merchant vessels in the Mediterranean. But, on December 20, 1777, Sultan Mohammed III of Morocco issued a declaration recognizing America as an independent country, and stating that American merchant ships could enjoy safe passage into the Mediterranean and along the coast. The relations were formalized with the Moroccan-American Treaty of Friendship signed in 1786, which stands as the U.S.'s oldest non-broken friendship treatyRoberts, Priscilla H. and Richard S. Roberts, Thomas Barclay (1728‚Äì1793: Consul in France, Diplomat in Barbary, Lehigh University Press, 2008, pp. 206‚Äì223. with a foreign power. As late as 1798, an islet near Sardinia was attacked by the Tunisians, and more than 900 inhabitants were taken away as slaves.Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500‚Äì1800. Robert Davis (2004). p.45. . 16th century Battle of Preveza, 1538 From 1659, these African cities, although nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, were in fact military republics that chose their own rulers and lived by war booty captured from the Spanish and Portuguese. There are several cases of Sephardic Jews, including Sinan Reis and Samuel Pallache, who upon fleeing Iberia turned to attacking the Spanish Empire's shipping under the Ottoman flag, a profitable strategy of revenge for the Inquisition's religious persecution. During the first period (1518‚Äì1587), the beylerbeys were admirals of the sultan, commanding great fleets and conducting war operations for political ends. They were slave-hunters and their methods were ferocious. After 1587, the sole object of their successors became plunder, on land and sea. The maritime operations were conducted by the captains, or reises, who formed a class or even a corporation. Cruisers were fitted out by investors and commanded by the reises. Ten percent of the value of the prizes was paid to the pasha or his successors, who bore the titles of agha or dey or bey. The Barbary pirates frequently attacked Corsica, resulting in many Genoese towers being erected. In 1544 Hayreddin captured the island of Ischia, taking 4,000 prisoners, and enslaved some 2,000‚Äì7,000 inhabitants of Lipari. In 1551 Turgut Reis enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island of Gozo, between 5,000 and 6,000, sending them to Ottoman Tripolitania. In 1554 corsairs under Turgut Reis sacked Vieste, beheaded 5,000 of its inhabitants, and abducted another 6,000. 17th century Aert Anthonisz, A notable counter action occurred in 1607, when the Knights of Saint Stephen (under Jacopo Inghirami) sacked Bona in Algeria, killing 470 and taking 1,464 captives. This victory is commemorated by a series of frescoes painted by Bernardino Poccetti in the \\"Sala di Bona\\" of Palazzo Pitti, Florence. In 1611 Spanish galleys from Naples, accompanied by the galleys of the Knights of Malta, raided the Kerkennah Islands off the coast of Tunisia and took away almost 500 Muslim captives. Between 1568 and 1634 the Knights of Saint Stephen may have captured about 14,000 Muslims, with perhaps one-third taken in land raids and two- thirds taken on captured ships. Battle of a French ship of the line and two galleys of the Barbary corsairs The work of the Mercedarians was in ransoming Christian slaves held in Muslim hands, Histoire de Barbarie et de ses Corsaires, 1637 Ireland was subject to a similar attack. In June 1631 Murat Reis, with corsairs from Algiers and armed troops of the Ottoman Empire, stormed ashore at the little harbor village of Baltimore, County Cork. They captured almost all the villagers and took them away to a life of slavery in North Africa. The prisoners were destined for a variety of fates ‚Äì some lived out their days chained to the oars as galley slaves, while women spent long years as concubines in harems or within the walls of the sultan's palace. Only two of these captives ever returned to Ireland. More than 20,000 captives were said to be imprisoned in Algiers alone. The rich were often able to secure release through ransom, but the poor were condemned to slavery. Their masters would on occasion allow them to secure freedom by professing Islam. A long list might be given of people of good social position, not only Italians or Spaniards, but German or English travelers in the south, who were captives for a time. An action between an English ship and vessels of the Barbary Corsairs Lieve Pietersz Verschuier, Dutch ships bomb Tripoli in a punitive expedition against the Barbary pirates, In 1675 a Royal Navy squadron led by Sir John Narborough negotiated a lasting peace with Tunis and, after bombarding the city to induce compliance, with Tripoli.  18th‚Äì19th centuries Captain William Bainbridge paying tribute to the Dey of Algiers, circa 1800 Piracy was enough of a problem that some states entered into the redemption business. In Denmark, \\"At the beginning of the 18th century money was collected systematically in all churches, and a so called 'slave fund' (slavekasse) was established by the state in 1715. Funds were brought in through a compulsory insurance sum for seafarers. 165 slaves were ransomed by this institution between 1716 and 1736.\\"Peter Madsen, \\"Danish slaves in Barbary\\", Islam in European Literature Conference, Denmark \\"Between 1716 and 1754 19 ships from Denmark-Norway were captured with 208 men; piracy was thus a serious problem for the Danish merchant fleet.\\" Until the American Declaration of Independence in 1776, British treaties with the North African states protected American ships from the Barbary corsairs. Morocco, which in 1777 was the first independent nation to publicly recognize the United States, in 1784 became the first Barbary power to seize an American vessel after the nation achieved independence. The Barbary threat led directly to the United States founding the United States Navy in March 1794. While the United States did secure peace treaties with the Barbary states, it was obliged to pay tribute for protection from attack. The burden was substantial: in 1800 payments in ransom and tribute to the Barbary states amounted to 20% of United States federal government's annual expenditures. Bombardment of Algiers by Lord Exmouth in August 1816, Thomas Luny The Barbary states had difficulty securing uniform compliance with a total prohibition of slave-raiding, as this had been traditionally of central importance to the North African economy. Slavers continued to take captives by preying on less well-protected peoples. Algiers subsequently renewed its slave-raiding, though on a smaller scale. Europeans at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818 discussed possible retaliation. In 1824 a British fleet under Admiral Sir Harry Neal bombarded Algiers. Corsair activity based in Algiers did not entirely cease until France conquered the state in 1830. Slaves Barbary slaves According to Robert Davis, between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa and Ottoman Empire between the 16th and 19th centuries.Davis, Robert. Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500‚Äì1800.\\"When Europeans were slaves: Research suggests white slavery was much more common than previously believed\\" , Research News, Ohio State University However, to extrapolate his numbers, Davis assumes the number of European slaves captured by Barbary pirates were constant for a 250-year period, stating: Slave market in Algiers, 1684 Davis' numbers have been questioned by the historian David Earle, who said of Davis' numbers \\"His figures sound a bit dodgy and I think he may be exaggerating\\" and cautioned that the true picture of European slaves is clouded by the fact that the corsairs also seized non-Christian whites from eastern Europe and black people from west Africa. In addition, the number of slaves traded was hyperactive, with exaggerated estimates relying on peak years to calculate averages for entire centuries, or millennia. Hence, there were wide fluctuations year-to-year, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, given slave imports, and given the fact that, prior to the 1840s, there are no consistent records. Middle East expert, John Wright, cautions that modern estimates are based on back-calculations from human observation. Such observations, across the late 1500s and early 1600s observers, account for around 35,000 European Christian slaves held throughout this period on the Barbary Coast, across Tripoli, Tunis, but mostly in Algiers. The majority were sailors (particularly those who were English), taken with their ships, but others were fishermen and poor coastal villagers. However, most of these captives were people from lands close to Africa, particularly Spain and Italy. From bases on the Barbary coast, North Africa, the Barbary pirates raided ships traveling through the Mediterranean and along the northern and western coasts of Africa, plundering their cargo and enslaving the people they captured. From at least 1500, the pirates also conducted raids along seaside towns of Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, England, the Netherlands and as far away as Iceland, capturing men, women and children. On some occasions, settlements such as Baltimore, Ireland were abandoned following the raid, only being resettled many years later. Between 1609 and 1616, England alone had 466 merchant ships lost to Barbary pirates.Rees Davies, \\"British Slaves on the Barbary Coast\\", BBC, 1 July 2003 Christian slaves in Algiers, early 19th century Captives often suffered from privation on voyages to North Africa if taken at a distance. Those who survived the journeys were often forced to walk through town as they were taken to slave auctions. The slaves typically had to stand from eight in the morning until two in the afternoon while buyers viewed them. Next came the auction, where the townspeople would bid on the captives they wanted to purchase and once that was over, the governor of Algiers (the Dey) had the chance to purchase any slave he wanted for the price they were sold at the auction. During the auctions the slaves would be forced to run and jump around to show their strength and stamina. After purchase, the captives would either be held for ransom, or be put to work. Slaves were used for a wide variety of jobs, from hard manual labor to housework (the job assigned to most women slaves). At night the slaves were put into prisons called 'bagnios' (derived from the Italian word \\"bagno\\" for public bath, inspired by the Turks' use of Roman baths at Constantinople as prisons),Definition of \\"bagnio\\" from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Accessed 23 February 2015 which were often hot and overcrowded. However, these bagnios began improving by the 18th century. Some bagnios had chapels, hospitals, shops, and bars run by captives, though such amenities remained uncommon. Galley slaves Conquest of Tunis by Charles V and liberation of Christian galley slaves in 1535 Although the conditions in bagnios were harsh, they were better than those endured by galley slaves. Most Barbary galleys were at sea for around eighty to a hundred days a year, but when the slaves assigned to them were on land, they were forced to do hard manual labor. There were exceptions: \\"galley slaves of the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople would be permanently confined to their galleys, and often served extremely long terms, averaging around nineteen years in the late seventeenth-century and early eighteenth-century periods. These slaves rarely got off the galley but lived there for years.\\" During this time, rowers were shackled and chained where they sat, and never allowed to leave. Sleeping (which was limited), eating, defecation and urination took place at the seat to which they were shackled. There were usually five or six rowers on each oar. Overseers would walk back and forth and whip slaves considered not to be working hard enough. French bombardment of Algiers by Admiral Dupper√©, 13 June 1830 Coat of arms of the town of Almu√±√©car, granted by King Charles V in 1526, showing the turbaned heads of three Barbary pirates floating in the sea. Famous Barbary corsairs According to historian Adrian Tinniswood, the most notorious corsairs were European renegades who had learned their trade as privateers, and who moved to the Barbary Coast during peacetime to pursue their trade. These outcasts, who had converted to Islam, brought up-to-date naval expertise to the piracy business, and enabled the corsairs to make long-distance slave-catching raids as far away as Iceland and Newfoundland. Infamous corsair Henry Mainwaring, who was initially a lawyer and pirate-hunter, later returned home to a royal pardon. Mainwaring later wrote a book about the practise of piracy in the Mediterranean, aptly titled the Discourse of Pirates. In the book, Mainwaring outlined potential methods to hunt down and eliminate piracy. Barbarossa brothers Oru√ß Barbarossa The most famous of the corsairs in North Africa were Albanian/Greek brothers Oru√ß and Hƒ±zƒ±r Hayreddin. They, and two less well- known brothers all became Barbary corsairs in the service of the Ottoman Empire; they were called the Barbarossas (Italian for Redbeards) after the red beard of Oru√ß, the eldest. Oru√ß captured the island of Djerba for the Ottoman Empire in 1502 or 1503. He often attacked Spanish territories on the coast of North Africa; during one failed attempt in 1512 he lost his left arm to a cannonball. The eldest Barbarossa also went on a rampage through Algiers in 1516, and captured the town with the help of the Ottoman Empire. He executed the ruler of Algiers and everybody he suspected would oppose him, including local rulers. He was finally captured and killed by the Spanish in 1518, and put on display. Hƒ±zƒ±r Hayreddin Barbarossa Ottoman admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa Oru√ß, based mainly on land, was not the best-known of the Barbarossas. His youngest brother Hƒ±zƒ±r (later called Hayreddin or Kheir ed- Din) was a more traditional corsair. He was a capable engineer and spoke at least six languages. He dyed the hair of his head and beard with henna to redden it like Oru√ß's. After capturing many crucial coastal areas, Hayreddin was appointed admiral-in-chief of the Ottoman sultan's fleet. Under his command the Ottoman Empire was able to gain and keep control of the Mediterranean for over thirty years. Barbaros Hƒ±zƒ±r Hayreddin Pasha died in 1546 of a fever, possibly the plague. Captain Jack Ward English corsair Jack, or John, Ward was once called \\"beyond doubt the greatest scoundrel that ever sailed from England\\" by the English ambassador to Venice. Ward was a privateer for Queen Elizabeth during her war with Spain; after the end of the war, he became a corsair. With some associates he captured a ship in about 1603 and sailed it to Tunis; he and his crew converted to Islam. He was successful and became rich. He introduced heavily armed square-rigged ships, used instead of galleys, to the North African area, a major reason for the Barbary's future dominance of the Mediterranean. He died of plague in 1622. Sayyida al-Hurra Sayyida al-Hurra was a female Muslim cleric, merchant, governor of T√©touan, and later the wife of the sultan of Morocco. She was born around 1485 in the Emirate of Granada, but was forced to flee to Morocco when she was very young to escape the Reconquista. In Morocco, she gathered a crew largely of exiled Moors, and launched pirate expeditions against Spain and Portugal to avenge the Reconquista, protect Morocco from Christian pirates, and seek riches and glory. She co-founded the Barbary Corsairs with her allies the Barbarossa brothers. Sayyida al-Hurra became wealthy and renowned enough for the Sultan of Morocco, Ahmad al-Wattasi to make her his queen. Notably, however, she refused to marry in his capital of Fez, and would not get married but in T√©touan, of which she was governor. This was the first and only time in history that a Moroccan monarch had married away from his capital. Other famous Barbary corsairs Mulai Ahmed er Raisunis Headquarter in Tangier, Morocco.

In Mozart's opera Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail (a Singspiel), two European ladies are discovered in a Turkish harem, presumably captured by Barbary corsairs. Rossini's opera L'Italiana in Algeri is based on the capture of several slaves by Barbary corsairs led by the bey of Algiers.

UFO, alien abduction and mind control plots can also be part of radical political apocalyptic and millenarian narratives. Reports of the abduction phenomenon have been made all around the world, but are most common in English speaking countries, especially the United States. The first alleged alien abduction claim to be widely publicized was the Betty and Barney Hill abduction in 1961.{{cite newstitle=Testament for Believersurl=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,828455,00.htmlquote=On the night of Sept. 19, 1961, Barney Hill and his wife Betty were driving home to Portsmouth, N.H., after a holiday in Montreal.

However, there is little doubt that many apparently stable persons who report alien abductions believe their experiences were real. John E. Mack, John Wilson, Rima Laibow and David Gotlib assessed that while psychopathology was associated to some cases, most reports were from sane, common people.Lord, Deane W. \\"John Mack on Abductions\\" (Harvard University Gazette, 1992) URL accessed Jan 23, 2006Appelle, S., et al. Alien abduction experiences. In Carde√±a, E., Lynn. S. J., & Krippner, S. (Eds.) (2000). Varieties of Anomalous Experience. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. p. 268.Huyghe, Patrick, \\"The Dark Side\\" URL accessed January 23, 2006 (1993) Some abduction reports are quite detailed. An entire subculture has developed around the subject, with support groups and a detailed mythos explaining the reasons for abductions: The various aliens (Greys, Reptilians, \\"Nordics\\" and so on) are said to have specific roles, origins, and motivations. Abduction claimants do not always attempt to explain the phenomenon, but some take independent research interest in it themselves and explain the lack of greater awareness of alien abduction as the result of either extraterrestrial or governmental interest in cover-up.  History   Paleo-abductions  While the term \\"alien abduction\\" did not achieve widespread attention until the 1960s, modern speculation about some older stories interpreted them as possible cases. UFO researcher Jerome Clark dubbed them \\"paleo-abductions\\". * In the November 27, 1896, edition of the Stockton, California Daily Mail, Colonel H. G. Shaw claimed he and a friend were harassed by three tall, slender humanoids whose bodies were covered with a fine, downy hair who tried to kidnap the pair. * In the October 1953 issue of Man to Man Magazine an article by Leroy Thorpe titled \\"Are the Flying Saucers Kidnapping Humans?\\" asks the question \\"Are an unlucky few of us, and perhaps not so few at that, being captured with the same ease as we would net butterflies, perhaps for zoological specimens, perhaps for vivisection or some other horrible death designed to reveal to our interplanetary invaders what makes us tick?\\" Gross, Loren E. (1990) UFOs: A History, 1953 August‚ÄìDecember pp. 43‚Äì44. * Rogerson writes that the 1955 publication of Harold T. Wilkins's Flying Saucers Uncensored declared that Karl Hunrath and Wilbur Wilkinson, who had claimed they were contacted by aliens, had disappeared under mysterious circumstances; Wilkins reported speculation that the duo were the victims of \\"alleged abduction by flying saucers\\".  Two landmark cases  An early alien abduction claim occurred in the mid-1950s with the Brazilian Antonio Vilas Boas case, which did not receive much attention until several years later. Widespread publicity was generated by the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case of 1961, culminating in a made-for-television film broadcast in 1975 (starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons) dramatizing the events. The Hill incident was probably the prototypical abduction case and was perhaps the first in which the claimant described beings that later became widely known as the Greys and in which the beings were said to explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin. Though these two cases are sometimes viewed as the earliest abductions, skeptic Peter Rogerson notes they were only the first abduction cases, establishing a template that later abductees and researchers would refine but rarely deviate from. Additionally, Rogerson notes purported abductions were cited contemporaneously at least as early as 1954, and that \\"the growth of the abduction stories is a far more tangled affair than the 'entirely unpredisposed' official history would have us believe.\\" (The phrase \\"entirely predisposed\\" appeared in folklorist Thomas E. Allard's study of alien abduction; he argued that alien abductions as reported in the 1970s and 1980s had little precedent in folklore or fiction.)  Later developments  R. Leo Sprinkle, a University of Wyoming psychologist, became interested in the abduction phenomenon in the 1960s. Sprinkle became convinced of the phenomenon's actuality, and was perhaps the first to suggest a link between abductions and cattle mutilation. Eventually Sprinkle came to believe that he had been abducted by aliens in his youth; he was forced from his job in 1989.Bryan, 145fn Budd Hopkins had been interested in UFOs for some years. In the 1970s he became interested in abduction reports, and began using hypnosis to extract more details of dimly remembered events. Hopkins soon became a figurehead of the growing abductee subculture.Schnabel 1994 (missing source) The 1980s brought a major degree of mainstream attention to the subject. Works by Hopkins, novelist Whitley Strieber, historian David M. Jacobs and psychiatrist John E. Mack presented alien abduction as a plausible experience. Also of note in the 1980s was the publication of folklorist Thomas E. Bullard's comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees. With Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack, accounts of alien abduction became a prominent aspect of ufology. There had been earlier abduction reports (the Hills being the best known), but they were believed to be few and far between, and saw rather little attention from ufology (and even less attention from mainstream professionals or academics). Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was far more common than earlier suspected; they estimate that tens of thousands (or more) North Americans had been taken by unexplained beings. Furthermore, Jacobs and Hopkins argued that there was an elaborate process underway in which aliens were attempting to create human‚Äìalien hybrids, the most advanced stage of which in the \\"human hybridization program\\" are known as hubrids,Jacobs (2015), p. 31. entire chapter 2 \\"Abductees, Aliens, and the Program\\" (pp. 15‚Äì46, especially Table 2, is helpful). though the motives for this effort were unknown. There had been anecdotal reports of phantom pregnancy related to UFO encounters at least as early as the 1960s, but Budd Hopkins and especially David M. Jacobs were instrumental in popularizing the idea of widespread, systematic interbreeding efforts on the part of the alien intruders. The descriptions of alien encounters as researched and presented by Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack were similar, with slight differences in each researcher's emphasis; the process of selective citation of abductee interviews that supported these variations was sometimes criticized ‚Äì though abductees who presented their own accounts directly, such as Whitley Strieber, fared no better. The involvement of Jacobs and Mack marked something of a sea change in the abduction studies. Their efforts were controversial (both men saw some degree of damage to their professional reputations), but to other observers, Jacobs and Mack brought a degree of respectability to the subject.  John E. Mack  Matheson writes that \\"if Jacobs's credentials were impressive,\\" then those of Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack might seem \\"impeccable\\" in comparison.Matheson, 251 Mack was a well known, highly esteemed psychiatrist, author of over 150 scientific articles and winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of T. E. Lawrence. Mack became interested in the phenomenon in the late 1980s, interviewing over 800 people, and eventually writing two books on the subject. Mack devoted a substantial amount of time to investigating such cases and eventually concluded that the only phenomenon in psychiatry that adequately explained the patients' symptoms in several of the most compelling cases was posttraumatic stress disorder. As he noted at the time, this would imply that the patient genuinely believed that the remembered frightening incident had really occurred ‚Äì the position Mack came to endorse. In June 1992, Mack and the physicist David E. Pritchard organized a five-day conference at MIT to discuss and debate the abduction phenomenon. The conference attracted a wide range of professionals, representing a variety of perspectives. Writer C. D. B. Bryan attended the conference, initially intending to gather information for a short humorous article for The New Yorker. While attending the conference, however, Bryan's view of the subject changed, and he wrote a serious, open-minded book on the phenomenon, additionally interviewing many abductees, skeptics, and proponents. Mack's study of numerous cases led him to the conclusion that while investigators should remain open to the possibility of experiences occurring, stories should not be considered to involve actual physical entities and should be treated like subjective witness reports of personal experience. The purported beings would remain outside of physical reality and reports may be influenced by factors like expectations, memory reliability and interviewer suggestions. He also reports similarities to other experiences like OOBE. According to Lance Rivers, he is convinced in the reality of the phenomenon but attributes it to interaction with a spiritual plane. While Mack acknowledges that this leads to problematic speculation on the nature of the beings and their motivations, he concludes that materialist science is inadequate to inquire in those areas.  Abductees  The precise number of alleged abductees is uncertain. One of the earliest studies of abductions found 1,700 claimants, while contested surveys argued that 5‚Äì6 percent of the general population might have been abducted.  Demographics  In a study investigating the motivations of the alleged abductors, Jenny Randles found that in each of the 4 cases out of 50 total where the experiencer was over 40 years of age, they were rejected by the aliens for \\"what they (the experiencers) usually inferred to be a medical reason.\\" Randles concludes \\"[T]he abduction is essentially a young person's experience.\\" Given the reproductive focus of the alleged abductions it is not surprising that one man reported being rejected because he had undergone a vasectomy. It could also be partially because people over the age of 40 are less likely to have \\"hormonic\\" or reproductive activity going on. Although abduction and other UFO-related reports are usually made by adults, sometimes young children report similar experiences.Truncale, Deborah Bruce. \\"Alien/UFO Experiences of Children.\\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. pp. 116‚Äì126. These child-reports often feature very specific details in common with reports of abduction made by adults, including the circumstances, narrative, entities and aftermaths of the alleged occurrences. Often these young abductees have family members who have reported having abduction experiences. Family involvement in the military, or a residence near a military base is also common among child abduction claimants.  Mental health  As a category, some studies show that abductees have psychological characteristics that render their testimony suspect, while others show that \\"as a group, abduction experients are not different from the general population in term of psychopathology prevalence\\". Elizabeth Slater conducted a blind study of nine abduction claimants and found them to be prone to \\"mildly paranoid thinking,\\" nightmares and having a weak sexual identity, while Richard McNally of Harvard Medical School concluded in a similar study of 10 abductees that \\"none of them was suffering from any sort of psychiatric illness.\\"  Political conspiracy theories  Political scientist Michael Barkun, without taking a position on if UFOs and aliens are real, highlighted links between radical politics and conspiracy theories involving UFOs, alien visitation, environmental pollution, hidden groups, government and world takeover. He observed the rise of a form of eclectic and apocalyptic millenarism which he termed \\"improvisional millenarism\\". UFO and abduction stories can often be part of stigmatized or suppressed knowledge narratives, where alleged orthodoxy is claimed to be maintained in error for nefarious purposes and to keep society in ignorance. UFO and alien related conspiracy theories emerged in far-right politics from the 1980s onwards. According to Barkun, in popular culture, TV shows like the X-Files motion picture not only included aliens as part of coverup conspiracies, with militias and black helicopters, but also featured demonization of FEMA, a common target of conspiracy theorists and millenarian scenarios. One conspiracy theory alleges that FEMA plans to suddenly incarcerate \\"patriots\\" in concentration camps during a disaster. Political scientist Jodi Dean noted that the stigma of alien abduction stories is seductive to dismiss \\"consensus reality\\" in favor of deviant alternative realities. Self-described abduction victims often join self-help communities of victims and may resort to questionable regression therapy, similarly to other self-reported victims of child sexual abuse or satanic ritual abuse. Some espouse conspiracy theories of sophisticated technological mind control, including the use of implants, to force them to serve an alleged New World Order, or for the purposes of the antichrist, considering important to warn the world of such imminent danger.  Abduction narrative  Various researchers have noted common points in report narratives. According to CUFOS's definition of abductee, the person must have been taken against their will by apparent non-human beings, taken to a special place perceived as extraterrestrial or to be a spaceship. They then must experience being subjected to an examination or to engage in some form of communication with the beings (or both). Communication may be perceived as telepathic rather than verbal. The memory of the experience may be conscious or \\"recovered\\" through means like hypnosis.Rodeghier, Mark. \\"Who is an Abductee? A Set of Selection Criteria for Abductees.\\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. p. 22. Although different cases vary in detail (sometimes significantly), some UFO researchers, such as folklorist Thomas E. Bullardhis essay is reprinted in Clark 1998 argue that there is a broad, fairly consistent sequence and description of events that make up the typical \\"close encounter of the fourth kind\\" (a popular but unofficial designation building on J. Allen Hynek's classifications). Though the features outlined below are often reported, there is some disagreement as to exactly how often they actually occur. Bullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events. They generally follow the sequence noted below, though not all abductions feature all the events: # Capture. The abductee is somehow rendered incapable of resisting, and taken from terrestrial surroundings to an apparent alien spacecraft. # Examination and Procedures. Invasive physiological and psychological procedures, and on occasion simulated behavioral situations, training & testing, or sexual liaisons. # Conference. The abductors communicate with the abductee or direct them to interact with specific individuals for some purpose, typically telepathically but sometimes using the abductee's native language. # Tour. The abductees are given a tour of their captors' vessel, though this is disputed by some researchers who consider this definition a confabulation of intent when just apparently being taken around to multiple places inside the ship. # Loss of Time. Abductees often rapidly forget the majority of their experience, either as a result of fear, medical intervention, or both. # Return. The abductees are returned to earth, occasionally in a different location from where they were allegedly taken or with new injuries or disheveled clothing. # Theophany. Coinciding with their immediate return, abductees may have a profound sense of love, a \\"high\\" similar to those induced by certain drugs, or a \\"mystical experience\\", accompanied by a feeling of oneness with God, the universe, or their abductors. Whether this is the result of a metaphysical change, Stockholm syndrome, or prior medical tampering is often not scrutinized by the abductees at the time. # Aftermath. The abductee must cope with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience. When describing the \\"abduction scenario\\", David M. Jacobs says: > The entire abduction event is precisely orchestrated. All the procedures are > predetermined. There is no standing around and deciding what to do next. The > beings are task-oriented and there is no indication whatsoever that we have > been able to find of any aspect of their lives outside of performing the > abduction procedures.  Capture  Abduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the onset of an abduction experience.Nyman, Joe. \\"A Composite Encounter Model.\\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. pp. 83‚Äì85. These feelings manifest as a compulsive desire to be at a certain place at a certain time or as expectations that something \\"familiar yet unknown,\\" will soon occur. Abductees also report feeling severe, undirected anxiety at this point even though nothing unusual has actually occurred yet. This period of foreboding can last for up to several days before the abduction actually takes place or be completely absent. Eventually, the experiencer will undergo an apparent \\"shift\\" into an altered state of consciousness. British abduction researchers have called this change in consciousness \\"the Oz Factor.\\" External sounds cease to have any significance to the experiencer and fall out of perception. They report feeling introspective and unusually calm. This stage marks a transition from normal activity to a state of \\"limited self-willed mobility.\\" As consciousness shifts one or more lights are alleged to appear, occasionally accompanied by a strange mist. The source and nature of the lights differ by report; sometimes the light emanates from a source outside the house (presumably the abductors' UFO), sometimes the lights are in the bedroom with the experiencer and transform into alien figures. As the alleged abduction proceeds, claimants say they will walk or be levitated into an alien craft, in the latter case often through solid objects such as walls, ceilings or a closed window. Alternatively, they may experience rising through a tunnel or along a beam of light, with or without the abductors accompanying them, into the awaiting craft.  Examination  The examination phase of the so-called \\"abduction narrative\\" is characterized by the performance of medical procedures and examinations by apparently alien beings against or irrespective of the will of the experiencer. Such procedures often focus on sex and reproductive biology. However, the literature holds reports of a wide variety of procedures allegedly performed by the beings. The entity that appears to be in charge of the operation is often taller than the others involved, and is sometimes described as appearing to be of a different species.Bullard, Thomas E. \\"The Variety of Abduction Beings.\\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. pp. 90‚Äì91. Miller notes different areas of emphasis between human medicine and what is reported as being practiced by the abductors. This could result from a difference in the purpose of the examinationroutine diagnosis and/or treatment versus scientific examination of an unfamiliar species, or it could be due to a different level of technology that renders certain kinds of manual procedures unnecessary. The abductors' areas of interest appear to be the cranium, nervous system, skin, reproductive system, and to a lesser degree, the joints. Systems given less attention than a human doctor would, or omitted entirely include cardiovascular system, the respiratory system below the pharynx and the lymphatic system. The abductors also appear to ignore the upper region of the abdomen in favor of the lower one. The abductors do not appear to wear gloves during the \\"examination.\\" Other constants of terrestrial medicine like pills and tablets are missing from abduction narratives although sometimes abductees are asked to drink liquids. Injections also seem to be rare and IVs are almost completely absent. Miller says he's never heard an abductee claim to have a tongue depressor used on them.  Subsequent procedures  After the so-called medical exam, the alleged abductees often report other procedures being performed with the entities.Jacobs, David M. \\"Subsequent Procedures.\\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. pp. 64‚Äì68. Common among these post-examination procedures are what abduction researchers refer to as imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing. \\"Imaging\\" procedures consist of an abductee being made to view screens displaying images and scenes that appear to be specially chosen with the intent to provoke certain emotional responses in the abductee. \\"Envisioning\\" is a similar procedure, with the primary difference being that the images being viewed, rather than being on a screen, actually seem to be projected into the experiencer's mind. \\"Staging\\" procedures have the abductee playing a more active role, according to reports containing this element. It shares vivid hallucination-like mental visualization with the envisioning procedures, but during staging the abductee interacts with the illusionary scenario like a role player or an actor. \\"Testing\\" marks something of a departure from the above procedures in that it lacks the emotional analysis feature. During testing the experiencer is placed in front of a complicated electronic device and is instructed to operate it. The experiencer is often confused, saying that they do not know how to operate it. However, when they actually set about performing the task, the abductee will find that they do, in fact, know how to operate the machine.  Child presentation  Abductees of all ages and genders sometimes report being subjected to a \\"child presentation.\\" As its name implies, the child presentation involves the abduction claimant being shown a \\"child.\\" Often the children appear to be neither human, nor the same species as the abductors. Instead, the child will almost always share characteristics of both species. These children are labeled by experiencers as hybrids between humans and their abductors, usually Greys. Unlike Budd Hopkins and David Jacobs, folklorist Thomas E. Bullard could not identify a child presentation phase in the abduction narrative, even after undertaking a study of 300 abduction reports.Bullard, Thomas E. \\"The Well-Ordered Abduction: Pattern or Mirage?\\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. pp. 81‚Äì82. Bullard says that the child presentation \\"seems to be an innovation in the story\\" and that \\"no clear antecedents\\" to descriptions of the child presentation phase exist before its popularization by Hopkins and Jacobs.  Less common elements  Bullard also studied the 300 reports of alien abduction in an attempt to observe the less prominent aspects of the claims.Bullard, Thomas E. \\"The Rarer Abduction Episodes.\\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. pp. 72‚Äì74. He notes the emergence of four general categories of events that recur regularly, although not as frequently as stereotypical happenings like the medical examination. These four types of events are: # The conference # The tour # The journey # Theophany Chronologically within abduction reports these rarer episodes tend to happen in the order listed, between the medical examination and the return. After allegedly displaying cold callous disregard towards the abduction experiencers, sometimes the entities will change drastically in behavior once the initial medical exam is completed. They become more relaxed and hospitable towards their captive and lead him or her away from the site of the examination. The entities then hold a conference with the experiencer, wherein they discuss things relevant to the abduction phenomenon. Bullard notes five general categories of discussion that occur during the conference \\"phase\\" of reported abduction narratives: An interrogation session, explanatory segment, task assignment, warnings, and prophecies. Tours of the abductors' craft are a rare but recurring feature of the abduction narrative. The tour seems to be given by the alleged abductors as a courtesy in response to the harshness and physical rigors of the forced medical examination. Sometimes the abductees report traveling on a \\"journey\\" to orbit around Earth or to what appear to be other planets. Some abductees find that the experience is terrifying, particularly if the aliens are of a more fearsome species, or if the abductee was subjected to extensive probing and medical testing.  Return  Eventually the abductors will return the abductees, usually to exactly the same location and circumstances they were in before being taken.Hopkins, Budd. \\"The Abduction Experience: Return.\\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. pp. 77‚Äì80. Usually, explicit memories of the abduction experience will not be present, and the abductee will only realize they have experienced \\"missing time\\" upon checking a timepiece. Sometimes the alleged abductors appear to make mistakes when returning their captives. Famed UFO researcher Budd Hopkins has joked about \\"the cosmic application of Murphy's Law\\" in response to this observation. Hopkins has estimated that these \\"errors\\" accompany 4‚Äì5 percent of abduction reports. One type of common apparent mistake made by the abductors is failing to return the experiencer to the same spot that they were taken from initially. This can be as simple as a different room in the same house, or abductees can even find themselves outside and all the doors of the house are locked from the inside. Another common (and amusing) error is putting the abductee's clothes (e.g. pajamas) on backwards.  Realization event  Physician and abduction researcher John G. Miller sees significance in the reason a person would come to see themselves as being a victim of the abduction phenomenon.Miller, John G. \\"The Realization Event -An Important Historical Feature.\\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. pp. 42‚Äì45. He terms the insight or development leading to this shift in identity from non-abductee to abductee the \\"realization event.\\" The realization event is often a single, memorable experience, but Miller reports that not all abductees experience it as a distinct episode. Either way, the realization event can be thought of as the \\"clinical horizon\\" of the abduction experience.  Trauma and recovery  Most people alleging alien abductions report invasive examinations of their bodies and some ascribe psychological trauma to their experiences. \\"Post abduction syndrome\\" is a term used by abductees to describe the effects of abduction, though it is not recognized by any professional treatment organizations. People who have a false memory which makes them believe that they have been abducted by aliens develop symptoms similar to post-traumatic stress disorder. People who believe they have been abducted by aliens usually have previous New Age beliefs, a vivid fantasy life, and suffer from sleep paralysis, according to a 2003 study by Harvard University.  Support groups  Support groups for people who believed they were abducted began appearing in the mid-1980s. These groups appear throughout the United States, Canada and Australia.  Hypnosis  Many alien abductees recall much of their alleged abduction(s) through hypnosis. Due to the extensive use of hypnosis, and other methods which they view as being manipulative, skeptics explain the abduction narratives as false memories and suggestions.  Criticism  Alleged abductees seek out hypnotherapists to try to resolve issues such as missing time or unexplained physical symptoms such as muscle pain or headaches. This usually involves two phases, an information gathering stage, in which the hypnotherapist asks about unexplained illnesses or unusual phenomena during the patients lives (caused by or distortions of the alleged abduction), followed by hypnosis and guided imagery to facilitate recall. The information gathering enhances the likelihood that the events discussed will be incorporated into later abduction \\"memories\\". Seven steps are hypothesized to lead to the development of false memories: # A person is predisposed to accept the idea that certain puzzling or inexplicable experiences might be telltale signs of UFO abduction. # The person seeks out a therapist, whom he or she views as an authority and who is, at the very least, receptive to this explanation and has some prior familiarity with UFO abduction reports. # Alternatively, the therapist frames the puzzling experiences in terms of an abduction narrative. # Alternative explanations of the experiences are not explored. # There is increasing commitment to the abduction explanation and increasing anxiety reduction associated with ambiguity reduction. # The therapist legitimates or ratifies the abductee's experience, which constitutes additional positive reinforcement. # The client adopts the role of the \\"victim\\" or abductee, which becomes integrated into the psychotherapy and the client's view of self.  Supportive arguments  Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack counters this argument, noting \\"It might be useful to restate that a large proportion of the material relating to abductions is recalled without the use of an altered state of consciousness, and that many abduction reporters appear to relive powerful experiences after only the most minimal relaxation exercise, hardly justifying the word hypnosis at all. The relaxation exercise is useful to relieve the experiencer's need to attend to the social demands and other stimuli of face-to-face conversation, and to relieve the energies involved in repressing memories and emotion.\\"  Perspectives  There have been a variety of explanations offered for abduction phenomena, ranging from sharply skeptical appraisals, to uncritical acceptance of all abductee claims, to the demonological, to everything in between. Some have elected not to try explaining things, instead noting similarities to other phenomena, or simply documenting the development of the alien abduction phenomenon. Others are intrigued by the entire phenomenon, but hesitate in making any definitive conclusions. The late Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack concluded, \\"The furthest you can go at this point is to say there's an authentic mystery here. And that is, I think, as far as anyone ought to go.\\" (emphasis as in original)Bryan, 269 Mack was unconvinced by piecemeal counterclaims, however, and countered that skeptical explanations naturally need to \\"take into account the entire range of phenomena associated with abduction experiences,\\" up to and including \\"missing time,\\" directly contemporaneous UFO sightings, and the occurrence in small children. Putting aside the question of whether abduction reports are literally and objectively \\"real\\", literature professor Terry Matheson argues that their popularity and their intriguing appeal are easily understood. Tales of abduction \\"are intrinsically absorbing; it is hard to imagine a more vivid description of human powerlessness.\\" After experiencing the frisson of delightful terror one may feel from reading ghost stories or watching horror movies, Matheson notes that people \\"can return to the safe world of their homes, secure in the knowledge that the phenomenon in question cannot follow. But as the abduction myth has stated almost from the outset, there is no avoiding alien abductors.\\"Matheson, 297 Matheson writes that when compared to the earlier contactee reports, abduction accounts are distinguished by their \\"relative sophistication and subtlety, which enabled them to enjoy an immediately more favorable reception from the public.\\" Some writers Originally published in 1970 . have said abduction experiences bear similarities to pre-20th century accounts of demonic manifestations, noting as many as a dozen similarities. One notable example is the Orthodox monk Fr. Seraphim Rose, who devotes a whole chapter in his book Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future to the phenomena of UFOs and abductions, which, he concludes, are manifestations of the demonic.  Testimonials  Abduction researcher Brian Thompson claims that a nurse acquaintance of his reported that during 1957 in Cincinnati she encountered a praying mantis-like entity two days after a V-shaped UFO sighting. This mantis-like creature is reminiscent of the insectoid-type entity reported in some abduction accounts. He related this report to fellow researcher Leonard Stringfield. Stringfield told him of two cases he had in his files where separate witnesses reported identical circumstances in the same place and year. While some corroborated accounts seem to support the literal reality of the abduction experience, others seem to support a psychological explanation for the phenomenon's origins. Jenny Randles and Keith Basterfield both noted at the 1992 MIT alien abduction conference that of the five cases they knew of where an abduction researcher was present at the onset of an abduction experience, the experiencer \\"didn't physically go anywhere.\\"Hall, Dick & Randles, Jenny & Basterfield, Keith & Moura, Gilda. \\"Panel on Cross Cultural Patterns in Abductions.\\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. pp. 193‚Äì95. Brazilian researcher Gilda Moura reported on a similar case, the Sueli case, from her home country. When psychologist and UFO researcher Don Donderi said that these cases were \\"evidence of psychological processes\\" that did not \\"have anything to do with a physical alien abduction,\\" Moura replied \\"If the Sueli case is not an abduction, I don't know what is an abduction any more.\\" Gilda Moura noted that in the Brazilian Sueli case during the abduction UFOs were observed. Later, she claims the experiencer had eye burns, saw lights and there seemed to be residual poltergeist activity.  Attempts at confirmation  It has been argued that if actual \\"flesh and blood\\" aliens are abducting humans, there should be some hard evidence that this is occurring. Proponents of the physical reality of the abduction experience have suggested ways that could conceivably confirm abduction reports. One procedure reported occurring during the alleged exam phase of the experience is the insertion of a long needle- like contraption into a woman's navel. Some have speculated that this could be a form of laparoscopy. If this is true, after the abduction there should be free gas in the female's abdomen, which could be seen on an x-ray. The presence of free gas would be extremely abnormal, and would help substantiate the claim of some sort of procedure being done to her.

Bevis held a variety of ministerial, shadow ministerial, and parliamentary leadership positions including Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Shadow Minister for Homeland Security, the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and Chair of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Since leaving parliament, Bevis has served as a Member of the Defence Remuneration Tribunal, the Board of Directors of Defence Housing Australia, and the ANZAC Centenary Advisory Board. Early life and education He was born in Brisbane, and educated at Ithaca Creek State School and The Gap State High School, and graduated as a teacher from the then Brisbane CAE (now QUT). Whilst studying to become a teacher Bevis was president of the Australian Student Teachers Federation. Pre-parliamentary career Bevis worked as a teacher between 1975 and 1977. He became the Queensland President of Young Labor in 1975, aged 20, and went on to become National President of Young Labor in 1978, aged 23. Between 1978 and 1980, Bevis worked as an organiser for the Queensland Teachers Union. In 1980, aged 25, he was promoted to Deputy General Secretary, a position he held until 1990. From 1988‚Äì90, he was also a member of the Labor Party's national executive. He was elected Vice-President of the Australian Labor Party from 2000‚Äì02. Parliamentary career Bevis in June 2007 After being elected to the House of Representatives at the 1990 election, Bevis served on a number of committees. He chaired the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology from 1992‚Äì93 and the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters from 1992‚Äì94. From 1994 to 1996, he was also the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Defence.

Located on the corner of Washington Road and Prospect Avenue, Campus was founded in 1900. It was one of the eating clubs that abandoned the selective bicker process to choose members non-selectively, a status it held for over twenty years. In an attempt to restore the waning popularity of the club, the club's board pressured the undergraduate officers to reinstate bicker in 2004, causing Campus to become one of six selective clubs (out of eleven total clubs). However, due to the unpopularity of bicker among its members, the club returned to being a sign-in club in the spring of 2005. Facing another year of exceptionally low membership and resulting financial trouble, Campus Club closed later the same year. In November 2005, the former members and alumni of Campus Club voted to donate the building to the University, under the condition that the mansion remain a social venue for Princeton students. After undergoing renovations for over two years, Campus Club reopened on September 18, 2009, as a clubhouse open to all members of the Princeton community.

McClenahan '02. In January 1901, the newly elected members of Campus Club began negotiations to purchase the residence of Professor Andrew Fleming West, which was located at the corner of Washington Road and Prospect Avenue (where Campus Club stands today). The club members financed the purchase of the West house through sale of approximately $45,000 of \\"Princeton Campus Club Bonds.\\" Once the residence was acquired, the new members began using the West residence as their clubhouse.Id. The West residence as it stands today. This building served as the original Princeton Campus Club from approximately 1901-1910.

In 1909, the members of Campus Club elected to construct a new clubhouse, and the original West house was moved to the corner of Nassau Street and Princeton Avenue.

He was a prominent figure in alien abduction phenomena and related UFO research.  Life  Elliot Budd Hopkins was born in 1931. He was raised in Wheeling, West Virginia. He lived with his parents, Elliot B. Hopkins and Eleanor A. Hopkins, brother, Stuart, and sister, Eleanor. At age two, Hopkins contracted polio. During the long recovery process, Hopkins developed an interest in drawing and watercolors, which eventually led him to Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in art history in 1953. It was here, Hopkins was exposed to art with \\"a capital A\\", and attended a lecture by Robert Motherwell that first introduced him to the \\"automatic, gestural approach that Motherwell espoused.\\" From Oberlin, Hopkins moved to New York City, where he met Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning and other abstract expressionists. For a time, Hopkins studied art history at Columbia University and worked a low-level job selling tickets at the Museum of Modern Art. His experimentation with collage techniques and style as an abstract expressionist, won him national acclaim. Hopkins' first solo show was held in New York City in 1956, the same year he met and married his first wife of thirteen years, Joan Rich. In 1976, Hopkins was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for painting. He also received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts . His articles on art appeared in magazines and journals, and he lectured at many art schools, including Truro Center for the Arts at Castle Hill. In 1993 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1994. After the publication of his book Missing Time in 1981, his UFO research began to take precedence over his art. As a self-described humanist, Hopkins saw his work with alleged alien abduction victims as a way to bring attention to an otherwise marginalized part of society. His follow-up book Intruders: The Incredible Visitations at Copley Woods, published in 1987, helped establish Hopkins as a prominent leader in the UFO movement. By 1973, Hopkins was married to art critic April Kingsley, with whom he had a daughter, Grace Hopkins Their marriage ended in divorce in 1991. In 1989, Hopkins organized the Intruders Foundation in Manhattan to provide support for alleged victims of alien abduction, conduct research and investigations, and promote public awareness of the phenomenon. The organization became inactive after his death in 2011. The 1992 made-for-television film Intruders featured fictionalized characters based on the works of Hopkins and psychiatrist John E. Mack, and, like Hopkins' book of the same name, portrayed abduction scenes. Budd Hopkins with former wife and co-author, Carol Rainey, 1996. In 1994, Hopkins met writer, filmmaker Carol Rainey, who became his third wife in 1996. They shared a mutual fascination with alien abduction stories and, according to Rainey, possibility that people on Earth may have been \\"seeded here by highly advanced beings or a Big Being from 'out there'.\\" The two co-wrote a book Sight Unseen, Science, UFO Invisibility and Transgenic Beings, which was published in 2003. They were married for 10 years. Also in 1996, Hopkins' book Witnessed: The True Story of the Brooklyn Bridge UFO Abductions was published. The book portrayed an abduction case that was alleged to have occurred in late 1989 near the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City. On August 21, 2011, Hopkins died from complications of cancer. At the time of his death, he was in a relationship with journalist Leslie Kean.  Art  Hopkins' paintings in the 1960s combined the precise, hard-edge geometric shapes he was enthralled with and drawn to as a child with gestural, atmospheric painting characteristic of second- and later-generation Abstract Expressionists. \\"I had come to understand that an abstract painting at its most powerful was a kind of aesthetic scrim behind which lurks a concealed, obsessive 'thing' or image of some kind, transformed, made palatable by the artist's mediating skills.\\" Hopkins viewed collage as an artistic technique and a philosophical, aesthetic means of unifying a disjointed and fragmented world. He saw collage, the assemblage of fragments and varying points of view, in the poetry, painting, sculpture, music, architecture, and, especially, motion pictures of his day: > \\"Consciously or unconsciously, contemporary artists work to create harmony > from distinctly jarring material, forcing warring ideas, materials and > spatial systems into a tense and perhaps arbitrary detente. Seen most > broadly, the presence of the collage aesthetic is the sole defining quality > of modernism in all the arts.\\" Hopkins worked to achieve harmony, clarity and precision while maintaining a sense of mystery: > \\"I like neither extreme in art wholeheartedly, neither the purified world of > geometrical art nor the free, indulgent world of Expressionism.\\" In 1963, Hopkins' work was included in American Painters, a film documentary of American artists and styles with commentary from Alfred Barr of the Museum of Modern Art, Thomas Hess of Art News Magazine, Sidney Janis, gallery director, and Harold Rosenberg, art critic. In 1969, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art acquired Hopkin's Norbeck Yellow Vertical, describing him as \\"a leading American painter who has successfully brought together the vocabularies of painterly abstraction and hard edge painting.\\" In 1972, Hopkins was among five artists whose work was commissioned as part of a statewide effort to support the creative arts in West Virginia. It was, Governor Arch Moore claimed, \\"the first project of this kind to be undertaken in the nation.\\" The piece was to be displayed in the state's cultural center located near the Capitol. Also in the 1970s, Hopkins' work included a series of Assembled Paintings, incorporating architectural elements. Sculptures such as Gallatin's Drive I, White City Hall, New York Wall II and others bore urban names and echoed elements of New York City's skyline. Many of his works during this time featured circular shapes with primary colors set against black and white backgrounds suggestive of Piet Mondrian. Later, Hopkins included abstracted figures in his sculptural pieces. While moving away from Abstract Expressionism, Hopkins retained in his work the use of intense colors and hard-edged forms. His works of the 1980s, including Temples and Guardians, featured these \\"sentinals\\" who were, according to Hopkins, \\"participating in a frozen ritual, fixedabsolutelywithin a privileged space...\\" Though Hopkins denied any connection, some critics viewed these ritualistic pieces as an extension of Hopkins' fascination with alien beings. Hopkins viewed his sculpted guardians not as human per se, but as magical, fierce, noble robots of the unconscious. Hopkins exhibited his paintings and sculptures in museums, galleries such as Andre Zarre, Levis Fine Art and Poindexter (New York) and Jan Cicero (Chicago), and universities throughout the United States. Hopkins had a major retrospective exhibition at the Provincetown Art Association and Museum in the summer of 2017. The Whitney Museum, Washington Gallery of Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, Corcoran Gallery of Art, the British Museum, include Hopkins' work in their permanent collections.  Interest in UFOs  As a child, Hopkins experienced, firsthand, Orson Welles' 1938 radio play The War of the Worlds. This both terrified Hopkins and his family and left psychic scars. He considered the radio play a dramatic, theatrical hoax and, because of his childhood scare, felt it added to his skepticism about alien invasions rather than enamor him to the idea of it. His interest in UFOs and alien visitations was renewed when, in August 1964, Hopkins and two others reported experiencing a day time sighting of an unidentified flying object, or UFO, in the form of a darkish, elliptical object off Cape Cod in Truro, MA. Dissatisfied with the response Hopkins received when he reported the incident to nearby Otis Air National Guard Base, he suspected a possible government cover-up. Hopkins began reading about UFOs and collecting stories of people who claimed to have experienced contact with alien beings. He also joined the now-defunct UFO research group National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). In 1975, Hopkins was approached by George O'Barski who, purportedly, witnessed alien figures step out of a spacecraft and take soil samples at North Hudson Park in North Bergen, New Jersey. Hopkins, Ted Bloecher, then director of New York State's Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), and Jerry Stoehrer, also of MUFON, investigated the incident, interviewing the witness and taking soil samples. After Hopkins' account of the O'Barski case appeared in The Village Voice in 1976, he began receiving regular letters from other UFO witnesses, including a few cases of missing time, seemingly inexplicable gaps in abductees' memories. Hopkins, using data from his investigations with Bloecher and psychologist Aphrodite Clamar, expanded this idea in his book Missing Time. Behavioral patterns extrapolated from abductee letters led Hopkins to identify core emotional responses based on their experiences: fear, awe or wonderment at alien technological abilities, affection toward their captors (which he likened to the \\"Patty Hearst\\" syndrome), anger, and helplessness. He believed aliens were either incapable of understanding the psychological effects of their encounters with humans or that they were a \\"callous, indifferent, amoral race bent solely upon gratifying its own scientific needs at whatever cost to us.\\" Hopkins told researchers and professors at a UFO conference in Brasilia, Brazil: > \\"The aliens of the book War of the Worlds and those of Independence Day do > not exist. They are not out to destroy the planet. Neither are they the > benevolent, seeking to help mankind with their advanced knowledge. It seems > to me they come here to treat us as one gigantic experiment because they are > having problems re-creating.\\"  Alien abduction  Budd Hopkins and John Mack, hypnosis session, Istanbul. Hopkins is often credited with popularizing the idea of alien abductions as genetic experimentation through the publication of his book Intruders. He has been dubbed \\"father of the abduction movement\\" by some. Hopkins, along with Elizabeth Slater who conducted psychological tests of abductees, likened these experiences to rape, specifically for the purpose of human reproductive capabilities. In fact, Hopkins was inclined to dismiss his clients' conscious memory of abuse for more alien explanations. He was an alarmist, rather than a spiritualist, in his approach to the alien visitations, believing the visitations to be apocalyptic and that no good could come of these encounters. He described victims' experiences as severe and nightmarish. While both men and women reported to Hopkins abductions by aliens that included sexual encounters, allegedly for some form of extraterrestrial eugenics, women in particular seemed to be a part of a \\"highly technological colonization scheme.\\" These victims were, reportedly, taken to spaceships, impregnated by extraterrestrials, then later as the hybrid baby developed, returned to the ship to have the fetus removed and given up to the alien parent. The alien parents, purportedly, had the ability to communicate telepathically with their child. On occasion, according to victims' reports as told by Hopkins, the human parents were allowed to see their human-alien hybrid, or transgenic, children. Once a victim, according to Hopkins, abductees were powerless over the intrusions and susceptible to additional kidnappings which may extend to their (human) children. \\"If people have had one abduction experience,\\" Hopkins said,\\" then they will have others.\\" Critics of Hopkins' assertions about alien abductions contend that the alien abduction phenomenon is not as mysterious as Hopkins makes it out to be. Much of the phenomenon can, according to researchers such as Ronald K. Siegel of the University of California, Los Angeles, be explained as the consequence of \\"normal hallucinatory powers of the brain.\\" Sleep paralysis, for example, can produce the feeling that one is paralyzed or has difficulty moving. It can also produce the effect of floating or the sense of an out-of-body experience. Sleep paralysis occurs in a transition time and the person is in a dream-like state, hallucinations can occur just before falling asleep (hynogogic hallucination) or just after (hypnopompic hallucination). These hallucinations feel real to the person experiencing sleep paralysis and can often be accompanied by sensory features: musty smells, shuffling sounds, visions of ghosts, aliens, and monsters. Neuroscientist Michael Persinger of Laurentian University in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, believes that these sensations can spontaneously occur in some people, given the right set of circumstances, leading to the kind of feelings of \\"tremendous meaningfulness and fear\\" sometimes expressed by alleged alien abductees. Hopkins rejected the idea of sleep paralysis, calling it \\"the big explanation du jour\\", and an inadequate explanation for those who experience abductions outside the bedroom.  Roper poll  Hopkins partnered with David M. Jacobs, history professor at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, and John Mack, psychiatry professor at Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, to design a Roper poll to find out how many of the nearly 6,000 respondents surveyed had experienced what the three believed to be symptoms indicative of alien abductions. The poll was released in 1991. If generalized to the population at large, the survey results indicated that several million Americans are regularly affected by alien abductions. Critics of the survey questioned the validity of the survey questions themselves and pointed out the implausibility that an average of 340 Americans could be abducted daily, given the fact that no physical evidence to date exists for any UFO abduction.  Support groups  Hopkins with new abductee. Hopkins met and encouraged self- proclaimed abductees to discuss their experiences by holding free monthly group therapy sessions. Groups such as this were reported at the time as the most recent development in UFO-mania. Attendees represented people from all walks of life: attorneys, policemen, teachers, airline pilots, psychologists, psychiatrists, and the like. Drawing as many as 20 people each month, these support meetings were, according to Hopkins, like other New York social events, complete with \\"dinner and a lot of social chatter.\\" Hopkins, trained as an artist not as a psychotherapist or social worker, described the people who attended these groups as veterans of trauma. They were, in his view, victims who experienced often intrusive and painful physical examinations by their alien abductors and whose stories were best told through hypnosis. Abduction memories, according to Hopkins, rarely emerged unaided and may, at first, present to the abductees as \\"vague anxieties, specific phobias, bad dreams, fragmentary and disturbing memories, or what seemed like an explicable episode of missing time.\\" Many of his attendees contacted Hopkins after reading his books or newspaper advertisements that included his books as reference material, seeing him on television programs such as Will Shriner, Sally Jessy Raphael, the Marsha Warfield Show, Charles Grodin and others. Some critics interpreted these television appearances as a way for Hopkins and other UFO authors such as Whitley Strieber to recruit possible abductees. Still other support group members attended the many UFO conferences held within the United States and internationally at which Hopkins was a speaker.  Hypnosis  Hopkins, hypnosis with abductee. Although Hopkins had no formal psychological training, he watched other professionals over an eight-year period and developed his own techniques. In his opinion, these professionals, notably Robert Naiman, Aphrodite Clamar and Girard Franklin were quite skeptical of the reality of abduction claims, yet all uncovered detailed abduction scenarios from their patients. According to Hopkins, any feeling of uneasiness about a place, or any sense of lost time (that is often accounted for by daydreaming), could be attributed to alien abduction. He believed aliens were capable of blocking or submerging memories in the people they abducted. Despite critics' warnings that practices such as the ones in which Hopkins engaged may cause serious psychological damage to the alleged abductees, Hopkins insisted that regressive hypnosis could unlock the experiences of his clients. He gave little credence to experts such as psychologist Robert A. Baker, University of Kentucky, whose scientific inquiries into the subject revealed that hypnosis can \\"transform a dream, a hallucination or fantasy into a seemingly-real event.\\" This transformation is known as the fabrication of spurious memories and is particularly common under hypnosis. By 1995, Hopkins had worked with hundreds of abductees, It was during these hypnosis sessions that Hopkins' belief in UFO abduction deepened. To him, the purported similarities among client stories lent credibility to the abductees' stories. In actuality, the details of abductee stories varied greatly. The idea of repressed memories has, largely, been dismissed by the scientific community. Psychological research demonstrates that, rather than forget what has happened in a traumatic event, most people find they are unable to stop thinking about it. What concerns critics is that the details of UFO abduction stories, such as the ones Hopkins describes in his work, usually occur only after consultation with some sort of UFO investigator who already has an inclination to believe in alien abduction scenarios. UFO critic Philip J. Klass characterizes these practices as a dangerous game. UFO abductee stories are well-documented in the psychological literature and are considered culturally based. In other parts of the world, fairies, leprechauns, and other creatures replace aliens as abductors. Some liken extraterrestrial abduction to a secular version of the religious dream. According to Baker, \\"These people are literally talked into believing they've been abducted.\\" The hypnotist can also, knowingly or unknowingly, create \\"memories\\" of an event that never occurred in their patients. In May 1987, psychologist and hypnotist Martin Reiser appeared on ABC's 20/20 with host Lynn Sherr, an episode that also featured Hopkins and alleged UFO abductees, asserting that there are reasonable explanations for UFO sightings. His belief was that Hopkins pressured his subjects into believing UFOs exist. Elizabeth Loftus, on NOVA's Kidnapped by UFOs?, which aired on April 1, 1997 and included a taped hypnosis session conducted by Hopkins, identified \\"subtle but powerful suggestive cues\\" as Hopkins worked with two children as part of the investigative portion of the show. She cautioned that someone convinced of a false memory, can react emotionally to it and elaborate on the story as if it were real. Social psychologist Richard Ofshe concurred that suggestive influence may be a factor in Hopkins' support groups. Of Hopkins' book, Intruders, Bettyann Kevles of The New York Times wrote: \\"I am willing to believe that he believes everything he has written. I am also willing to believe that Kathie and the others experienced inexplicable time losses and strange dreams that may have not been dreams. But I am wary of the accuracy of the information he gathered through hypnosis. This kind of testimony is disallowed in most courts because hypnosis is not thoroughly understood and has proved unreliable as a source of evidence. Witnesses recall events that never occurred, but that they are later, on being brought out of hypnosis, convinced really happened.\\" Hopkins responded to critics by saying, \\"I have often frequently invited interested therapists, journalists and academics to observe hypnosis sessions. Theoretical psychologist Nicholas Humphrey, who has held teaching positions at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities, and psychiatrist Donald F. Klein, director of research at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and professor of psychiatry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, are but two of those who have observed my work firsthand. None of these visitors ... have reported anything that suggested I was attempting to lead the subjects.\\"  Evidence  Scars from different \\"abductees\\" Physical proof of alien abduction for Hopkins, came in the form of scoop marks, or indentations of the skin, scars or cuts on the mouth, nose, ears or genital, or unexplained bruises that might clear up in a day, and abductee claims of implants interpreted as control or monitoring devices similar to those used by (human) scientists to track and tag animals in the wild. He also believed the alien spacecraft left marks on the ground where they landed and that the aliens could be photographed. Anecdotal proof of alien sightings or abductions, which Hopkins considered \\"tightly imagined testimonies\\" by abductees, included victims' stories of observing unconventional objects in the sky, witnessing unusual activity (such as aliens digging for soil samples), flying through the air or being transported to a ship, a sense of being watched or the presence of hooded beings near the bed at night, a sense of paralysis or immobilization while lying in bed or in their cars, impressions of flying or passing through closed windows or walls, a feeling of having been outside upon awakening, invisibility (both alien and human) and, most especially, a sense of missing or lost time. Hopkins believed in his data collection techniques, as outlined in Missing Time, and insisted, despite questions from other researchers and skeptics, that his findings were solidly based in evidence that, cumulatively, was overwhelming. Despite Hopkins' oft- repeated assertion of \\"powerful evidence\\" for alien abduction, critics plagued his career with calls for tangible proof, which were never forthcoming: DNA from the hybrid babies, proof of implants that were alluded to (particularly in the Cortile case) but never recovered, photographs or videotapes of space craft or aliens. Critics, including his former wife, Rainey, expressed concern that UFO researcher leaders were not held to scholastic, scientific, or ethical standards. Still others question whether it would be likely that alien abductors could actually float people through solid walls and, if they could, wonder at how these people could escape detection, particularly in urban settings where there would, potentially, be millions of people around to witness the event. Hopkins' response to the lack of UFO sightings by bystanders was to suggest that aliens could make themselves and their abductees invisible. The lack of physical evidence and the inconsistencies and implausibility of the alien abduction stories lead some critics, including Carl Sagan and author Jodi Dean, to question whether these memories are the product of internal, rather than external experiences.  Popular culture  Critics of Hopkins' assertions that these alien abduction stories had \\"an absolute core of reality\\" cautioned that media coverage might, inadvertently, be influencing alleged victims' stories. For example, The UFO Incident, a movie based on the Betty and Barney Hill case, aired on October 20, 1975 and exposed millions of viewers to the idea of alien abduction. Just one month later, O'Barski, Hopkins' neighbor and a New York City liquor store owner, approached him about seeing a spacecraft that, allegedly, landed in New Jersey's North Hudson Park. Strieber's book, Communion (1987), topped The New York Times' best-seller list, as did Hopkins' Intruders: The Incredible Visitations at Copley Woods (1987), and prompted stories of alien abduction by people who read the books. Cortile had also participated in Hopkins' support group, starting five months before her alleged abduction, and read his book, Intruders. Conspiracy theories of government coverup of UFO sightings and visitations, such as the ones depicted in Nighteyes and Witnessed fueled the imaginations of those who belonged to UFO groups at the time. Some say the public's interest in UFOs may have faded after the Cold War had it not been for the media's depiction of and public sympathy for traumatized alien abductee television portrayals in the 1980s and 1990s. Even Hopkins admitted that media attention had a way of \\"contaminating the pool\\" of subjects, but felt he was able to cull the delusional stories from those he believed to be real. For him, the repetition of certain experiences by abductees lent credibility to their stories. For Hopkins, these accounts were not fantasy.

He was a legendary long-distance rider, who won 400 races, and was recognized by his contemporaries as supporting the preservation of the mustang. Though the film Hidalgo was based on Hopkins' purported story. Few items in his accounts have been verified by outside, reliable, third-party sources that some experts consider him to be a con-artist.Hidalgo from myth to movie by Basha O‚ÄôReilly thelongridersguild.com Early life and education Hopkins said he was born to a Lakota mother and European-American father, that he grew up in both cultures, and that he learned to ride and care for horses at an early age. He claimed that his father, Charles Hopkins, was a scout for George Armstrong Custer and he was captured by Chief Gall in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, but he was released four months later and returned to Fort Laramie, which is where Frank said he was born and raised (his father being with Custer cannot be substantiated). The Fort Laramie National Historic site has no record of his birth or family. There is a marriage certificate that Hopkins signed in New York in 1929 where his age was put at 44 which, if true, would place his birth in 1885. However, the photograph shown, said to have been taken in 1905, seems to show the appearance of a middle-aged man. Career Hopkins claimed to have been a cowboy and professional horseman in the American West, where he gained a reputation for distance riding. In his autobiographical memoir (unpublished in his lifetime) and accounts to friends, he claimed to have been featured as one of the \\"Rough Riders of the World\\" in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, which toured in Europe as well as the United States.Peter Harrigan, \\"Hidalgo: A Film or Flimflam?\\", in Arab News, 13 May 2003, accessed 2010-12-28 A number of his stories have been debunked by many historians. Examples include: * His claim to have won more than 400 races. * His claim to have raced in a ceremonial 3,000-mile ride that passed the Gulf of Syria and the inland borders of two other Middle Eastern countries, which was supposed to have taken place in Arabia in 1890. * His claim to have been a rider with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show was disputed by the curator of the Buffalo Bill Historical Center, who said Hopkins' name is nowhere to be found in the archives. Hopkins has been found as listed in 1917 as being employed by the Ringling Brothers Circus as a horse handler. * His claim to have brought 'trick riding' to Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show has been disputed by the Georgian Cossack expert, Irakli Makharadze. In 1926 Hopkins was foreman of a construction crew, digging a subway tunnel in downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In the 1940s, Hopkins claimed he was honorary chair at a Vermont Races, though the Vermont Historical Society has no knowledge of any races in Vermont. Hopkins also claimed to have won a Texas-to-Vermont endurance race at age 21, riding an 800-pound buckskin, but there is no evidence in contemporary sources that such a race was ever held. Up to the time of his death in 1951, he remained an outspoken champion of the threatened mustang which he called \\"the most significant animal on the North American continent.\\" Death Frank Hopkins is interred in Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery in Middle Village, Queens County, New York.

Popular for its work on college campuses during the 1950s, Brubeck's group reached new heights with Morello. In June 1959, Morello participated in a recording session with the quartet‚Äîcompleted by the alto saxophonist Paul Desmond and the bassist Eugene Wright‚Äîthat yielded \\"Kathy's Waltz\\" and \\"Three to Get Ready\\", both of which intermingled 3/4 and 4/4 time signatures. Biography Morello suffered from partial vision from birth, and devoted himself to indoor activities. At six years old, he began studying the violin. Three years later, he was a featured soloist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, playing Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto, and again three years later. At the age of 15, Morello met the violinist Jascha Heifetz and decided that he would never be able to equal Heifetz's \\"sound\\". Therefore, he switched to drumming, first studying with a show drummer named Joe Sefcik and then George Lawrence Stone, author of the noted drum textbook Stick Control for the Snare Drummer. Stone was so impressed with Morello's ideas that he incorporated them into his next book, Accents & Rebounds, which is dedicated to Morello. Later, Morello studied with Radio City Music Hall percussionist Billy Gladstone. After moving to New York City, Morello worked with numerous notable jazz musicians including Johnny Smith, Tal Farlow, Stan Kenton, Phil Woods, Sal Salvador, Marian McPartland, Jay McShann, Art Pepper, and Howard McGhee. After a period of playing in McPartland's trio, Morello declined invitations to join both Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey's bands, favoring a temporary two-month tour with the Dave Brubeck Quartet in 1955. Morello remained with Brubeck for well over a decade, departing in 1968. Morello later became an in-demand clinician, teacher and bandleader whose former students include Danny Gottlieb, TigerBill Meligari, Bruce Springsteen E Street Band drummer Max Weinberg, Rich Galichon, Phish drummer Jon Fishman, Gary Feldman, Patrick Wante, Tony Woo, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons drummer Gerry Polci, Jerry Granelli, RIOT drummer Sandy Slavin, retired Army Blues drummer Steve Fidyk, Glenn Johnson, Pittsburgh drummer Bennett Carlise, Level System author and professional drummer Jeff W. Johnson,https://www.worldcat.org/title/level-system-natural- method-for-developing-control-of-accents-and- dynamics/oclc/937838623&referer;=brief_results and Bon Jovi drummer Tico Torres. Morello appeared in many Brubeck performances and contributed to over 60 albums with Brubeck. On \\"Take Five\\", he plays an imaginative drum solo maintaining the 5/4 time signature throughout. Another example of soloing in odd time signatures can be heard on \\"Unsquare Dance\\", in which he solos using only sticks without drums in 7/4 time. At the end of the track, he can be heard laughing about the \\"trick\\" ending. He also features on \\"Blue Rondo √† la Turk\\", \\"Strange Meadow Lark\\", \\"Pick-Up Sticks\\" and \\"Castilian Drums\\". During his career, Morello appeared on over 120 albums. He authored several drum books, including Master Studies, published by Modern Drummer Publications, and also made instructional videos. Morello was the recipient of many awards, including Playboy magazine's best drummer award for seven years in a row, and Down Beat magazine's best drummer award five years in a row. He was elected to the Modern Drummer magazine Hall of Fame in 1988, the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 1993, and was the recipient of Hudson Music's first TIP (Teacher Integration Program) Lifetime Achievement award in June, 2010.\\"Joe Morello: TIP Lifetime Achievement Award\\" June 3, 2010 Hudson Music News, June 15, 2010. Retrieved March 13, 2010 Morello died at his home in Irvington, New Jersey, on March 12, 2011, aged 82, and is interred at Saint Michael Cemetery. Upon his death, Morello's wife gave control of Joe Morello's memorabilia and collections to Marvin Burock, one of Joe's students who had toured extensively with Morello and who was tasked with transcribing Morello's Modern Drummer articles for ten years, .

Macular edema occurs when fluid and protein deposits collect on or under the macula of the eye (a yellow central area of the retina) and causes it to thicken and swell (edema). The swelling may distort a person's central vision, because the macula holds tightly packed cones that provide sharp, clear, central vision to enable a person to see detail, form, and color that is directly in the centre of the field of view. Cause The causes of macular edema are numerous and different causes may be inter-related. *It is commonly associated with diabetes. Chronic or uncontrolled diabetes type 2 can affect peripheral blood vessels including those of the retina which may leak fluid, blood and occasionally fats into the retina causing it to swell. *Age-related macular degeneration may cause macular edema. As individuals age there may be a natural deterioration in the macula which can lead to the depositing of drusen under the retina sometimes with the formation of abnormal blood vessels. *Replacement of the lens as treatment for cataract can cause pseudophakic macular edema. (‚Äòpseudophakia‚Äô means ‚Äòreplacement lens‚Äô) also known as Irvine-Gass syndrome The surgery involved sometimes irritates the retina (and other parts of the eye) causing the capillaries in the retina to dilate and leak fluid into the retina. Less common today with modern lens replacement techniques. *Chronic uveitis and intermediate uveitis can be a cause. *Blockage of a vein in the retina can cause engorgement of the other retinal veins causing them to leak fluid under or into the retina. The blockage may be caused, among other things, by atherosclerosis, high blood pressure and glaucoma. *A number of drugs can cause changes in the retina that can lead to macular edema. The effect of each drug is variable and some drugs have a lesser role in causation. The principal medication known to affect the retina are:- latanoprost, epinephrine, rosiglitazone, timolol and thiazolidinediones among others. *A few congenital diseases are known to be associated with macular edema for example retinitis pigmentosa and retinoschisis. Diagnosis Classification Cystoid macular edema (CME). There are intraretinal cystoid spaces Cystoid macular edema (CME) involves fluid accumulation in the outer plexiform layer secondary to abnormal perifoveal retinal capillary permeability. The edema is termed \\"cystoid\\" as it appears cystic; however, lacking an epithelial coating, it is not truly cystic. The cause for CME can be remembered with the mnemonic \\"DEPRIVEN\\" (diabetes, epinepherine, pars planitis, retinitis pigmentosa, Irvine-Gass syndrome, venous occlusion, E2-prostaglandin analogues, nicotinic acid/niacin). Diabetic macular edema (DME) is similarly caused by leaking macular capillaries. DME is the most common cause of visual loss in both proliferative, and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Treatment Macular edema sometimes occurs for a few days or weeks after cataract surgery, but most such cases can be successfully treated with NSAID or cortisone eye drops. Prophylactic use of Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported to reduce the risk of macular edema to some extent. Diabetic macular edema may be treated with laser photocoagulation, reducing the chance of vision loss. In 2010, the US FDA approved the use of Lucentis intravitreal injections for macular edema. Iluvien, a sustained release intravitreal implant developed by Alimera Sciences, has been approved in Austria, Portugal and the U.K. for the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic diabetic macular edema (DME) considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies. Additional EU country approvals are anticipated. OSN SuperSite, June 7, 2012. Retrieved June 20, 2012 In 2013 Lucentis by intravitreal injection was approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK for the treatment of macular edema caused by diabetes and/or retinal vein occlusion. On July 29, 2014, Eylea (aflibercept), an intravitreal injection produced by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., was approved to treat DME in the United States. Research In 2005, steroids were investigated for the treatment of macular edema due to retinal blood vessel blockage such as CRVO and BRVO. A 2014 Cochrane Systematic Review studied the effectiveness of two anti-VEGF treatments, ranibizumab and pegaptanib, on patients suffering from macular edema caused by CRVO. Participants on both treatment groups showed a reduction in macular edema symptoms over six months. Another Cochrane Review examined the effectiveness and safety of two intravitreal steroid treatments, triamcinolone acetonide and dexamethasone, for patients with from CRVO-ME. The results from one trial showed that patients treated with triamcinolone acetonide were significantly more likely to show improvements in visual acuity than those in the control group, though outcome data was missing for a large proportion of the control group. The second trial showed that patients treated with dexamethasone implants did not show improvements in visual acuity, compared to patients in the control group. Evidence also suggests that intravitreal injections and implantation of steroids inside the eye can result in improved visual outcomes for patients with chronic or refractory diabetic macular edema. There is low certainty evidence that there does not appear to be any additional benefit of combining anti-VEGF and intravitreal steroids when compared to either treatment alone. Anti‚Äêtumour necrosis factor agents have been proposed as a treatment for macular oedema due to uveitis but a Cochrane Review published in 2018 found no relevant randomised controlled trials.

Population: Lomonosov is the site of the 18th-century royal Oranienbaum park and palace complex, notable as being the only palace in the vicinity of Saint Petersburg that was not captured by Nazi Germany during World War II.  History  Oranienbaum was granted town status in 1710, and was initially applied to the Oranienbaum palace complex, built between 1710 and 1725 opposite Kronstadt, in the neighbourhood of the royal residence Peterhof Palace, by the architects Giovanni Mario Fontana and Gottfried Johann Schadel, and was intended for Alexander Menshikov, a close associate of Peter the Great. The original name of the town translates to \\"orange tree\\" in German (in modern German, the word is Orangenbaum), and is believed to have been derived from the palace complex which had greenhouses to grow exotic plants such as orange trees. According to another version, the name means ‚ÄúTree of Orange‚Äù in honour of William III of Orange, king of England and governor of the Netherlands, who was the idol of Peter the Great, or it was borrowed from the toponymy of Germany (the city of Oranienbaum in the Principality of Anhalt named by Princess Henrietta Katharina Nassau-Oransky after her home place) simply as a ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù name in the fashion spirit of the Petrine era. During World War II the town was heavily involved in the Siege of Leningrad, where Red Army forces managed to establish a foothold at Oranienbaum, in the rear of the forces of Nazi Germany. This foothold had a major importance in the launching of the Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive in early 1944, which finally ended the siege (see Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive). In 1948, the town was renamed to its current name Lomonosov, in honor of the scientist, poet and glassblower Mikhail Lomonosov. In 1754, Lomonosov had founded a colored-glass factory near Oranienbaum, in the village of Ust-Ruditsa. An unofficial nickname, Rambov, a Russified contraction of the old name Oranienbaum, is popular among the local residents. Lomonosov can be reached by suburban train from St. Petersburg's Baltic Terminal to Oranienbaum Station.

Biography Early life Patterson was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His family was musical; his mother sang with Jimmie Lunceford. His brother, Muhammad Ali, is also a drummer, who played with Albert Ayler. Ali, his brother, and his father converted to Islam. Starting off as a pianist he eventually took up the drums, via trumpet and trombone. He joined the United States Army and played with military bands during the Korean War. After his military service, he returned home and studied with Philly Joe Jones, then toured with Sonny Rollins. Career Ali moved to New York in 1963 and worked in groups with Bill Dixon and Paul Bley. He was scheduled to be the second drummer alongside Elvin Jones on John Coltrane's free jazz album Ascension, but he dropped out just before the recording was to take place. Coltrane did not replace him and settled for one drummer. Ali recorded with Coltrane beginning in 1965 on the album Meditations. Among his credits are the last recorded work by Coltrane (The Olatunji Concert) and Interstellar Space, an album of duets recorded earlier in 1967. Ali \\"became important in stimulating the most avant-garde kinds of jazz activitie,\\" playing what Coltrane described as \\"multi- directional rhythms\\". After Coltrane's death, Ali performed with his widow, pianist Alice Coltrane. During the early 1970s, he ran Ali's Alley, a loft club in New York City. Rashied Ali in a duo with Billy Bang at the Koncept Cultural Gallery, Oakland, California, July 26, 1991 He was a visiting artist at Wesleyan University, sponsored by Clifford Thornton. He also briefly formed a non-jazz group called Purple Trap with Japanese experimental guitarist Keiji Haino and jazz-fusion bassist Bill Laswell. Their album, Decided...Already the Motionless Heart of Tranquility, Tangling the Prayer Called \\"I\\", was released by Tzadik Records in March 1999. In the 1980s, he was member of Phalanx, a group with guitarist James Blood Ulmer, tenor saxophonist George Adams, and bassist Sirone. From 1997‚Äì2003 he played extensively with Tisziji Munoz in a group that usually included Pharoah Sanders. Though known for his work in jazz, Ali contributed to other experimental art forms, including multi-media performances with the Gift of Eagle Orchestra and Cosmic Legends, performances such as Devachan and the Monads, Dwarf of Oblivion, which took place at The Kitchen Center for Performance Art, and a tribute to John Cage in New York's Central Park. Other artists of the orchestra and Cosmic Legends have included Hayes Greenfield (sax), Perry Robinson (clarinet), Wayne Lopes (guitar), Dave Douglas (trumpeter), Gloria Tropp (vocals), Louise Landes Levi (sarangi)director/pianist Sylvie Degiez along with poets and actors Ira Cohen, Taylor Mead, and Judith Malina. Later life In the last years of his life, Ali led his own quintet. A double album entitled Judgment Day was recorded in February 2005 and features Jumaane Smith on trumpet, Lawrence Clark on tenor saxophone, Greg Murphy on piano, and Joris Teepe on bass. This album was recorded at Ali's own Survival Studio, which has been in existence since the 1970s. In addition to his performance activities Ali served as mentor to young drummers such as Matt Smith. In 2007, Ali recorded \\"Going to the Ritual\\" in duo with bassist/violinist Henry Grimes with a second duo recording in post-production at the time of Ali's death. Ali and Grimes also played five duo concerts together between 2007 and 2009 and a sixth concert in June 2007 with pianist Marilyn Crispell. Ali is the featured drummer on Azar Lawrence's album Mystic Journey, recorded in April 2009 and released in May 2010. Rashied Ali died at age 76 in a Manhattan hospital after suffering a heart attack. He is survived by wife Patricia and three children.

Music career Baron was born on June 26, 1955, in Richmond Virginia. When he was nine, he taught himself how to play the drums. As a teenager, he played in rock bands and dixieland jazz groups and was given his first gig opportunity at the age of 13 when pianist BJ Doyle's regular drummer took ill and she knew he was a keeper after just minutes. After high school, he spent a year at the Berklee College of Music. He moved to Los Angeles in the early 1970s and embarked on a professional career, playing with Carmen McRae and Al Jarreau. He worked as a freelance drummer and session musician with Chet Baker, Stan Getz, Dizzy Gillespie, and Hampton Hawes. In 1982 he moved to New York City and joined guitarist Bill Frisell, with whom he would play often throughout his career. He also played in groups with Red Rodney, Fred Hersch, Enrico Pieranunzi, and Marc Johnson. Starting in the late 1980s, he became a bigger part of the avant-garde jazz scene when he played regularly at the Knitting Factory, recorded with singer Laurie Anderson, and began a long association with John Zorn.

It is also the site of the highest tonnage port in Australia. Port Hedland has a natural deep anchorage harbour which, as well as being the main fuel and container receival point for the region, was seen as perfect for shipment of the iron ore being mined in the ranges located inland from the town. The ore is moved by railway from four major iron ore deposits to the east and south of the Port Hedland area. The port exported 519,408,000 tonnes of iron ore (2017‚Äì2018). Other major resource activities supported by the town include the offshore natural gas fields, salt, manganese, and livestock. Major deposits of lithium are being developed and exploited south of the town as well. Grazing of cattle and sheep was formerly a major revenue earner for the region, but this has slowly declined. Port Hedland was also formerly the terminus for the WAGR Marble Bar Railway, which serviced the gold mining area of Marble Bar from July 1911 until closure on 31 October 1951. The locomotive from the Port Hedland to Marble Bar rail service is now preserved at the Kalamunda Historical Village in the south of the state. Located between Port Hedland and South Hedland are the large salt hills of Dampier Salt, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto. These large mounds have almost become a tourist attraction in their own right.  History  Iron ore mines in the Pilbara region. Port Hedland is known by the Indigenous Kariyarra and Nyamal people as Marapikurrinya, which either means \\"place of good water\\" (as told by a Nyamal language speaker) and makes reference to the three reliable fresh water soaks that can still be seen in and around the town, or as the town council's website says \\"refers to the hand like formation of the tidal creeks coming off the harbour (marra - hand, pikurri - pointing straight and nya - a place name marker)\\". According to Dreamtime legend, there was a huge blind water snake living in the landlocked area of water known as Jalkawarrinya. This landlocked area is now the turning basin for the ships that enter the port and as the story goes, \\"the coming of the big ships meant it was unable to stay\\". The coastline in the area was seen by European mariners as early as 1628, when the Dutch merchant ship Vianen, captained by Gerrit Franszoon de Witt visited. Swedish-born mariner Peter Hedland was the first European to note the harbour's existence and the possibility of using it as a port. Peter Hedland arrived in the area in April 1863 on board his boat Mystery, which he had built himself at Point Walter on the banks of the Swan River. He named the harbour Mangrove Harbour and reported that it would make a good landing site with a well protected harbour, and that there was also fresh water available. However, the port was initially regarded as unusable, due to a sandbar that frequently sealed the entrance and thick mangroves round the shore; further, the narrow entrance made the harbour difficult to enter in bad weather. In 1866, the Government Resident at Roebourne, Robert John Sholl, directed Charles Wedge to re-examine Port Hedland as an alternative port, because the distance from Tien Tsin Harbour (later known as Cossack) was discouraging settlement in areas such as the De Grey River. Wedge encountered difficulties in his efforts, as he was hampered by heavy rain and the tidal creeks around Mangrove Harbour and was unable to reach the proposed port site to survey its suitability. In 1891, exploration of the area by Tom Traine, John Wedge (son of Charles Wedge) and Syd Hedley identified two landings and described the harbour as \\"pretty as well as safe\\". In September 1895, Cossack residents requested the District Surveyor survey the headland at Port Hedland in order to establish a town and requested that the Government build a jetty. In 1896, the Port Hedland town site was surveyed by government surveyor E.W. Geyer, who named the grid of streets after the pastoral pioneers, including Richardson, Withnell, Wedge and McKay streets, and in October 1896, the town site was gazetted. By 1905, the Roads Board had made considerable improvements to the roads and streets. By 1946, approximately 150 people lived in the area. The population of the town in 1968 was about 3,000 people.  Mining  Goldsworthy Mining developed an iron ore mine approximately 100 kilometres east of Port Hedland in the early 1960s and built the towns of Goldsworthy and later Shay Gap as mine sites. A rail line was then built to Port Hedland, where dredging was undertaken to deepen and widen the port's channel, and a wharf was built opposite the township of Port Hedland on Finucane Island. Shipment of ore began on 27 May 1966, when the Harvey S. Mudd sailed from Port Hedland to Japan with 24,900 tonnes of ore. In 1967, iron ore was discovered at Mount Whaleback, and a mining venture was undertaken that included the establishment of a new town, Newman, 426 km of rail from the mine to the port and the development of processing equipment at both Newman and Port Hedland. In 1986, at a cost of $87 million, the existing channel was dredged to allow larger ships to enter the port. Prior to dredging, the port was only able to load vessels of less than 2,000 tonnes, but today it is able to accommodate ships over 250,000 tonnes. In 2013, finance was being raised for yet another iron ore mine, railway and port, this time for the Roy Hill project. It requires a 344 km railway.http://www.railpage.com.au/f-p1883323.htm#1883323 With the neighbouring ports of Port Walcott and Dampier, Port Hedland is one of three major iron ore exporting ports in the Pilbara region.  1968 plane crash  On 31 December 1968, a Vickers Viscount operated by MacRobertson Miller Airlines crashed at nearby Indee Station. The plane had flown from Perth without incident until about 10 minutes before landing at Port Hedland. The aircraft suffered catastrophic failure of the spar in the right wing. The wing suddenly separated from the fuselage. All 26 on board, including both pilots and two flight attendants, were killed.  Immigration detention facility  In 1991, an immigration detention facility, the Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre, was opened to deal with the arrival of boat people seeking asylum. Port Hedland was seen as a good location, as it is in an area where many asylum seekers arriving by boat were entering Australia, and it had an international airport that would allow for easy deportations when required. The detention centre, situated on the beach front, was formerly a single-men's quarters for Mount Newman Mining Co. The centre was privatised by the first Howard Ministry in the late 1990s. It was closed in 2004 due to the falling number of asylum seekers arriving by boat in Australia's north- west. The town mayor called for the federal government to allow the town to use the detention centre to accommodate the many new mine workers needed for the town's mining boom. A lack of accommodation made it difficult for companies to operate efficiently, as they were unable to house staff or consultants within the town's small number of hotels. The centre is now operating as the Beachfront Village. West End In October 2019 the state government announced an Improvement Plan would be imposed over the West End of Port Hedland. The purpose of the plan was to prohibit all future residential development due to the health impacts caused by dust levels generated by Port activities.  Climate  Port Hedland has a semi arid climate with a tropical savanna climate influence. Port Hedland is warm to hot all year round, with mean maximum temperatures of in January and in July. Maximum temperatures in summer are usually moderated by a warm but humid sea breeze. Port Hedland is very sunny, averaging over 10 hours of sunshine per day annually and being in the sunniest region of Australia,http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/climate_averages/sunshine- hours/index.jsp receiving around 218.9 clear days annually. Dewpoint in the warmer months typically ranges from . Annual rainfall (falling almost exclusively between December and June) averages but because of erratic cyclones is subject to some of the largest variations in annual precipitation in the world. As an illustration, in 1942, fell, but in 1944 only fell and the town went for over 300 days with no rain. The town received record daily rainfall on 27 January 1967 when a total of of rainfall was recorded for 24 hours, which is more than the mean annual rainfall. The high summer temperatures experienced in Port Hedland mean that most tourists to the area choose to visit in the cooler months between May and September. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the Western Pilbara, including Port Hedland is the sunniest place in Australia; being the only place to record an annual average of more than 10 hours a day of sunshine.  Infrastructure   Harbour  Port Hedland's harbour is managed by the Pilbara Ports Authority, a state government instrumentality. The Port Authority's headquarters, control tower and heliport are at Mangrove Point, just to the west of The Esplanade at the western end of Port Hedland. The tugboat pen, customs office and public jetty are at nearby Laurentius Point. The harbour's wharves are located on both sides of the harbour: Finucane Island to the west and Port Hedland to the east. Access by oceangoing vessels into and out of the harbour is via a narrow curved channel. A tower, installed on 10 September 2012. The structure, which stands at some 60 m above ground level, has been coined Port Hedland's 'Tower of Dreams' and was constructed by Goodline. Education The area contains five primary schools (four government, one Catholic), along with Hedland Senior High School and the Port Hedland School of the Air.  Fauna and flora  Port Hedland has a flatback sea turtle rookery, located on the main beach front. Several lookouts along the beach front path allow views of marine mammals including Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphins and Australian snubfin dolphins. The Port Hedland Saltworks Important Bird Area is a 103 km2 tract of originally intertidal land, now containing a saltern, about 20 km east of the port of Port Hedland. The site regularly supports over 1% of the world populations of red-necked stints and sharp- tailed sandpipers, as well as a population of the range-restricted dusky gerygone. Species that have strongly declined since the 1980s are broad-billed sandpipers, Asian dowitchers, curlew sandpipers, red-necked avocets, banded stilts, Oriental plovers, Oriental pratincoles and white-winged black terns. Other species present include Australian bustards, bush stone-curlews, western bowerbirds, painted finches and canary white-eyes.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Port Hedland Saltworks. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 22 September 2011. Estuaries such as Pretty Pool support mangroves, marine fish, and birds.  Environmental issues  Pollution from iron ore dust regularly exceeds national standards. The local hospitalisation rate for respiratory infections is 30% higher than the Western Australian average.  Blackrock Stakes  The Blackrock Stakes is a 122 km race from Goldsworthy to Port Hedland in which competitors, either in teams or as individuals, push wheelbarrows weighed down with iron ore. It was first run in 1971, and competitors pushed a wheelbarrow full of iron ore from a remote mine site into Port Hedland. Since then the race has grown to raise than $1 million for charity as a modified version where teams of 10, trios, duos and lone runners now push modified wheelbarrows containing 11 kg of iron ore over the distance.ABC Blackrock States broadcast .

Since 2000, the group has released several records on Winter & Winter. The group Pachora, also including Black, Speed, and Sverrisson, and with Brad Shepik on tambura and electric saz, plays music that is similarly rhythmically diverse, but inspired by Balkan rhythms. Jim participated as drummer 12 in the Boredoms 77 Boadrum performance which occurred on July 7, 2007, at the Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park in Brooklyn, New York.

Hardt is best known for his book Empire, which was co-written with Antonio Negri. It has been praised by Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek as the \\"Communist Manifesto of the 21st Century\\".\\"Have Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri Rewritten the Communist Manifesto For the Twenty-First Century?. Lacan. Retrieved on 2015-04-03. Hardt and Negri suggest that several forces which they see as dominating contemporary life, such as class oppression, globalization and the commodification of services (or production of affects), have the potential to spark social change of unprecedented dimensions. A sequel, Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire was published in August 2004. It outlines an idea first propounded in Empire, which is that of the multitude as possible locus of a democratic movement of global proportions. The third and final part of the trilogy, Commonwealth, was published in 2009. Early life and education Hardt attended Winston Churchill High School in Potomac, Maryland. He studied engineering at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania from 1978 to 1983. In college during the 1970s energy crisis, he began to take an interest in alternative energy sources.Vulliamy, \\"Empire hits back\\" Talking about his college politics, he said, \\"I thought that doing alternative energy engineering for third world countries would be a way of doing politics that would get out of all this campus political posing that I hated.

Thought Hardt is concerned with the joy of political life, and has stated, \\"One has to expand the concept of love beyond the limits of the couple.\\"Michael Hardt. Identity and Difference. Lecture at European Graduate School. 2005 The politics of the multitude is not solely about controlling the means of productivity or liberating one's own subjectivity. These two are also linked to love and joy of political life and realizing political goals. Hardt does not consider teaching a revolutionary occupation, nor does he think the college is a particularly political institution. \\"But thinking of politics now as a project of social transformation on a large scale, I'm not at all convinced that political activity can come from the university.\\"Hardt, Smith, Minardi, \\"The Collaborator,\\" 71 Hardt says visions of a public education and equal and open access to the university are gradually disappearing: the \\"war on terror\\" has promoted only limited military and technological knowledges, while the required skills of the biopolitical economy, \\"the creation of ideas, images, code, affects, and other immaterial goods\\" are not yet recognized as the primary key to economic innovation. Many of Hardt's works have been co-written with Antonio Negri. Occupation movements of 2011‚Äì2012 In May 2012 Hardt and Negri self-published an electronic pamphlet on the occupation and encampment movements of 2011-2012 called Declaration that argues the movement explores new forms of democracy.

Biography Early years Brian Blade in Aarhus, Denmark 2017 Blade was born and raised in Shreveport, Louisiana. The first music he experienced was gospel and songs of praise at the Zion Baptist Church where his father, Brady L. Blade, Sr., has been the pastor for fifty-two years. In elementary school, music appreciation classes were an important part of his development and at age nine, he began playing the violin. Inspired by his older brother, Brady Blade, Jr., who had been the drummer at Zion Baptist Church, Brian shifted his focus to the drums throughout middle and high school. During high school, while studying with Dorsey Summerfield, Jr., Blade began listening to the music of John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Art Blakey, Thelonious Monk, Elvin Jones, and Joni Mitchell. By the age of eighteen, Brian moved to New Orleans to attend Loyola University. From 1988 through 1993, he studied and played with most of the master musicians living in New Orleans, including Johnny Vidacovich, Ellis Marsalis, Steve Masakowski, Bill Huntington, Mike Pellera, John Mahoney, George French, Germaine Bazzle, David Lee, Jr., Alvin Red Tyler, Tony Dagradi and Harold Battiste. The Fellowship Band and sideman work In 1997, Blade formed The Fellowship Band with pianist Jon Cowherd, bassist Chris Thomas, saxophonists Myron Walden and Melvin Butler, guitarist Jeff Parker, and pedal steel guitarist Dave Easley. The band released its debut album, Brian Blade Fellowship, in 1998, Perceptual (with guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel) in 2000, Season of Changes in 2008, Landmarks in 2014, and Body and Shadow in 2017. Reviewing the band's 2014 Landmarks album, John Kelman wrote: > As the Fellowship Band has grown, it has moved away from overt traditional > references, even though they're an undercurrent throughout. Instead, as it > explores milestones both inner and outer, Landmarks further speaks with the > singular voice that the Fellowship Band has built upon since inception. > Blending folkloric references, hints of church and spiritual concerns, jazz > modality and countrified touchstones, Landmarks is the perfect name for > Brian Blade & The Fellowship Band's fourth album; beyond its meaning to the > group, it truly is yet another landmark recording in the core quintet's > evolutionary travels. It may have come after a long gap in time, but that > only makes it a wait all the more worthwhile. While continuing to work with the Fellowship Band, since 2000 Blade has also been a member of Wayne Shorter's quartet. He has also recorded with Daniel Lanois, Joni Mitchell, Ellis Marsalis, Marianne Faithfull, Emmylou Harris, Billy Childs, Herbie Hancock, and Bob Dylan. Singer-songwriter work In 2009, Blade released Mama Rosa, his first album as a singer-songwriter, with songs dedicated to his grandmother and family. The album featured Daniel Lanois, vocalists Kelly Jones and Daryl Johnson, bassist Chris Thomas, guitarists Kurt Rosenwinkel and Geoffrey Moore, pedal steel guitarists Greg Leisz and Patrick Smith, and pianists Aaron Embry and Jon Cowherd. It was co- produced by Brian Blade and Adam Samuels. The live band includes Steven Nistor on drums. On April 30, 2016, Blade played at the White House in Washington, D.C., as part of The International Jazz Day Global Concert.  Honors  *2013: ECHO Jazz Award \\"International Artist of the Year Drums/Percussion\\", for Quiver. Equipment Blade uses vintage Gretsch, Ludwig, Sonor and Slingerland drums. He plays Canopus drums when touring in Japan. He has used a variety of cymbals over the years, including multiple ride cymbals made from Roberto Spizzichino, vintage A Zildjians, and often a 22\\" Zildjian K Constantinople Light Ride (discontinued model). His acoustic guitar is a mid-1950s Gibson LG-3.

The publication focuses on fashion, style, and culture for men, though articles on food, movies, fitness, sex, music, travel, sports, technology, and books are also featured.  History  Gentlemen's Quarterly was launched in 1931 in the United States as Apparel Arts. It was a men's fashion magazine for the clothing trade, aimed primarily at wholesale buyers and retail sellers. Initially it had a very limited print run and was aimed solely at industry insiders to enable them to give advice to their customers. The popularity of the magazine among retail customers, who often took the magazine from the retailers, spurred the creation of Esquire magazine in 1933. Apparel Arts continued until 1957 when it was transformed into a quarterly magazine for men, which was published for many years by Esquire Inc. Apparel was dropped from the logo in 1958 with the spring issue after nine issues, and the name Gentlemen's Quarterly was established. Gentlemen's Quarterly was re-branded as GQ in 1967. The rate of publication was increased from quarterly to monthly in 1970. In 1979 Cond√© Nast bought the publication, and editor Art Cooper changed the course of the magazine, introducing articles beyond fashion and establishing GQ as a general men's magazine in competition with Esquire. Subsequently, international editions were launched as regional adaptations of the U.S. editorial formula. Jim Nelson was named editor-in-chief of GQ in February 2003; during his tenure, he worked as both a writer and an editor of several National Magazine Award-nominated pieces, and the magazine became more oriented towards younger readers and those who prefer a more casual style. Nonnie Moore was hired by GQ as fashion editor in 1984, having served in the same position at Mademoiselle and Harper's Bazaar. Jim Moore, the magazine's fashion director at the time of her death in 2009, described the choice as unusual, observing that \\"She was not from men's wear, so people said she was an odd choice, but she was actually the perfect choice\\". Jim Moore also noted that she changed the publication's more casual look: \\"She helped dress up the pages, as well as dress up the men, while making the mix more exciting and varied and approachable for men.\\" GQ has been closely associated with metrosexuality. The writer Mark Simpson coined the term in an article for British newspaper The Independent about his visit to a GQ exhibition in London: \\"The promotion of metrosexuality was left to the men's style press, magazines such as The Face, GQ, Esquire, Arena and FHM, the new media which took off in the Eighties and is still growing ... They filled their magazines with images of narcissistic young men sporting fashionable clothes and accessories. And they persuaded other young men to study them with a mixture of envy and desire.\\" The magazine has expanded its coverage beyond lifestyle issues. For example, in 2003, journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely wrote an eight-page feature story in GQ on famous con man Steve Comisar. GQ has been called the \\"holy text of woke capital, according to The Spectator. In 2016, GQ launched the spinoff quarterly GQ Style. In 2018, writing for GQ, Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for her article about Dylann Roof, who had shot nine Afro-Americans in a church in Charleston.Pulitzer-Preis f√ºr Weinstein-Enth√ºllungen orf.at, April 16, 2018, retrieved April 17, 2018. (German)  Men of the Year  GQ (U.S.) first named their Men of the Year in 1996, featuring the award recipients in a special issue of the magazine. British GQ launched its annual Men of the Year awards in 2009 and GQ India launched its version the following year.

The sexualization of the actresses in the photos caused controversy among parents of teens who watch the show Glee. The Parents Television Council was the first to react to the photo spread when it was leaked prior to GQ's planned publishing date. Their President Tim Winter stated, \\"By authorizing this kind of near-pornographic display, the creators of the program have established their intentions on the show's directions. And it isn't good for families\\". The photoshoot was published as planned and Dianna Agron went on to state that the photos that were taken did not represent who she is and that she was sorry if anyone was offended by them.  Russian apartment bombings  GQs September 2009 U.S. magazine published, in its \\"backstory\\" section, an article by Scott Anderson, \\"None Dare Call It Conspiracy\\". Before GQ published the article, an internal email from a Cond√© Nast lawyer referred to it as \\"Vladimir Putin's Dark Rise to Power\\". The article reported Anderson's investigation of the 1999 Russian apartment bombings, and included interviews with Mikhail Trepashkin who investigated the bombings while he was a colonel in Russia's Federal Security Service. The story, including Trepashkin's own findings, contradicted the Russian Government's official explanation of the bombings and criticized Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia. Cond√© Nast's management tried to keep the story out of Russia. It ordered executives and editors not to distribute that issue in Russia or show it to \\"Russian government officials, journalists or advertisers\\". Management decided not to publish the story on GQs website or in Cond√© Nast's foreign magazines, not to publicize the story, and asked Anderson not to syndicate the story \\"to any publications that appear in Russia\\". Within 24 hours of the magazine's publication in the U.S., bloggers published the original English text and a translation into Russian on the Web.  Criticism of the Bible and Western literary canon  On April 19, 2018, the editors of GQ published an article titled \\"21 Books You Don't Have to Read\\" in which the editors compiled a list of works they think are overrated and should be passed over, including Catcher in the Rye, The Alchemist, Blood Meridian, A Farewell to Arms, The Old Man and the Sea, The Lord of the Rings, and Catch-22. GQ's review included a criticism of the Bible, calling it \\"repetitive, self- contradictory, sententious, foolish, and even at times ill-intentioned\\". The article generated a backlash among Internet commentators.  Circulation  The magazine reported an average worldwide paid circulation of 934,000 in the first half of 2019, down 1.1% from 944,549 in 2016 and 2.6% from 958,926 in 2015.

He is introduced in chapter #113 , first published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine on February 24, 1987, entering the martial arts tournament to kill Son Goku and his fellow-students. However, he later teams up with them to defeat Piccolo Daima≈ç, accompanied by his friend Chaozu. Tien becomes Goku's rival for a period and is notable for being the first person in the series to fly using and to use the technique. The character of Tien has received praise from reviewers of manga and anime. They praised his quest for redemption in the Piccolo arc and his fights have been celebrated as dramatic, intense, and entertaining. Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released bearing his likeness including action figures, key chains, and capsule toys. Design The character's is named after tenshindon, a ch≈´ka dish consisting of a crabmeat omelet over rice. Toriyama said that although Tien is strong and cool, he based his name on a well-known Chinese food just to be \\"silly.\\" Tien is loosely based on Erlang Shen from Journey to the West, a three-eyed taoist deity who first appears as an adversary of Sun Wukong, later becoming his ally and rival. Voice actors Tien is voiced by Hirotaka Suzuoki in most media, with the exception of episodes 82 and 84 of Dragon Ball Z, where he is voiced by K≈çichi Yamadera. Suzuoki said that despite joining the cast while the show had already been in production for a while, it was easy for him to relax and find his place. After Suzuoki's death in 2006, Mitsuaki Madono voiced Tien in several video games such as Burst Limit and World's Greatest Adventure, before Hikaru Midorikawa took over the role for Dragon Ball Kai and all media since. In the Funimation dub of the series, Tien is voiced by Chris Cason and John Burgmeier.https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=9199 Appearances In Dragon Ball Tien is introduced as the star pupil of Kame-Sen'nin's rival, , who has him and Chaozu enter the Tenka'ichi Bud≈çkai to prove his students' superiority. He begins as an arrogant, but talented martial artist, antagonizing Goku, Krillin, and especially Yamcha.Dragon Ball, volume 10, chapter 113 ‚Äî He first fights Yamcha in the tournament, whose leg he ruthlessly breaks to win. Upon learning that Goku killed Taopaipai, the younger brother of Tsuru-Sen'nin and a mentor of Tien's, he decides to kill Goku in revenge. He fights Kame-Sen'nin (disguised as Jackie Chun) in his next match, and Kame-Sen'nin shakes his resolve to kill Goku. In the final fight, he battles Goku and brutally beats him down early in the fight, before Goku uses his full power, making the fight more even. Chaozu interferes with the fight by using his psychic powers to paralyze Goku without Tien's knowledge or consent, but once Tien realizes that Chaozu is cheating, he defies his master and refuses to kill Goku.Dragon Ball manga, volume 11, chapter 132 Tien wins the Tournament after destroying the stage with the powerful but potentially life-threatening Kik≈çh≈ç, and after abandons Tsuru-Sen'nin with Chaozu. Launch falls in love with him and asks him to live at Kame House with her and Roshi, but Tien refuses, saying that he doesn't want to live with the rival of his former master. After the death of Krillin at the hands of Piccolo Daima≈ç, Tien and Chaozu offer to help Kame-Sen'nin in the search for the Dragon Balls. But when Chaozu and Kame-Sen'nin are both killed and Piccolo wishes for his youth, he learns the suicidal Mafuba technique in order to seal away Piccolo Daima≈ç.Dragon Ball manga, volume 13, chapter 153 After Piccolo chooses to attack West City, Tien intercepts him despite knowing that he can't be revived by the Dragon Balls, but must defeat Piccolo's strongest son Drum first, having to be rescued by Goku.

He saves Android 18 and Android 16 from being absorbed by Cell and gives them time to escape by continuously attacking Cell (who had just easily defeated Piccolo and Android 16), expending all his energy and having to be rescued by Goku.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 15, chapter 179 He then participates in the battle against the Cell Jr.s.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 18, chapter 214 When Goku returns from the afterlife and asks where Tien is, Krillin says that he is not coming.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 20, chapter 236 However, after Majin Boo is released, Tien appears and saves, Gohan, Dende, and Mr. Satan from being killed by Boo. He fights Boo, but is unable to damage him, and is defeated by a single kick. He and Chaozu later contributed their energy for Goku's Genki Dama attack to defeat Boo once and for all. In a filler episode of Dragon Ball Z, during the Saiyan arc, Tien trains for the Saiyans by fighting members of their race in the past using the Pendulum Room. In Dragon Ball Super Goku decides to recruit both Tien and Master Roshi for the Tournament of Power team for Universe 7, and learns that they have formed a martial arts dojo. Tien initially turns down Goku's request and works with Goku, Chaozu, and Master Roshi to reverse the brainwashing of his students by Yurin, a woman that Tien used to be classmates with during his time at Crane School who had sworn revenge on him after he left and declined fighting her. After Yurin brainwashes Master Roshi, the latter defeats Tien, who agrees to join the Tournament of Power as he believes the ten million Zeni promised by Goku will help repair the village. Tien agrees to participate in a fight against Gohan and Piccolo with Goku, calling off the match after Piccolo destroys the mountain fighting stage. Tien is part of the group that adheres to Gohan's plan of remaining together and later fights Universe 2's Harmira, using his multi-form technique to give himself time against Harmira. Three of Tien's four clones are defeated by Harmira, who shoots the ground from underneath Tien to knock him off stage and is grabbed by Tien's three other clones, eliminating them both from the tournament. In Toriyama's films and Dragon Ball Super Tien appears in four Dragon Ball Z movies; in the third, Tien battles the henchmen of Turles;Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might in the ninth, Tien is involved with an intergalactic tournament and helps Gohan with Bojack's minions;Dragon Ball Z: Bojack Unbound in the fourteenth, Tien, Android 18 and Piccolo attack Beerus after Buu angers him, the three being defeated;Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods and in the fifteenth, Tien assists in the battle against the resurrected Freeza and his henchmen, being saved from death by Whis.Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' The events of Battle of Gods and Resurrection 'F have been adapted as the first two story arcs for the Dragon Age Super anime, with Tien's role in the Super retelling of the story arcs relatively unchanged. In other media Tien makes very brief appearances in Dragon Ball GT, the anime-only sequel to the series. Tien appears in most Dragon Ball games. In the 2003 game Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2, Tien and Yamcha can be absorbed by Majin Buu to create a form exclusive to the game. In the 2009 game Dragon Ball: Raging Blast, Chaozu is told by Butter and Juice that he drags Tien down, the latter arriving during Chaozu's fight with the pair and defeating them both, Tien afterward asserting that the duo's claim was false. The two are subsequently challenged by Goten and Trunks, who fuse into Gotenks, and Goku and Vegeta, defeating both pairs to assert themselves as the best tag team. In the 2018 game Dragon Ball FighterZ, Tien is guarded by Chaozu while the two are approached by clones until Goku and Krillin arrive. After Krillin explains the situation, Tien states his intent to fight alongside them against the clones and agrees to Chaozu's help on the condition that he does not leave his side. After Android 21 follows the heroes to the Kai≈ç-shin planet, Tien uses the Neo Tri-Beam to aid in destroying her. He is referenced by American rapper Soulja Boy in the uncut version of his song \\"Goku\\", where he states that he \\"feels like Tien\\" along with other Dragon Ball characters and Pikachu. Reception Tien is a popular character in the series, in 2004 fans of the series voted him the sixteenth most popular character for the book Dragon Ball Forever. Tien's voice actor for the original broadcast, Hirotaka Suzuoki, said despite the character not being an ordinary human, the character's interactions with Chaozu showed his humanity. Tien has received both praise and criticism from numerous publications. Theron Martin of Anime News Network stated that it was 'fun' seeing the groundwork for Tien being laid and reflecting on how he later changed. Martin went on to say that Goku's fight with Tien \\"presents the most dramatic and intense duel to date in the series.\\" Davey C. Jones of Active Anime noted that \\"Tien's redemption made an interesting side story\\" and that it was \\"crucial in the final episodes\\" of Piccolo Daima≈ç arc. Chris Beveridge of Mania Entertainment commented on episodes 62-92 of Dragon Ball, saying, \\"there are some dull moments to be had, especially as I don't find Tien or Chaozu to be interesting characters.\\" However he went on to say that Tien's fight with Goku \\"was really quite good\\" and expressed mixed feelings about the character, saying that as a villain \\"he was fairly one dimensional.\\" But after being influenced by Kame- Sen'nin's teachings Beveridge said, he \\"becomes a much more interesting character\\" and was disappointed that he did not have a really \\"strong story told for him after this series.\\" Sean Connolly of the same site said that Tien \\"shows his worth\\" by holding off Cell \\"with a flurry of high powered attacks.\\" ANN's D.F. Smith said that Tien's fight against Piccolo Daima≈ç's minions was entertaining, but the conclusion of his fight against Goku was random.

The indigenous Innu called the place Totouskak (plural for totouswk or totochak) meaning \\"bosom\\", probably in reference to the two round and sandy hills located on the west side of the village. According to other interpretations, it could also mean \\"place of lobsters\\", or \\"place where the ice is broken\\" (from the Innu shashuko). Although located in Innu territory, the post was also frequented by the Mi'kmaq people in the second half of the 16th century, who called it Gtatosag (\\"among the rocks\\"). Alternate spellings of Tadoussac over the centuries included Tadousac (17th and 18th centuries), Tadoussak, and Thadoyzeau (1550). Tadoussac was first visited by Europeans in 1535 and was established in 1599 when the first trading post in Canada was formed there, in addition to a permanent settlement being placed in the same area that the Grand Hotel is located today. History Tadoussac in about 1612, illustrated by Samuel de Champlain Tadoussac, 1900 Jacques Cartier came to the site in 1535 during his second voyage. He found Innu people using it as a base for hunting seal. Later that same century, Basques conducted whaling expeditions on the river, as well as engaging in hides trade with the natives based in the shore at the mouth of the Sagueney. Tadoussac was founded in 1599 by Fran√ßois Grav√© Du Pont, a merchant, and Pierre de Chauvin de Tonnetuit, a captain of the French Royal Navy, when they acquired a fur trade monopoly from King Henry IV. Grav√© and Chauvin built the settlement on the shore at the mouth of the Saguenay River, at its confluence with the St. Lawrence, to profit from its location. But the frontier was harsh and only sixteen of the initial 50 settlers survived the first winter. In 1603, the tabagie or \\"feast\\" of Tadoussac reunited Grav√© with Samuel de Champlain and with the Montagnais, the Algonquins, and the Etchimins.\\" In 1615, the Mission of L'Exaltation-de-la-Sainte-Croix-de- Tadoussac, named in memory of a cross planted by Jean de Quen, was founded by the R√©collet Order. Their missionary brothers sang the first Mass there two years later. Tadoussac remained the only seaport on the St. Lawrence River for 30 years. Historians believe the St. Lawrence Iroquoians, who inhabited the St. Lawrence valley upriver to the west, were defeated and pushed out by the Mohawk before the early 17th century. By the late 17th and early 18th century, Tadoussac was the centre of fur trade between the French and First Nations peoples. Competition over the fur trade increased among the nations. Colonists from the Tadoussac area were involved in whaling from 1632 until at least the end of the century. In the 19th century, with industrialization reaching other parts of Canada, tourists discovered the appeal of this rural village. Wealthy Qu√©b√©cois built a number of vacation villas. A Victorian hotel called the Hotel Tadoussac was built in 1864; it was expanded around 1900 and demolished in 1942, and replaced by a newer Hotel Tadoussac. In 1855, the geographic township of Tadoussac was established. In 1899, it was incorporated as a village municipality. In 1937, the Parish Municipality of Tadoussac was formed, but dissolved in 1949 because it had less than 500 inhabitants. Present day Tadoussac as seen from the St. Lawrence The modern village of Tadoussac lies close to the site of the original settlement at the mouth of the Saguenay River. It is known as a tourist destination because of the rugged beauty of the Saguenay fjord and its facilities for whale watching. The authority for the Port of Tadoussac was transferred in April 2012 to the Municipality of Tadoussac.tc.gc.ca: \\"Transport Canada - Deproclamation Notice Subsection 2(1)\\" The entire area is either rural or still in a wilderness state, with several federal and provincial natural parks and preserves protecting natural resources. Tadoussac encompasses the first marine national park of Canada. The nearest urban agglomeration is Saguenay about west. Representation in other media *The film The Hotel New Hampshire, based on the 1981 John Irving novel of the same name, was shot at the Hotel Tadoussac and released in 1984. Geography Old chapel, built 1747-1750 Tadoussac is located on the north-west shore of the Saint Lawrence River, at its confluence with the Saguenay River. The cold, fresh water from the Saguenay and the warmer, salty water of the St. Lawrence, meet to create a rich marine environment. The rivers support an abundance of krill, making the area very attractive to whales. Transportation Tadoussac is the north-east terminus of the Baie-Ste-Catherine/Tadoussac ferry, which offers free and frequent service across the Saguenay River. The ferry is part of Quebec Route 138 and the main link to Sept-√éles. The village is considered the gateway to the Manicouagan region. Bus service to and from Quebec City and Montreal is offered by Intercar, twice a day, 7 days a week.bonjourquebec.com: \\"Intercar (Montr√©al - Qu√©bec - Charlevoix - C√¥te-Nord)\\" Tourism and attractions * Old chapel * Trading post of Pierre Chauvin * CIMM (Centre d'interpr√©tation des mammif√®res marins), Center of Marine Mammal Interpretation * Whale watching excursions in the Saguenay‚ÄìSt. Lawrence Marine Park *Club de Golf Tadoussac Demographics Painting of Tadoussac by Charles Comfort, including the Old Chapel (1935) Population trend:Statistics Canada: 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011 census * population in 2016: 799 {2011 to 2016 population change: -1.7%} * Population in 2011: 813 (2006 to 2011 population change: -4.4%) * Population in 2006: 850 {2001 to 2006 population change:-2.2%} * Population in 2001: 870 {1996 to 2001 population change:-4.7%} * Population in 1996: 913 {1991 to 1996 population change:8.8%} * Population in 1991: 832 Private dwellings occupied by usual residents: 380 (total dwellings: 400) Mother tongue: * English as first language: 1.8% * French as first language: 92.3% * English and French as first language: 1.8% * Other as first language: 4.1% Gallery Image:Tadoussac - QC - Hotel Tadoussac2.jpgHotel Tadoussac Image:Poste de traite Tadoussac.jpgReconstructed trading post in Tadoussac Image:Whale watching Tadoussac 11.jpgWhale watching excursion See also * List of village municipalities in Quebec * 1925 Charlevoix‚ÄìKamouraska earthquake  References  External links * Tadoussac website * The CIMM in Tadoussac Category:Villages in Quebec Category:Incorporated places in C√¥te-Nord Category:Hudson's Bay Company trading posts Category:New France Category:Populated places established in 1599 Category:16th century in Quebec Category:La Haute-C√¥te-Nord Regional County Municipality ","title":"Tadoussac"},{"id":"558984","text":"Wick () is a small village and community in the Vale of Glamorgan in Wales, situated approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from the coast. The closest towns are Llantwit Major, Cowbridge and Bridgend. The community includes Broughton.  Amenities  The village has two pubs, a village shop and a primary school. There are several footpaths and bridleways linking Wick with the surrounding countryside and the village is popular with cyclists. Walks from Wick include those to the local beaches, Traeth Bach and Traeth Mawr, via the Cwm Nash footpath at Monknash or from Dunraven Bay at Southerndown. The cliffs here form part of the Glamorgan Heritage Coast.  History  Archaeological evidence (such as the earthworks associated with burial mounds, settlements and enclosures) suggests that there was settlement in Wick from around 1600BC when a small proto-Celtic community may have developed, probably farming the surrounding land on a subsistence basis. The site of an ancient beacon tower lies just north-west of the village and to the south-west, on the cliff edge at Whitmore Stairs, is the earthworks of an Iron Age univallate hillfort, part of an ancient monument known as the Cwm Bach Camps. It is thought probable that the larger of the forts that make up this monument, situated approximately away on the Trwyn y Witch (Witches Point) headland, was at one time occupied by Caratacus (who led the Silures in resistance to the Roman occupation). Given its proximity to Tusker Rock, a small island named after Tuska (a Danish Viking), it is likely that Wick was a focus for Viking attacks on the south Wales coast. Local folklore suggests that beacons were lit on high ground around the village to warn of such raids and that attacks were fiercely resisted. It is thought that the village eventually came under Norman control in around 1097AD. Scheduled ancient monuments in Wick include Buarth Mawr (comprising a barn) and Rhyle round barrow. Various archaeological finds have been made in Wick, including the discovery of a hoard of five Late Bronze Age socketed axes by Mr. Adrian Jones in 2005. In later times it is likely that Wick formed part of a medieval drovers route, by-passing the toll road through nearby Cowbridge. A Topographical Dictionary of The Dominion of Wales by Nicholas Carlisle, published 1811, recorded that in 1801 the population of Wick was 259. From 1822 parts of the village and areas of the surrounding land became part of the Dunraven Estate under the 1st Earl of Dunraven. By 1833 the population had risen to 349 according to A Topographical Dictionary of Wales by Samuel Lewis, published 1833, and in 1861 the population had reached 432 according to the 1880 Slaters Commercial Directory. This then decreased to 384 by 1871 (according to the same source) and decreased further to 327 by the time of the 1891 census (the current population is 694 according to the 2001 census). The Slaters Commercial Directory also recorded that there were once 6 public houses in the village (The Carpenter Arms, The Lamb and Flag, The Royal Oak, The Star, The Steady Pointer and The Swan) of which only The Lamb and Flag and The Star remain as public houses today. There are some interesting historical features in the village, the most obvious being the windmill tower, 'Melin Du', built in 1825, and the single storey remnants of a much earlier stone windmill, 'Wick Old Windmill', near to the school. At nearby Broughton there are former brewery malthouses, used from the 1930s to the 1960s by the Quakers as holiday accommodation for children and the elderly, now converted into private flats. Some of the buildings in the village are known to be several hundred years old and 34 are now listed as 'County Treasures'. The coastline to the south and west of Wick is formed of rocks of the Lower Lias series that display horizontal stratification and are fossil bearing. It is from the top of these cliffs that, according to local folklore, the 'Wreckers of Wick' would, in the times before modern navigation, lure ships onto the rocks by showing false lights and then plunder the cargo. It is recorded that the bodies of drowned sailors were recovered from the beaches by Monks from the monastic grange at nearby Monknash and taken to what is now the Plough & Harrow Inn where they were prepared for burial. Historically this stretch of coastline has one of the highest instances of shipwrecks in Wales, its exposure to the Atlantic swell, south-westerly winds, shallow reefs and the Nash sands bar making it treacherous to shipping. Recorded wrecks on the 5 km stretch of coastline between Trwyn y Witch and Nash Point include: the Royal Hunter (1747), the Indian Prince (1752), the Elizabeth (1753), the Prince (1764), the George (1770), the Industry (1786), the Thomas (1806), the Bee (1820), the Harriet (1827), the Jessie Orasie (1831), the Frolic (1831), the Providence (1832), the Mayflower (1841), the New Felicity (1841), the Vigo (1842), the Betsey (1849), the Lucie (1854), the Williams (1854), the Mary & Deffus (1861), the Gillies (1862), the Elphis (1865), the Amelie (1870), the New Dominian (1872), the Bessie (1872), the John & Eliza (1876), the Jane & Susan (1882), the Ben-y-gloe (1886), the Malleny (1886), the Caterina Camogle (1887), the Denbigh (1888), the Tilburnia (1888), the Claymore (1892), the Lizzie (1892), the Elizabeth Couch (1913), the Narcissus (1916), the Pollensa (1919) and the Cato (1951). The parish church of Wick is dedicated to Saint James the Great, and like many of the other churches in the parish dates from the twelfth century. It began as a chapel, but was later gifted to Ewenny Priory. It is a Grade 2* listed building and consists of a chancel, nave, south porch and western 'saddle back' tower. The church is built in the Early English Period style, although the oldest parts of the structure such as the chancel arch, the south door and a small window in the chancel, all date from the 12th century. The church has a medieval stone mensa (rectangular) altar, views of which are provided through the 'squints' (hagioscopes) from the nave. The altar has unusual niches on either side, which probably contained statues of St James and the Blessed Virgin in centuries past. St James' was the subject of a major Victorian restoration 125 years ago and further additions have been made since then. The registers date from 1813. Wick also has a Unitarian and General Baptist Chapel that has held regular services since 1792. Approximately to the west of the village is Monks Wood, a plantation of mixed native woodland species managed by the Woodland Trust and the Monks Wood Committee. The wood was planted with native broadleaved trees and shrubs by villagers from Wick in November 2000. A wide mown path follows a circular route through the site and there is an information display for visitors. Another area of ecological importance is Clemenstone Meadows, directly to the north of the village, comprising 2 traditionally managed meadows on either side of a brook that support a number of rare plant species. The village was the birthplace of Sir Keith Thomas in 1933 and is currently home to the family of the Olympic gold medallist and World Champion cyclist Nicole Cooke. Sports clubs in the village include Wick Rugby union Club and the Wick & District Cricket Club. On 28 November 2006 the village of Wick became the first community in the UK to be switched over to British Telecom's \\"21st Century Network\\" (21CN); an advanced high-speed broadband network that will be rolled out throughout the UK over the coming years, replacing all of BT's existing networks. Laura Wess, 11, made the first call using the system from Wick and Marcross Primary School to the Right Reverend John Stewart Davies, bishop of St Asaph, in North Wales. The village won the South Wales Region Award for the 2008 Calor Village of the Year.

It was designed this way in order to cut two or more smaller pieces ( in length) of firewood in rapid succession. A sawbuck should be heavy enough to negate any kickback from the saw while cutting. Building a sawbuck that is too light could result in injury as it may tip over while cutting, especially with a chainsaw. In Canada and Britain, and the United States, a sawbuck is called a sawhorse, although this term also refers to a similar device used (often in pairs) to support wood planks.  $10  \\"Sawbuck\\" is also a slang term for a U.S. $10 bill, derived from the similarity between the shape of a sawbuck device and the Roman numeral X (10), which formerly appeared on $10 bills. A \\"double sawbuck\\" is a twenty dollar bill.

Stulginskis was also acting President of Lithuania for a few hours later in 1926, following a military coup that was led by his predecessor, President Antanas Smetona, and which had brought down Stulginskis's successor, Kazys Grinius. The coup returned Smetona to office after Stulginskis's brief formal assumption of the Presidency. He began his theological studies in Kaunas and continued in Innsbruck, Austria. However, he decided not to become a priest and moved to the Institute of Agricultural Sciences in University of Halle. He graduated in 1913 and returned to Lithuania. There he started to work as a farmer. He published many articles on agronomy in Lithuanian press. In 1918 he started to publish journals ≈™kininkas (\\"Farmer\\") and ≈™kininko kalendorius (\\"Farmer's Calendar\\"). During World War I he moved to Vilnius. He was one of the founders of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party and the head of its Central Committee in 1917. He signed the memorandum for the president Woodrow Wilson, addressing the question of the recognition of the Lithuanian statehood by the United States. Contrary to Smetona's views, Stulginskis was oriented towards the Entente. He was one of co-organizers of the Vilnius Conference. After, he was elected to the Council of Lithuania. On February 16, 1918, he signed the Act of Independence of Lithuania. He was an advocate of the democratic republic as the form of the Lithuanian state. Thus, he strongly opposed the idea of monarchy (actually, Mindaugas II was the King of Lithuania from 11 July to 2 November 1918). In independent Lithuania Stulginskis was in charge of organizing the national army to defend the country against the aggressions of Bolsheviks and Poles. Many times served as a minister, May 1920 ‚Äì 1922 he was Speaker of the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania and thus acting president of the republic. 1922-1926 he was the second President of Lithuania. Stulginskis was Speaker of the Seimas 1926-1927. He withdrew from politics in 1927, and worked on his farm. In 1941 Stulginskis and his wife were arrested by the Soviet NKVD and deported to a gulag in the Krasnoyarsk region, while his wife was deported to the Komi area. After World War II in 1952 he was officially sentenced by the Soviet authorities to 25 years in prison for his anti- socialist and clerical policies in pre-war Lithuania. Released after Joseph Stalin's death in 1956, he was allowed to emigrate, yet he refused and returned to Lithuanian SSR. Stulginskis settled in Kaunas, where he died on September 22, 1969, aged 84, the last of the Signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania. Aleksandras Stulginskis in a Lithuanian poster.

Its headquarters are in Chaoyang District, Beijing. As of 2019, it is China's biggest state-run conglomerate with one of the largest pools of foreign assets in the world. Businesses Its initial aim was to \\"attract and utilize foreign capital, introduce advanced technologies, and adopt advanced and scientific international practice in operation and management.\\" It now owns 44 subsidiaries including China CITIC Bank, CITIC Limited, CITIC Trust and CITIC Merchant (mainly banks) in China, Hong Kong, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. History CITIC Group was founded as the China International Trust Investment Corporation (; abb. CITIC), a Chinese state-owned enterprise in 1979. In the 1980s, Chinese government founded many for profit corporations, which CITIC was under the leadership of Rong Yiren, a former businessman and politician at that time, who chose to stay in the Mainland China in the 1950s after his family business was nationalized. His son, Larry Yung,Yung was another transliteration of the same surname: . was the former chairman of CITIC Group's listed subsidiary CITIC Pacific. Larry also led the Hong Kong office and parent company of CITIC Pacific since 1986; Larry became a Hong Kong-based businessman since 1978. CITIC Group headquarters was based in Beijing; Hong Kong office was formally opened in 1985. The Mainland-based CITIC Bank was founded by the group in 1984. The group also acquired 12.5% stake of the Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific in 1987, and became a member of a shareholders' agreement in 2006; the stake was sold to fellow state-owned company Air China in 2009. The group also acquired Hong Kong-based Ka Wah Bank in 1986. In 1990, the group also absorbed some of the subsidiaries of another state-owned company, . Other notable acquisitions included 38.3% stake of another airline Dragonair, 20% stake of Hong Kong Telecom, etc. CITIC also acquired a Hong Kong listed company and renamed to CITIC Pacific in the 1990s. Part of the assets of the group were injected into the listed company as reverse IPO, including the stake of aforementioned Cathay Pacific. A full reverse IPO was took place in 2014. 2000s Its subsidiary, CITIC Pacific (, now known as CITIC Limited), made unauthorized bets on the foreign currency market in October 2008 and lost HK$14.7 billion (US$1.9 billion, when accounted for in mark-to-market terms). Senior executives such as Financial Controller Chau Chi-Yin and Group Finance Director Leslie Chang resigned. Its stock price plunged 55.1 percent upon the resumption of trade. CITIC Group injected most of their assets to CITIC Limited in 2014. However, CITIC Guoan Group was excluded, which was recapitalized by other private capital. In 2015, CITIC Group sold 10% stake of CITIC Limited to a joint-venture of Itochu and Charoen Pokphand for HK$34.4 billion (US$4.54 billion); the joint venture also subscribed new convertible preferred shares for HK$45.9 billion (or US$5.9 billion). It was reported it was the largest investment ever made by a Japanese general trading company. The transaction is also the largest acquisition in China by a Japanese company, and the largest investment by foreigners in a Chinese state-owned enterprise. In 2016, CITIC Group ranked 156th among the Fortune Global 500, with an annual revenue of $55,938 million.

He was the author of From Womb to Tomb: The Quality of Life of a South-East Asian, which to date remains one of the most influential writings about social security in Thailand. Born to a Thai Chinese family, Puey was a graduate of the first class of Thammasat University, teaching as a lecturer of French until winning a scholarship to study economics at the London School of Economics in 1938. His studies were interrupted by the Second World War, when he joined the Free Thai resistance movement opposed to the pro-Japanese military regime of Plaek Phibunsongkhram. He was captured as a prisoner of war in 1944 after parachuting into Chai Nat Province on a reconnaissance mission. Puey completed his studies after the war, receiving a doctorate in 1948. He joined the Ministry of Finance in 1949, serving in a progression of senior posts before becoming central bank governor in 1959. At 43, and serving for over 12 years, until 1971, Puey is to date both the youngest person appointed as, and the longest serving, Governor of the Bank of Thailand. As governor, he played a central role in shaping Thailand's economic development policies during the governments of Field Marshals Sarit Dhanarajata and Thanom Kittikachorn. He also was a proponent of financial co- operation in Southeast Asia, leading to the establishment of regional financial and institutions such as SEACAN. He was awarded the Magsaysay Award in the field of government service in 1965. An active academic, Puey was simultaneously Dean of the Faculty of Economics of Thammasat University from 1964 to 1972. In 1975 he was appointed Rector of Thammasat University, but resigned in protest following the massacre of student protesters on 6 October 1976. Tarred by nationalists as a leftist subversive, he was subsequently forced to flee the country for fear of his is safety, residing in the United Kingdom until his death in 1999. Early life and education Puey was born the fourth child of an immigrant Chinese fishmonger and a second generation Thai Chinese mother, with ancestry from Raoping. In 1934 he was among the first group of students to enrol at the newly opened Thammasat University, from which he graduated in 1937. After having briefly worked as a translator, Puey earned a government scholarship to study economics at the London School of Economics in 1938. Free Thai movement Thailand joined the Second World War on the side of the Axis in January 1942, following its invasion by Japan the previous month and the subsequent decision of Thailand's military ruler, Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, to ally with rather than resist the Japanese invaders. Puey's studies were as a result interrupted, and he joined the Free Thai Movement resisting the pro-Japanese government, helping to organise the movement in the United Kingdom. Puey was commissioned as a Captain into the British Army and underwent vigorous training with the Special Operations Executive, In November 1944 he parachuted into Chai Nat Province in northern Thailand as part of Operation APPRECIATION, intended to establish contact with the influential and anti-Japanese politician Pridi Banomyong. He was captured almost immediately, and remained technically a prisoner of war until the Japanese surrender in September 1945, though he in fact made contact with Free Thai members of the Thai police and was able to work with them from his jail cell. After the war, Puey was promoted to the rank of Majorhttps://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/37704/supplement/4341/data.pdf in the British forces and was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire. He resumed his studies, having won a Leverhulme Trust scholarship, and in 1948 received a doctorate in economics from the London School of Economics, becoming one of the first Thais to do so. Government service Ministry of Finance In 1949 Puey became an economist in the Ministry of Finance. In 1953 he was appointed managing director of the National Economic Council. Bank of Thailand In 1953, Puey was appointed Deputy Governor of the Bank of Thailand. Upon becoming governor in 1959, Puey quickly attracted the attention of international agencies, foreign governments, and the international financial community for the integrity of his financial planning and management. His international stature was recognised ceremoniously in 1964 when he became the first Thai to receive the Magsaysay Award for public service. Equally important, this international recognition gave him an influence with Field Marshals Sarit Thanarat, Thanom Kittikachorn, and their cohorts which far exceeded his bureaucratic position. They sought his aid and advice as a troubleshooter for Thailand's monetary interests, particularly in matters they had botched or in which they were suspected to have their own private interests, such as remedying Sarit's mishandling of Thailand's participation on an international tin council and preventing a kickback scandal over the foreign printing of Thailand's currency. Other positions After stepping down as central bank governor, Puey was appointed to the un-elected National Legislative Assembly established under the interim constitution of December 1972 in the aftermath of Thanom's 1971 auto-coup. After Thanom's junta was ousted in a popular uprising in 1973, Puey was chosen by caretaker prime minister Sanya Dharmasakti, who had also served as Rector of Thammasat University, to chair the government's Economic Advisory Council. He served in both posts until Sanya's ministry was succeeded by the elected government of Seni Pramoj following elections in 1975. Academic career In 1966 Puey became the dean of the Faculty of Economics at his alma mater, Thammasat University, where his work with the Rockefeller Foundation and with foreign scholars dramatically upgraded the training of Thailand's future technocrats. He also instituted a long-term research project on raising the productivity and economic level of Thai villagers. It was during this period that he was invited to serve as a visiting professor at both Cambridge and Princeton universities and was appointed to the governing boards of such organisations as the International Council for Educational Development, the East-West Center (EWC), the Asian Institute of Management, and the International Food Policy Research Institute. Puey played an instrumental role in the establishment of the Bangkok-based Asian Institute of Technology (AIT),http://www.ait.ac.th previously the Graduate School of Engineering of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO)Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in 1967. Dr Puey became the first chairperson of the AIT Board of Trustees from 1968 to 1973. After the ousting of Thanom's regime in October 1973, Puey was catapulted into political prominence and, along with M.R. Kukrit Pramoj, was broadly promoted as one of the two major candidates for the post of prime minister in the elected government that would follow the palace- picked interim administration of Sanya Thammasak. However, after a great deal of self-examination, Puey disavowed all interest in such a candidacy and returned to Thammasat, where he was appointed rector. Puey's explanation was that when he had joined the Free Thai Movement he had taken an oath never to seek or accept political appointment until after reaching the age of retirement. Some have argued, however, that Puey's withdrawal was based upon his mature understanding of the nature of society and that he had accurately foreseen that the upcoming democratic period would be inherently unstable, dangerous, and short-lived. Exile Puey Ungphakorn's relief in the 6 October 1976 Massacre Memorial, Thammasat University, Bangkok Despite his service, honesty and international reputation, Puey was branded a communist and \\"destroyer of unity\\" by the political right of Thailand. Although he spoke out against the unending student demonstrations of 1975‚Äì76 as being both ineffective and self-destructive, and even denied his students any use of the Thammasat campus as a base for mounting public demonstrations, he was nevertheless assigned blame for their occurrence. On the evening of the bloody 6 October 1976 Massacre, Puey resigned from his position as rector of Thammasat in protest against the bloodbath that had occurred that day on the university campus. Realising he was a marked man, Puey went to Don Mueang airport where he was met by a lynch mob. Only with the help of the Royal Thai Air Force Air Police, who had been instructed by King Bhumibol's privy council office to help him leave, did he evade death and get on a plane bound for London. While living abroad, Puey met with Thais and influential figures in several countries, including those in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Japan, and Australia to speak about the incident and to call for a peaceful transition to democracy in Thailand. In 1977, Puey gave testimonials before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs investigating human rights in Thailand following the incident of 6 October 1976 Massacre. In September 1977, Puey suffered a haemorrhagic stroke and was confined to a hospital for three months. The illness left Puey with a speech impediment resulting in mumbling speech. He could walk by himself, but was unable to control his right hand. Puey died in London on 28 July 1999. Legacy Puey's status as a hero derives from several obvious, but special, features of his career and character. His most significant, if paradoxical, attribute was his willingness to work for the Thai bureaucratic establishment and yet maintain his moral independence, intellectual creativity, and sense of social responsibility. His capacity to strike a compromise between what was objectively possible and morally desirable was an extraordinary accomplishment. It had a particular impact on younger people, almost all of whose models have traditionally been either successful rogues who manipulate their social environment for their own advantage or martyrs who succumb to it. Even more commendable was his deep sense of incorruptibility. Over the years, he held a variety of jobs and served on a number of commissions that, in terms of standard Thai corrupt practices, could have made him a very wealthy man. Further, Puey's incorruptibility was more than merely passive. As an economist he was keenly aware that official corruption was depriving the Thai treasury of inordinately large sums, and in public addresses and statements he would often include selections of thinly veiled, but cutting, poetic attacks against the specific acts of the very highest government officials. Puey's career is also powerful evidence of how education‚Äîin contrast to wealth, political power, and connections‚Äîcould be used to climb the Thai status ladder. In 2015 he was recognised by UNESCO for his high ethical standards.

He studied medicine at the University of Moscow and became a physician. As a young man, he became involved in Lithuanian political activities, and was persecuted by the Tsarist authorities. In 1896, he was one of the founders of the Lithuanian Democratic Party (LDP) and Lithuanian Popular Peasants' Union (LVLS) party. That same year he married Joana Pavalkytƒó.

L. lactis cells are cocci that group in pairs and short chains, and, depending on growth conditions, appear ovoid with a typical length of 0.5 - 1.5 ¬µm. L. lactis does not produce spores (nonsporulating) and are not motile (nonmotile). They have a homofermentative metabolism, meaning they produce lactic acid from sugars. They've also been reported to produce exclusive L-(+)-lactic acid.ROISSART, H. and Luquet F.M. Bact√©ries lactiques: aspects fondamentaux et technologiques. Uriage, Lorica, France, 1994, vol. 1, p. 605. However, reported D-(‚àí)-lactic acid can be produced when cultured at low pH. The capability to produce lactic acid is one of the reasons why L. lactis is one of the most important microorganisms in the dairy industry.Integr8 - Species search results: Based on its history in food fermentation, L. lactis has generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status with few case reports of being an opportunistic pathogen.Facklam RR, Pigott NE, Collins MD. Identification of Lactococcus species from human sources. Proceedings of the XI Lancefield International Symposium on Streptococci and Streptococcal Diseases, Siena, Italy. Stuttgart: Gustav Fischer Verlag; 1990:127 L. lactis is of crucial importance for manufacturing dairy products, such as buttermilk and cheeses. When L. lactis ssp. lactis is added to milk, the bacterium uses enzymes to produce energy molecules (ATP), from lactose. The byproduct of ATP energy production is lactic acid. The lactic acid produced by the bacterium curdles the milk that then separates to form curds, which are used to produce cheese.Lactococcus_lactis Other uses that have been reported for this bacterium include the production of pickled vegetables, beer or wine, some breads, and other fermented foodstuffs, such as soymilk kefir, buttermilk, and others.Lactococcus lactis uses L. lactis is one of the best characterized low GC Gram positive bacteria with detailed knowledge on genetics, metabolism and biodiversity. L. lactis is mainly isolated from either the dairy environment or plant material. Dairy isolates are suggested to have evolved from plant isolates through a process in which genes without benefit in the rich medium milk were either lost or down-regulated. This process, also called genome erosion or reductive evolution is also described in several other lactic acid bacteria. The proposed transition from the plant to the dairy environment was reproduced in the laboratory through experimental evolution of a plant isolate that was cultivated in milk for a prolonged period. Consistent with the results from comparative genomics (see references above) this resulted in L. lactis losing or down-regulating genes which are dispensable in milk and the up-regulation of peptide transport. Hundreds of novel small RNAs were identified by Meulen et al. in the genome of L. lactis MG1363. One of them: LLnc147 was shown to be involved carbon uptake and metabolism. Cheese production L. lactis subsp. lactis (formerly Streptococcus lactis) is used in the early stages for the production of many cheeses, including brie, camembert, Cheddar, Colby, Gruy√®re, Parmesan, and Roquefort. The state Assembly of Wisconsin, also the number one cheese-producing state in the United States, voted in 2010 to name this bacterium as the official state microbe. It would have been the first and only such designation by a state legislature in the nation, however the legislation was not picked up by the Senate. The legislation was introduced in November 2009 as Assembly Bill 556 by Representatives Hebl, Vruwink, Williams, Pasch, Danou, and Fields; it was cosponsored by Senator Taylor. The bill passed the Assembly on May 15, 2010, and was dropped by the Senate on April 28. The use of L. lactis in dairy factories is not without issues. Bacteriophages specific to L. lactis cause significant economic losses each year by preventing the bacteria from fully metabolizing the milk substrate. Several epidemiologic studies showed the phages mainly responsible for these losses are from the species 936, c2, and P335 (all from the family Siphoviridae). Therapeutic benefits The feasibility of using Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as functional protein delivery vectors has been widely investigated. Lactococcus lactis has been demonstrated to be a promising candidate for the delivery of functional proteins because of its noninvasive and nonpathogenic characters. Many different expression systems of L. lactis have been developed and used for heterologous protein expression. Lactose fermentation In Shuichi Nakamura‚Äôs, Yusuke V. Marimoto, and Seishi Kudo‚Äôs study, they seek to prove that some fermentation produced by L. lactis can hinder motility in pathogenic bacteria. The motilities of Pseudomonas, Vibrio and Leptospira strains were also severely disrupted by lactose utilization by L. lactis. Using Salmonella flagellar as the experimental group, Nakamura‚Äôs team found that a product of lactose fermentation is the cause of motility impairment in Salmonella. It is suggested that the L. lactis supernatant mainly affects Salmonella motility through disturbing flagellar rotation but not through irreversible damage against morphologies and physiologies. Lactose fermentation by L. lactis produces Acetate that reduces the intracellular pH of Salmonella, which in turn slow down the rotation of their flagella. These results highlight the potential use of L. lactis for preventing infections by multiple bacterial species. Secretion of Interleukin-10 Genetically engineered L. lactis can secrete the cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) for therapeutic intervention for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), since IL-10 has a central role in downregulating inflammatory cascades and matrix metalloproteinases. A study by Lothar Steidler and Wolfgang Hans shows that this in situ synthesis of IL-10 by genetically engineered L. lactis requires much lower doses than systemic treatments like antibodies to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or recombination IL-10. The authors propose two possible routes by which IL-10 can reach its therapeutic target. Genetically engineered L. lactis may produce murine IL-10 in the lumen, and the protein may diffuse to responsive cells in the epithelium or the lamina propria. Another route involves L. lactis taken up by M cells because of its bacterial size and shape, and the major part of the effect may be due to recombinant IL-10 production in situ in intestinal lymphoid tissue. Both routes may involve paracellular transport mechanisms that are enhanced in inflammation. After transport, IL-10 may directly down- regulate inflammation. In principle, this method may be useful for intestinal delivery of other protein therapeutics that are unstable or difficult to produce in large quantities and an alternative to the systemic treatment of IBD. Tumor-suppressor through Tumor metastasis-inhibiting peptide KISS1 Another study, led by Zhang B, created a L. lactis strain that maintains a plasmid containing a tumor metastasis-inhibiting peptide known as KISS1. L. lactis NZ9000 was demonstrated to be a cell factory for the secretion of biologically active KiSS1 protein, exerting inhibition effects on human colorectal cancer HT-29 cells. KiSS1 secreted from recombinant L. lactis strain effectively downregulated the expression of Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-9) ‚Äì a crucial key in the invasion, metastasis, and regulation of the signaling pathways controlling tumor cell growth, survival, invasion, inflammation, and angiogenesis. The reason for this is that KiSS1 expressed in L. lactis activates the MAPK pathway via GPR54 signaling, suppressing NFŒ∫B binding to the MMP-9 promoter and thus downregulating MMP-9 expression. This, in turn, reduces the survival rate, inhibits metastasis and induces dormancy of cancer cells. In addition, it was demonstrated that tumor growth can be inhibited by the LAB strain itself due to the LAB‚Äôs ability to produce exopolysaccharides. This study shows that L. lactisNZ9000 can inhibit HT-29 proliferation and induce cell apoptosis by itself. The success of this strain‚Äôs construction helped to inhibit migration and expansion of cancer cells, showing that the secretion properties of L. lactis of this particular peptide may serve as a new tool for cancer therapy in the future.

The subtitle of the symphony refers to the events of the Russian Revolution of 1905. However, the music may also reflect the Soviet liberation of Hungary, as the symphony was composed in the aftermath of the events. Shostakovich himself was quoted saying \\"don't forget that I wrote the symphony in the aftermath of Hungarian Uprising\\".Wilson, E. Shostakovich: A Life Remembered, pp. 360‚Äì361 The first performance given outside the Soviet Union took place in London's Royal Festival Hall on 22 January 1958 when Sir Malcolm Sargent conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The US Premiere was given by Leopold Stokowski and the Houston Symphony Orchestra on 7 April 1958. The symphony was conceived as a popular piece and proved an instant success in Russia‚Äîhis greatest, in fact, since the Leningrad Symphony fifteen years earlier.MacDonald, 214. The work's popular success, as well as its earning him a Lenin Prize in April 1958, marked the composer's formal rehabilitation from the Zhdanov Doctrine of 1948. A month after the composer had received the Lenin Prize, a Central Committee resolution \\"correcting the errors\\" of the 1948 decree restored all those affected by it to official favor, blaming their treatment on \\"J. V. Stalin's subjective attitude to certain works of art and the very adverse influence exercised on Stalin by Molotov, Malenkov and Beria\\".MacDonald, 214, 218‚Äì19. Instrumentation The symphony is scored for 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 3 oboes (3rd doubling cor anglais), 3 clarinets (3rd doubling bass clarinet), 3 bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon), 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, triangle, snare drum, cymbals, orchestral bass drum, tam-tam, xylophone, tubular bells, 2 harps (preferably doubled), celesta and strings. Structure Demonstrators march to the Winter Palace The symphony has four movements played without break, and lasts approximately one hour. The Eleventh is sometimes dubbed \\"a film score without the film\\". Indeed, the musical images have an immediacy and simplicity unusual even for Shostakovich the epic symphonist, and an additional thread is provided by the nine revolutionary songs that appear during the work. Some of these songs date back to the 19th century, others to the year 1905. Shostakovich does not merely quote these songs; he integrates them into the symphonic fabric within the bounds of his compositional style. This use of pseudo-folk material was a marked departure from his usual technique. However, it lent the symphony a strong emphasis on tonality and a generally accessible musical idiom.New Grove, 17:269. They were also songs the composer knew well. His family knew and sang them regularly while he was growing up.Volkov, 37‚Äì38. A line of armed soldiers facing peaceful demonstrators at the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg: still from the Soviet movie Devyatoe yanvarya \\"9th January\\" (1925) Overview Composition Shostakovich originally intended the Eleventh Symphony to mark the 50th anniversary of the Russian Revolution of 1905 and would have written it in 1955. Several personal factors kept him from composing the work until 1957. These factors included his mother's death, his tumultuous second marriage and the arrival of many newly freed friends from the Gulag. Events in Hungary in 1956 may have stirred Shostakovich out of his compositional inertia and acted as a catalyst for his writing the symphony.MacDonald, 216. Requiem for a generation According to the composer's son-in-law Yevgeny Chukovsky, the original title sheet for this symphony read not \\"1905\\" but \\"1906\\", the year of the composer's birth. This causes critics to view the Eleventh Symphony as a requiem not only for the composer himself but for his generation. Still, because the work was composed for the Revolution, its purpose is not lost. The 1905 Revolution was not politicised by the Party, so the piece maintained its romantic aura in the eyes of later generations. Because of this romantic aura, The Eleventh Symphony is among a group of diverse works that embody a spirit of struggle for a just cause, such as Sergei Eisenstein's film Battleship Potemkin and Boris Pasternak's narrative poems \\"1905\\" and \\"Lieutenant Schmidt.\\"Volkov, 39. The title, \\"The Year 1905\\", recalls the start of the first Russian Revolution of 1905, which was partially fired by the events on 9 January (9 January by the Julian calendar still in use in Russia at the time, modern date of 22 January 1905) of that year. Some Western critics characterized the symphony as overblown \\"film music\\" ‚Äì in other words, as an agitprop broadsheet lacking both substance and depth. Many now consider the work to carry a much more reflective attitude, one that looks at Russian history as a whole from the standpoint of 1957, four years after the death of Stalin. Most Mussorgskian symphony Regardless, Shostakovich considered this work his most \\"Mussorgskian\\" symphony. Mussorgsky for him symbolised two things‚Äîthe people and recurrence. Since it was about the people who suffered as a result of the Bloody Sunday, he wrote it in a simple, direct manner and stated \\"The people would basically be destined to suffer at the hands of indifferent autocrats; they would periodically protest in the name of humanity, only to be betrayed or punished.\\"MacDonald, 214‚Äì215. The composer reportedly told Solomon Volkov, \\"I wanted to show this recurrence in the Eleventh Symphony... It's about the people, who have stopped believing because the cup of evil has run over.\\"Quoted in MacDonald, 215. While this passage may have seemed far-fetched to some critics when Testimony first appeared, especially in the context of linking the symphony to the Hungarian Revolution, the concept of recurrence is reportedly one that has been central to Russian artists in the wake of that event and held tremendous significance among the intelligentsia in Russia.MacDonald, 215. The revolutionary song quotations in the work itself can support many interpretations: in the first movement, the song \\"Slushay!\\" (\\"Listen!\\") contains the text \\"The autumn night is ... black as the tyrant's conscience,\\" while the final movement refers to a piece including the words \\"shame on you tyrants\\", mixing with it motifs borrowed, with ironic or possibly bitter intent, from Richard Wagner‚Äôs Die Walk√ºre overture, during which Siegmund (later murdered) flees from his enemies through a forest. Volkov compares this movement's juxtaposition of revolutionary songs (notably the Varshavianska song) to a cinematic montage, while quoting Anna Akhmatova's description of it as \\"white birds against a black sky\\". Some have argued that Shostakovich's inclusion of these songs makes more explicit in the symphony the actual chain of consequences as well as events being portrayed‚Äînamely, that had Tsar Nicholas II listened to the people's demands and liberalized the government in 1905 to the point where widespread social change was enacted, there would not have been a recurrence of protest 12 years later to topple him from power.Figes, 261. Failing to listen, the tsar's head is bowed as he inherits the consequences portrayed in the symphony's finale. Thus, in Shostakovich's formal scheme for the symphony, denial of the people merely incites violence and a further cycle of recurrence. Cementing this message is the subtitle for the symphony's final movement, \\"Nabat\\" (translated in English as \\"tocsin\\" or \\"alarm\\" or \\"the alarm drum\\"). Nabat was also the title of a 19th-century review, edited by Narodnik Pyotr Tkachev, who was notorious for maintaining that nothing, however immoral, was forbidden from the true revolutionary. Tkachev advocated that revolution should be carried out by a small, motivated Party willing to use whatever means necessary, rather than by the people themselves.MacDonald, 217‚Äì218.  Hungarian Revolution  The similarities between the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 have led critics to believe that Shostakovich wrote the symphony in part as a response to the events of the Hungarian Revolution in Budapest. In both cases a peaceful uprising was put down with great force by the Russian government. Shostakovich himself speaks to the recurrence of events in Russian history in his testimony, stating that the Eleventh Symphony \\"deals with contemporary themes even though it's called '1905.'\\" His widow Irina has also said that he had the Hungarian Revolution \\"in mind\\" during composition.DSCH Journal, No. 12 p. 72. The symphony, which was finished in 1957, relayed themes of an oppressive government and its brutal policies towards revolts. The timing (being just one year after the Hungarian Revolution) strongly suggests that Shostakovich was speaking not only about events in his own country, but those events that his government was involved with. While the symphony incorporated enough revolutionary songs that it lay under the radar of the government, the underlying themes would have resonated fully with people at the time.

He is best known as a signatory to the U.S. Constitution, and for representing North Carolina at the Constitutional Convention. Williamson was a scholar of international renown. His erudition had brought him into contact with some of the leading intellectuals of the Patriot cause and, in turn, with the ferment of political ideas that eventually found expression in the Constitution. During the American Revolution, Williamson contributed his talents as physician and natural scientist to the American war effort. His experiences in that preeminent event of his generation transformed the genial scholar into an adroit politician and a determined leader in the campaign for effective national government. This leadership was evident not only at the Convention in Philadelphia but also, with telling effect, during the ratification debates in North Carolina. Williamson's career demonstrates the rootlessness that characterized the lives of many Americans even in the 18th century. Born on the frontier, he lived for significant periods of his long life in three different regions of the country. This mobility undoubtedly contributed to the development of his nationalistic outlook, an outlook strengthened by wartime service with interstate military forces and reinforced by the interests of the planters and merchants that formed his North Carolina constituency. These experiences convinced him that only a strong central government could adequately protect and foster the political, economic, and intellectual future of the new nation. Early years Williamson was born in West Nottingham Township, in what was then the frontier region of the Province of Pennsylvania. His fragile health as a youth weighed against his beginning a career in the family's clothier business. His parents instead sent him to Francis Alison's New London Academy and, in 1754, to the College of Philadelphia (today's University of Pennsylvania). Williamson graduated in the school's first class, on May 17, 1757, five days before his father died. After teaching at Philadelphia Academy, Williamson studied theology with his West Nottingham neighbor, the Rev. Samuel Finley (later president of the College of New Jersey, today's Princeton).He moved to Connecticut and obtained a preacher's license but his disillusionment with factional disputes within the Presbyterian Church and a resurgence of ill health led him to abandon a career in the ministry. Upon completing a master's degree at Philadelphia in 1760, Williamson joined his alma mater's faculty as a professor of mathematics. In another career shift four years later, Williamson turned to the study of medicine and doctricity. After spending a year at the University of Edinburgh, he matriculated in 1760s at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands,Album Studiosorum Academiae Rheno-Traiectinae MDCXXXVI-MDCCCLXXVI, kol. 162. wrote a brief thesis, and received his Medical Degree on August 6, 1764.Album Promotorum Academiae Rheno-Trajectinae 1636-1815, p. 177.English- speaking students of medicine at the University of Leyden / R.W.

He returned to Philadelphia to open a private practice. At the same time, he pursued a number of independent scientific and educational projects, and his work in these areas eventually led to membership in the American Philosophical Society as well as acclaim in Europe's intellectual circles. Interest in science and education indirectly led Williamson to politics and the Patriot cause. Sailing for England in 1773 to raise funds for a local educational project, Williamson stopped en route at Boston. There he witnessed the famous Boston Tea Party, in which Patriots dressed as American Indians destroyed a cargo of tea in protest over a newly enforced Parliamentary tax on imported commodities. On reaching London he was summoned before the Privy Council to testify on this act of rebellion and on colonial affairs in general. Williamson came of age politically during this encounter. In response to questions by Council members, who were in the process of formulating punitive measures against Massachusetts, he bluntly warned that repression would provoke rebellion. He then went on to express the argument that was becoming the core of the Patriot position: Americans were entitled to the full rights of Englishmen, including representation in the decisions of the English government. This testimony brought him to the attention of other Americans in London. A mutual interest in scientific matters cemented a solid working relationship with Benjamin Franklin, and Williamson soon found himself joined with the famous American scientist and others in appealing for support among those Englishmen who, in opposition to their own government, sympathized with American claims. Williamson continued on to the Netherlands where, taking advantage of the cover afforded by his attendance at meetings on scientific and educational subjects, he organized the publication of pamphlets and other papers that supported the Patriot cause. While there he learned that the colonies had declared their independence. He rushed back to Philadelphia in early 1777 and volunteered for service in the Medical Department of the Continental Army. The Department had no opening at that time, so Williamson decided to form a partnership with a younger brother to import medicines and other scarce items from the West Indies through the British blockade. Believing that he could best contribute to the war effort by using his contacts and reputation in this manner, Williamson made Edenton, North Carolina, his base of operations. Settlement in North Carolina soon led to his establishing a medical practice to serve the planters and merchants of the region. Military physician These various activities brought Williamson to the attention of North Carolina's political leaders. Facing the threat of a British invasion of the region from the sea and bases in Florida, the state legislature voted to raise a force of 4,000 men to assist South Carolina. When Governor Richard Caswell, with the rank of major general, took to the field at the head of these citizen-soldiers, he named Williamson to serve as the state's Physician and Surgeon General, a post Williamson held until the end of the war. The capture of Charleston, South Carolina in 1780 not only marked a stunning defeat for American forces, but also signaled the end of the first phase in a new British war strategy. Under this strategy British forces would continue to tie down Washington's main army in the north while a Royal army under General Charles Cornwallis would advance northward. Using Savannah, Georgia and Charleston as their bases of operations, the British expected their regular units to push through North Carolina and Virginia while a militia composed of local Loyalists secured areas captured by the regular forces. If successful, this strategy would have led to the conquest of the colonies from the south. To counter Cornwallis' efforts, the Continental Congress sent Horatio Gates to command a small force composed of a division of continentals, Caswell's units from North Carolina, and a group of hastily assembled Virginia militia units. Gates attempted to attack the British advance base near Camden, South Carolina, but his tired militia units, which were still forming when the battle began, were routed, and the Americans suffered another defeat. Williamson, who witnessed the disaster, volunteered to pass behind enemy lines to care for the American wounded. He spent two months on this mercy mission. When smallpox threatened the prison camp, he argued strenuously with Cornwallis and other British officers over the proper method to combat the disease. His perseverance and scientific reputation paid off. The British followed his advice, and an epidemic was averted. In the fall of 1780 Williamson returned to the field. Major General Nathanael Greene, Gates' replacement, had begun his brilliant campaign to recover the south through the joint efforts of continentals and militia. While his main force engaged the British in a series of battles, the militiamen concentrated on picking off small outposts and isolated enemy parties. Francis Marion, nicknamed \\"Swamp Fox\\", and others who operated mainly in South Carolina are most remembered for this type of guerrilla warfare, but North Carolina units also adopted these tactics. Williamson was attached to a force under Brigadier General Isaac Gregory whose mission was to limit British activity in eastern North Carolina. Gregory established his base in the vast reaches of the Dismal Swamp where he could pin the British down in Wilmington without jeopardizing his small force. Williamson's bold innovations in preventive medicine, especially his strenuous efforts to indoctrinate raw troops in the importance of sanitation and diet, kept the command virtually free of disease during the six months that it inhabited the swamp-‚Äîa rare feat in 18th-century warfare. Statesman Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States Key, Hugh Williamson, No 19 In 1782 Williamson's neighbors elected him to the lower house of the North Carolina legislature, where he served for several terms. He sat on numerous committees, including those formed to regulate veterans' rights, and he authored the state's copyright law. His fellow legislators also chose Williamson to serve in the Continental Congress in 1782. Appointment to this national body represented a natural political progression for Williamson, who was evolving into a champion of federalism. His experiences during the Revolution, especially his exposure to the pressing need for interstate cooperation during the 1780 and 1781 campaigns in the Carolinas, had convinced him of the military importance of strong national government. This interest increased when he came to realize the economic benefits that might accrue from the binding interstate association. In 1786 North Carolina chose Williamson to attend the Annapolis Convention, a meeting called to settle economic questions affecting the middle Atlantic states. Although he arrived too late to play a role in the Maryland proceedings, he was prepared to discuss interstate issues the following year when his state-appointed him as a representative at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. Williamson, a faithful attendee at Convention sessions, lodged with Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, two of the country's best-known nationalist leaders. His intellectual stature and international background also propelled him into a leadership role in the North Carolina delegation. A capacity for hard work and his innate good humor made him invaluable to the Federalists as they worked out the many political compromises necessary for consensus on the new instrument of government. On 11 July 1787, James Wilson of Pennsylvania proposed the three fifths compromise. It failed to pass (4:6), but a substantially similar motion was passed two days later. Williamson, like many other Founders, was opposed to the institution of slavery.Hugh Williamson (1735-1819) , University of Pennsylvania Shortly before the Convention adjourned, Williamson wrote a series of public letters in defense of a strong federal system. These \\"Letters of Sylvius\\" addressed many of the practical concerns of his state, where the rural and frequently debt-ridden farmers favored minimal government regulations, while the mercantile-planter group from the seaboard region wanted an economy strictly regulated by a central government. Using simple examples, Williamson explained to both groups the dual dangers of inflationary finances and of taxes that would stunt the growth of domestic manufacture. He exhorted North Carolinians to support the Constitution as the basis for their future prosperity. The ratification process, he explained, would decide whether the United States would remain a \\"system of patchwork and a series of expedients\\" or become \\"the most flourishing, independent, and happy nation on the face of the earth.\\" Following adjournment in Philadelphia, Williamson returned to New York to participate in the closing sessions of the Continental Congress and to serve as one of the agents settling North Carolina's accounts with that body. These duties caused him to miss the Hillsboro Convention, where North Carolina first considered and rejected the Constitution, but he played a major role at a second convention that met in Fayetteville in 1789. Here he participated in a successful effort to rally support for the Constitution. Williamson's grave at Trinity Church Cemetery. Williamson's neighbors elected him to represent them in the first federal Congress. He served two terms before retiring and settling in New York City, where he continued to pursue a wide range of scholarly interests. He wrote extensively about his research, joined numerous learned societies, and contributed to many charities. He also served as one of the original trustees of the University of North Carolina. Thomas Jefferson described Williamson's role at the Philadelphia Convention in the following terms: \\"he was a useful member, of an acute mind, attentive to business, and of a high degree of erudition.\\" Williamson married Maria Apthorpe in January 1789; she died after the birth of their second child in 1790. They had two sons, both of whom died young (the older one at the age of 22 in 1811, the younger, shortly thereafter, according to Hosack's Memoir of Hugh Williamson). Williamson was a Presbyterian, though some sources have identified him as a Deist.Deism and Social Ethics: The Role of Religion in the Third Millennium - Page 67, Robert Corfe - 2007 Williamson died and was buried in New York City. With not much known about his death, concluded to be by natural reasons.

Stockton and Dr. Eli Ayers negotiated to acquire the land in and around the bay from the native chiefs for a settlement by free negroes before sailing to Sierra Leone to pick up these colonists. On January 7, 1822, the former slaves arrived and settled Providence Island on the Mesurado River under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, and by April they had moved to the mainland. Within the next two decades, approximately 3,200 ex- slaves, having either escaped from their shareholders or being born free, arrived from Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, and Saint Lucia. As opportunities increased, former slaves moved through Grand Cape Mount, Bomi County, Montserrado and Margibi County to seek employment and prosperity. Many of the communities in the county are named for the pioneers who settled the area and their former homes in America. The Liberian Herald began printing in 1830 in Monrovia and was the first newspaper in Liberia.Starr, p. 71-73. In 1832, the Dey-Golah War erupted between the colonists and the native tribes.

They were later joined by keyboardist Zia McCabe and drummer Eric Hedford. Hedford left in 1998 and was replaced by Taylor-Taylor's cousin Brent DeBoer. The band's name is a play on the name of American pop artist Andy Warhol. The band gained recognition after they were signed to Capitol Records and released their major label album debut, ...The Dandy Warhols Come Down, in 1997. In 2001, the band rose to new levels of fame after their song \\"Bohemian Like You\\" enjoyed extensive exposure due to being featured in a Vodafone advertisement. The Dandy Warhols were the subject of the 2004 documentary film Dig!, along with San Francisco psychedelic outfit The Brian Jonestown Massacre. They have released 10 studio albums, two compilation albums, six EPs, and 27 singles to date. Biography Early years (1994‚Äì1995) Original drummer Eric Hedford in 1997 The Dandy Warhols were formed in Portland, Oregon in 1994 by Courtney Taylor-Taylor and Peter Holmstr√∂m. Soon after, drummer Eric Hedford joined, and, following an unsuccessful experiment with Taylor-Taylor's girlfriend on bass guitar, Zia McCabe joined the band as keyboardist after Taylor-Taylor saw her working in a coffeehouse. Taylor- Taylor described the band's beginning as a group of friends who \\"needed music to drink to\\". Early on in their career, The Dandy Warhols performed in bars throughout Portland and became well known for their nudity-filled live shows. At their first gig in 1994, they were approached by record label Tim/Kerr, who offered to pay for the recording of an album. The result was 1995's Dandys Rule OK. Musically, Dandys Rule OK combined elements of 1960s garage rock, the then-popular Britpop genre, and a shoegaze approach. Signing to Capitol and ...The Dandy Warhols Come Down (1996‚Äì1998) Courtney Taylor-Taylor in 2011 Major record label Capitol Records were impressed by Dandys Rule OK, and decided to sign the band. In 1997, they released their second studio album, ...The Dandy Warhols Come Down. It was their second attempt at a follow-up album, after their first attempt was rejected by Capitol, who claimed it didn't have any \\"hits\\". Three singles were released for Come Down, all of which entered the Top 40 in the UK charts. Being their first record on a major label, Come Down featured a more commercial, polished sound, abandoning the garage rock sound of the previous album in favor of a more psychedelic and power pop-influenced sound. In 1998, drummer Eric Hedford left the band after a dispute over royalties, and was replaced by Taylor-Taylor's cousin Brent DeBoer. Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia and mainstream popularity (1998‚Äì2001) In 2000, the band released their third studio album, Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia. It was a critical and commercial success, due mainly to the single \\"Bohemian Like You\\" being featured in a popular Vodafone advertisement as well as on the TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The song has also been featured in the animated movie Flushed Away in a chase scene, and on the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack for the film Igby Goes Down. Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia featured a less overdriven sound, with less overt psychedelia and more stylings in common with the power pop genre. Around this time, Taylor-Taylor took out a loan to acquire an industrial warehouse space in northwest Portland, dubbed \\"The Odditorium\\" and occupying a quarter city block. The Odditorium is the band's eclectic rehearsal space and recording and mixing studio. It also serves as an art space and clubhouse for parties and other events. It opened on November 15, 2001. Welcome to the Monkey House (2001‚Äì2003) Peter Holmstr√∂m at the 2001 Frequency Festival Becoming a fan of the band after seeing them play at the Glastonbury Festival in 2000, David Bowie personally selected The Dandy Warhols to play at the 2002 Meltdown festival. Bowie and the Dandys played a rendition of The Velvet Underground's \\"White Light/White Heat\\" together as an encore to the July 29 gig, which was billed as The New Heathens Night. The band also supported Bowie on his 2003 A Reality Tour. In September 2001, the band began work on their next studio album. The result was Welcome to the Monkey House, released in 2003. Produced by Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran, the album featured a major shift towards a 1980s-influenced synthpop sound. The album was spearheaded by its first single, \\"We Used to Be Friends\\", which went on to become one of the band's most popular tracks, gaining exposure through use as the theme song for the American cult television show Veronica Mars, as well as an appearance in The O.C. Two further singles, \\"You Were the Last High\\" and \\"Plan A\\", were released in promotion of the album. This song was also featured in EA sport FIFA 2004. Dig!, and other developments (2004) Along with band The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Dandy Warhols were the subjects of the 2004 documentary film Dig!. The film captured a love‚Äìhate relationship between the two bands, highlighting the interaction of Taylor-Taylor and BJM frontman Anton Newcombe. It was recorded over the course of seven years by filmmaker Ondi Timoner, and won the Documentary Grand Jury Prize at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival.

Odditorium or Warlords of Mars (2004‚Äì2007) The Dandy Warhols at the Summercase festival in 2006 The Dandy Warhols started work on their next studio album in mid-2004. The result was Odditorium or Warlords of Mars, released the following year. It was partially named after and recorded in the band's own studio, The Odditorium. Odditorium or Warlords of Mars was largely a return to the psychedelic, guitar-orientated rock of ...The Dandy Warhols Come Down, moving away from the synth-heavy sound of their previous album, Welcome to the Monkey House. Two singles were released from the album: \\"Smoke It\\" and \\"All the Money or the Simple Life Honey\\". The album received a mixed response from music critics. Around this time, the band contributed to the soundtrack of the video game Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse with a cover of \\"All I Have to Do Is Dream\\" by The Everly Brothers. On July 17, 2006, the band released a stand-alone single, \\"Have a Kick Ass Summer (Me and My Friends)\\". The song was later re-recorded as \\"Mis Amigos\\" for their 2008 album ...Earth to The Dandy Warhols...

This Machine (2011‚Äì2013) Brent DeBoer at the Austin Psych Fest in 2014 That same year, the band announced they were recording a new album. While playing in Sydney's Enmore Theatre in May 2011 as part of their 2011 Australian tour, lead singer Courtney Taylor- Taylor announced the new album would be titled This Machine (after previously jokingly that it would be called either The Pastor of Muppets, Shitty Shitty Band Band or Whirled Piece in blog posts on the band's official website). On the same tour, the band debuted two new tracks from the album, \\"Seti vs. the Wow! Signal\\" and \\"Rest Your Head\\". The Dandy Warhols \\"re-arranged and performed\\" the theme music to the popular science-based television show MythBusters. The updated theme music first appeared midway through the 2011 season, in the episode \\"Bikes and Bazookas\\". This subsequent theme was a revamp of the original and was used until the show had an overhaul starting in the 2015 season (thereby discontinuing the theme at the end of the 2014 season). The band announced the release of the new album's first single, \\"Well They're Gone\\", on March 1, 2012, allowing visitors to download the track for free after entering their email address. A video for the track \\"Sad Vacation\\" was released on April 16. This Machine was released on April 24, 2012. The album featured a collaboration with David J on the track \\"Autumn Carnival\\".

Early life Coat of Arms of William Samuel Johnson William Samuel Johnson was born in Stratford, Connecticut, on October 7, 1727 to Samuel Johnson, a well-known Anglican clergyman and later president of King's (Columbia) College, and Johnson's first wife, Charity Floyd Nicoll. Johnson received his primary education at home. He then graduated from Yale College in 1744, going on to receive a master's degree from his alma mater in 1747 (as well as an honorary degree from Harvard the same year). Although Johnson's father urged him to enter the clergy, Johnson decided to pursue a legal career. Self- educated in law he quickly established various business connections. Johnson also held a commission in the Connecticut colonial militia for over 20 years, earning the rank of colonel. He also served in the lower house of the Connecticut legislature years 1761 and 1765. He was also a member of the colony's supreme court in the years 1772‚Äì1774. William Samuel Johnson also attended the Stamp Act Congress in 1765 and served on the committee that addressed the King arguing the right of the colonies to decide tax policies for themselves. Career Although his father urged him to enter the clergy, Johnson decided instead to pursue a legal career. Self-educated in the law, he quickly developed an important clientele and established business connections extending beyond the boundaries of his native colony. He also held a commission in the Connecticut colonial militia for over 20 years, rising to the rank of colonel, and he served in the lower house of the Connecticut Legislature (1761 and 1765) and in the upper house (1766 and 1771‚Äì1775). Additionally, he was a member of the colony's Supreme Court (1772‚Äì1774). He was first attracted to the Patriot cause by what he and his associates considered Parliament's unwarranted interference in the government of the colonies. He attended the Stamp Act Congress in 1765 and served on the committee that drafted an address to the King arguing the right of the colonies to decide tax policies for themselves. He opposed the Townshend Acts passed by Parliament in 1767 to pay for the French and Indian War and supported the non-importation agreements devised by the colonies to protest taxation without representation. American Revolution Johnson lived in London from 1767 to 1771, serving as Connecticut's agent in its attempt to settle the colony's title to Indian lands. He sharply criticized British policy toward the colonies. His experience in Britain convinced him that Britain's policy was shaped more by ignorance of American conditions and not through the sinister designs of a wicked government, as many Patriots alleged. As the Patriots became more radical in their demands, Johnson found it difficult to commit himself wholeheartedly to the cause. Although he believed British policy unwise, he found it difficult to break his own connections with the mother country. A scholar of international renown, he had many friends in Britain and among the American Loyalists. As the famous English author, Samuel Johnson, said of him, \\"Of all those whom the various accidents of life have brought within my notice, there is scarce anyone whose acquaintance I have more desired to cultivate than yours.\\" He was also bound to Britain by religious and professional ties. He enjoyed close associations with the Anglican Church in England and with the scholarly community at Oxford, which awarded him an honorary degree in 1766. Fearing the consequences of independence for both the colonies and the mother country, Johnson sought to avoid extremism and to reach a compromise on the outstanding political differences between the protagonists. He rejected his election to the First Continental Congress, a move strongly criticized by the Patriots, who removed him from his militia command. He was also strongly criticized when seeking an end to the fighting after Lexington and Concord, he personally visited the British commander, General Thomas Gage. The incident led to his arrest for communicating with the enemy, but the charges were eventually dropped. He felt that the American Revolution was not necessary and that independence would be bad for everyone concerned.Elizabeth P. McCaughey, \\"William Samuel Johnson, The Loyal Whig\\" in William M. Fowler Jr. and Wallace Coyle, eds. American Revolution: Changing Perspectives (1979), pp. 69‚Äì102 New nation Once independence was achieved, Johnson felt free to participate in the government of the new nation, serving in the Congress of the Confederation (1785‚Äì1787). His influence as a delegate was recognized by his contemporaries. Jeremiah Wadsworth wrote of him to a friend, \\"Dr. Johnson has, I believe, much more influence than either you or myself. The Southern Delegates are vastly fond of him.\\" In 1785, the Vermont Republic granted Johnson a town in the former King's College Tract in thanks for representing the interests of Vermont before the Continental Congress. The town of Johnson, Vermont, the small university Johnson State College, and Johnson Street in Madison, Wisconsin bear his name. Constitutional Convention In 1787, Johnson played a major role as one of the Philadelphia Convention's delegates. His eloquent speeches on the subject of representation carried great weight during the debate. He looked to a strong federal government to protect the rights of Connecticut and the other small states from encroachment by their more powerful neighbors. He supported the New Jersey Plan, which called for equal representation of the states in the national legislature. In general, he favored extension of federal authority. He argued that the judicial power \\"ought to extend to equity as well as law\\" (the words \\"in law and equity\\" were adopted at his motion). He denied that there could be treason against a separate state since sovereignty was \\"in the Union.\\" He opposed prohibition of any ex post facto law, one which made an act a criminal offense retroactively because such prohibition implied \\"an improper suspicion of the National Legislature.\\" Johnson was influential even in the final stages of framing the Constitution. He gave his fullest support to the Connecticut Compromise, which foreshadowed the final Great Compromise, with a national legislature with a Senate that provided equal representation for all states and a House of Representatives based on population. He also served on and chaired the five-member Committee of Style, which framed the final form of the document. In her 1966 book, Miracle at Philadelphia, Catherine Drinker Bowen called Johnson \\"the perfect man to preside over these four masters of argument and political strategy [i.e. fellow committee members Alexander Hamilton, Gouverneur Morris, James Madison, and Rufus King].... His presence on the committee must have been reassuring; the doctor's quiet manner disarmed.\\"Bowen, p.235 of the 1986 edition  References   Sources   * Graff, Nancy Price.

He was the first head of state of Lithuania after its independence declaration from the Soviet Union, and served as the Head of the Lithuanian Parliament Seimas. He has written 20 books on a variety of topics, including a biography of Mikalojus Konstantinas ƒåiurlionis, as well as works on politics and music. He is a founding signatory of the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism, and a member of the international advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.  Biography  Vytautas Landsbergis was born in Kaunas, Lithuania. His father was the famous architect Vytautas Landsbergis-≈Ωemkalnis and his mother, ophthalmologist Dr. Ona Jablonskytƒó- Landsbergienƒó in 1944 sheltered a Jewish teenager in the family home. For this act she was awarded the title of a Righteous Among the Nations by Israel.Encyclopedia of the Righteous Among the Nations, Rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust ‚Äì Europe (Part II), pp. 210‚Äì211 (2011) In 1952 he placed third in the Lithuanian chess championship, after Ratmir Kholmov and Vladas Mikƒónas. In 1955, he graduated from the Lithuanian Conservatory of Music (now Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre). In 1969, he wrote his thesis for his PhD degree. In 1978, he became a Professor at the Lithuanian Conservatory. From 1978 to 1990, he was a professor at both the Lithuanian Conservatory and the Vilnius Pedagogical University. In 1994, he wrote a thesis for his doctor habilitus degree.  Family  Landsbergis is married to Gra≈æina Ruƒçytƒó- Landsbergienƒó (b. 1930), a well-known Lithuanian pianist and associate Professor of the Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theater. His daughters J≈´ratƒó and Birutƒó are also musicians. His son, Vytautas, is a well-known Lithuanian writer and film director. His grandson Gabrielius Landsbergis (b. 1982) is the current leader of the conservative party and a member of Lithuanian Parliament.  Political career  Landsbergis entered politics, in 1988, as one of the founders of SƒÖj≈´dis, the Lithuanian pro-independence political movement. After SƒÖj≈´dis' victory in the 1990 elections, he became the Chairman of the Supreme Council of Lithuania. On 11 March 1990, he headed the Parliamentary session during which the restoration of Lithuanian independence from the Soviet Union was declared. Lithuania became the first Soviet Republic to do so. According to the temporary Constitution of Lithuania, Landsbergis had constitutional authority over both the Leader of the State and the Speaker of the Parliament. He held this post from March 1990 until the next elections in November 1992. The Soviet Union attempted to stifle this activity by economic blockade in 1990, but it failed, and other Soviet Republics soon followed suit and declared their independence from Moscow, as well. He was also extremely dubious of the view that Mikhail Gorbachev was trying to liberalize the Soviet Union and that Lithuania should not prevent him from doing so. Landsbergis also played a crucial role during the confrontation between the Lithuanian independence movement and Soviet armed forces in January 1991. Iceland was the first state that officially recognized the restoration of Lithuanian independence; Landsbergis was somewhat critical of certain Western powers (such as the United States and United Kingdom) for not showing enough support in Lithuania's bid to restore its independence after more than 40 years of Soviet occupation, although he did accept the recommendation from his government that the newly independent Lithuania immediately seek to establish full diplomatic relations with the UK and US. In 1993, Landsbergis led much of SƒÖj≈´dis into a new political party, the Homeland Union (Tƒóvynes SƒÖjunga). It gained a landslide victory in the 1996 parliamentary elections. Landsbergis served as Speaker of the Seimas from 1996 until 2000. He ran, although unsuccessfully, for President in 1997 (coming up the third after receiving 15.9% of the votes). During the runoff, he supported Valdas Adamkus, who had finished second in the first round. V. Adamkus eventually became President. In 2004, Landsbergis was elected by Lithuanian voters to the European Parliament in Brussels (the total number of MEPs from Lithuania in Brussels is 13), and has been returned at every election since then. In 2005, Landsbergis became an international patron of the newly formed Henry Jackson Society. Since 2015 Landsbergis is together with Roswitha Fessler-Ketteler, MEP Heidi Hautala, Aleksi Malmberg and Frank Schwalba-Hoth member of the advisory board of the Caucasian Chamber Orchestra association and its German \\"F√∂rderverein\\". Attempt to ban Communist and Nazi insignia In January 2005, Landsbergis, backed by Member of the European Parliament from Hungary Jozsef Szajer, urged that Communist symbols be banned in the European Union, in addition to Nazi symbols. He also sent a letter to Franco Frattini, the European Commissioner of Justice and Internal Affairs, suggesting that in case the EU decides to ban Nazi symbols, Communist symbols should be banned too. The Commissioner became interested in this proposal and said: I am ready to join this discussion. The Communist dictatorships no less than the Nazi ones are responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of people. A bit later, however, the Commissioner decided that he would not attempt to ban any symbols, as there was no agreement as to which symbols should be banned. Landsbergis's proposal caused quite a stir in Italy, where leftists strongly protested such a move. The Communist Refoundation Party and Party of Italian Communists were outraged at the proposal. It became the center of Italian media's attention. One of the most influential Italian dailies, La Repubblica, published an interview with Landsbergis outlining his proposal. It was the first time the daily allocated a full page to a politician from Lithuania. Landsbergis's proposal found few supporters among Italian politicians. One was Alessandra Mussolini, a granddaughter of former Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, who commented: \\"To implement the proposal of the Members of the European Parliament regarding Communist symbols is our moral duty\\". Landsbergis's proposal was opposed by the Russian Parliament as well. The First Vicespeaker of the Russian State Duma called the proposal \\"abnormal\\". Another Russian MP, a communist, commented that \\"somebody in Europe became insolent and forgot who saved them from the fascists\\". The debate came to an end when, in the beginning of February 2005, the European Commission rejected calls for a proposed Europe-wide ban on Nazi symbols to be extended to cover Communist Party symbols as well. Frattini said it would not be appropriate to include the red star and the hammer and sickle in a draft EU law on racism. Finally, at the end of February 2005, the European Union dropped proposals to ban Nazi symbols across its 25 member states. Luxembourg withdrew the plan when it became clear that members could not reach a consensus on which symbols to ban. There were also concerns that the proposed ban was a threat to freedom of expression. Landsbergis is a fierce critic of Russia's intentions to impose any kind of influence on the Baltic States and publicly questions Russia's actions vis-√†-vis the Baltic States on both local and international media, as well as in the European Parliament. He warns that Russia might have intentions to control Lithuania and the other Baltic States economically and politically through a wide network of former KGB agents and other clandestine activities. Landsbergis is one of the most active politicians who urge Russia to compensate Lithuania and other post-Soviet republics for damage done to them during their occupations. Vytautas Landsbergis plays piano in Sanok at Cultural Center salon, 2013 Comments on Vilnius street and memorial renaming controversy In 2019, Vilnius's mayor, Remigijus ≈†ima≈°ius, renamed a street that had been named after Kazys Skirpa (who formed the Lithuanian Activist Front, which massacred Jews across Lithuania) and removed a memorial to Jonas Noreika (who ordered and oversaw the killings of Lithuanian Jews in Plungƒó during the Plungƒó massacre).

She was a member of the Australian House of Representatives from October 1998 to May 2016, representing the Division of Chisholm, Victoria. From October 2012 to November 2013, she was Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives. Early life Burke was born in Melbourne and educated at Presentation College, Windsor. She graduated from Monash University in 1988 with a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honours in English Literature, and later from the University of Melbourne in 1994 with a Master of Commerce with Honours in Industrial Relations and Human Resource Management. Before entering politics, Burke worked as a trade union official and human resources manager. In this capacity, she worked for Victoria Roads from 1988 to 1993 and for Victoria University (then the Victorian Institute of Technology) from 1993 to 1994. In 1994, she joined the Finance Sector Union as their National Industrial Officer. Retrieved 16 October 2015 Politics Early years She had joined the Ashwood branch of the Labor Party in 1986, and in 1997 she was pre- selected for the Division of Chisholm by the Labor Party. The division was then held by Liberal Minister for Health and Family Services Michael Wooldridge. She was not expected to win, but after Wooldridge switched seats she won the seat at the 1998 federal election Retrieved 16 October 2015 against Peter Vlahos of the Liberal Party. Role as Deputy Speaker and Speaker After Labor's win at the 2007 federal election, Burke was elected as Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives. She successfully defended her seat in the 2010 federal election. On 24 November 2011, she was nominated by the Opposition for the position of Speaker of the House, which she declined. However, she accepted the Government's nomination for the position of Deputy Speaker on the same day, and was elected to that position following a ballot. On 22 April 2012 the Speaker, Peter Slipper, announced he was standing aside, meaning he would remain Speaker but would not attend sessions of the House, until fraud allegations made against him with respect to travel expenses were resolved. The Opposition called for Slipper to stay away from the chamber until sexual harassment charges were resolved as well. As Deputy Speaker, Burke was deprived of her deliberative vote, being able only to vote in the case of a tie. On 9 October 2012, Peter Slipper resigned as Speaker of the House. Later that evening, Burke was nominated and elected the new Speaker of the House of Representatives unopposed. Her tenure as Speaker ended when her party lost government in 2013. She then sought to become chief opposition whip but was not successful.https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/anna- burke-slams-labors-frontbench-carve-up-20131015-2vjfj.html Retirement from politics On 16 December 2015, Burke announced that she would not re-contest her seat at the 2016 federal election. She was replaced as the Member for Chisholm by Liberal Julia Banks, who was the only Coalition candidate to win a seat held by an opposition party in 2016. On 16 January 2017, Burke was appointed as a full-time Member of the General, Freedom of Information, and Veterans' Appeals Divisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, with her term to end on 15 January 2024. In the 2019 Australia Day Honours Burke was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for \\"distinguished service to the Parliament of Australia, particularly as Speaker of the House of Representatives, and to the community\\".

Tamatori steals the Dragon King's jewel, woodblock print by Utagawa Kuniyoshi. La Grande danse macabre des vifs by Martin van Ma√´le is a type of pornography most commonly found in Japan which integrates traditional pornography with elements of bestiality and a fantasy, horror, or science-fiction theme. It is found in some horror or hentai titles, with tentacled creatures (usually fictional monsters) having sexual intercourse, predominantly with females. Tentacle erotica can be consensual but frequently contains elements of rape. The genre is popular enough in Japan that it is the subject of parody. In the 21st century, Japanese films of this genre have become more common in the United States and Europe, although it still remains a small, fetish-oriented part of the adult film industry. While most tentacle erotica is animated, there are also a few live action movies. History Creatures with tentacles appeared in Japanese erotica long before animated pornography. Among the most famous of the early instances is an illustration from the 1814 Hokusai Katsushika novel Kinoe no komatsu popularly known as The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife. It is an example of shunga (Japanese erotic woodblock art) and has been reworked by a number of artists. Masami Teraoka brought the image up to date with his 2001 work \\"Sarah and Octopus/Seventh Heaven\\", part of his Waves and Plagues collection. A scholarly paper by Danielle TalericoTalerico, Danielle. ‚ÄúInterpreting Sexual Imagery in Japanese Prints: A Fresh Approach to Hokusai‚Äôs Diver and Two Octopi‚Äù, in Impressions, The Journal of the Ukiyo-e Society of America, Vol. 23 (2001). showed that although western audiences often interpret Hokusai's famous design as rape, Japanese audiences of the Edo period would have viewed it as consensual. They would have recognized the print as depicting the legend of the female abalone diver Tamatori. In the story, Tamatori steals a jewel from the Dragon King. During her escape, the Dragon King and his sea-life minions (including octopodes) pursue her. The dialogue in the illustration shows the diver and two octopodes expressing mutual enjoyment. Contemporary censorship in Japan dates to the Meiji period. The influence of European Victorian culture was a catalyst for legislative interest in public sexual mores. Post- WWII, the Allies imposed a number of reforms on the Japanese government including anti-censorship laws. The legal proscriptions against pornography, therefore, derive from the nation's penal code. At present, ‚Äúobscenity‚Äù is still prohibited. How this term is interpreted has not remained constant. While exposed genitalia (and, until recently, pubic hair) are illegal, the diversity of permissible sexual acts is now wide compared with other liberal democracies. Leaders within the tentacle porn industry have stated that much of their work was initially directed at circumventing this policy. The animator Toshio Maeda stated: ‚ÄúAt that time pre-Urotsukid≈çji, it was illegal to create a sensual scene in bed. I thought I should do something to avoid drawing such a normal sensual scene. So I just created a creature. His tentacle is not a penis as a pretext. I could say, as an excuse, this is not a penis; this is just a part of the creature. You know, the creatures, they don't have a gender. A creature is a creature. So it is not obscene ‚Äì not illegal.\\"Manga Artist Interview Series (Part 1), 2002 Culture Animation The earliest animated form of tentacle assault was in the 1985 anime hentai OVA Dream Hunter Rem, though the scene in question was excised when the OVA was re-released in a non-hentai form. The first entirely non- hentai anime production portraying a tentacle assault would be 1986 anime OVA Guyver: Out of Control, where a female Chronos soldier named Valcuria (voiced by Keiko Toda) is enshrouded by the 2nd (damaged) Guyver unit that surrounds her in tentacle form and penetrates all orifices. Numerous animated tentacle erotica films followed the next couple decades, with more popular titles such as 1986's Urotsukidoji, 1992's La Blue Girl and 1995's Demon Beast Resurrection becoming common sights in large video store chains in the United States and elsewhere. The volume of films in this genre has slowed from the peak years in the 1990s but continue to be produced to the present day. Manga In 1989, Toshio Maeda's manga Demon Beast Invasion created what might be called the modern Japanese paradigm of tentacle porn, in which the elements of sexual assault are emphasized. Maeda explained that he invented the practice to get around strict Japanese censorship regulations, which prohibit the depiction of the penis but apparently do not prohibit showing sexual penetration by a tentacle or similar (often robotic) appendage. Live action The use of sexualized tentacles in live action films, while much rarer, started in American B-movie horror films and has since migrated back to Japan. B-movie producer Roger Corman used the concept of tentacle rape in a brief scene in his 1970 film The Dunwich Horror, a film adaptation of the H. P. Lovecraft short story of the same name. Vice magazine identifies this as \\"perhaps cinema history's first tentacle-rape scene\\". A decade later, Corman would again use tentacle rape while producing Galaxy of Terror, released in 1980. Arguably the most notorious example of tentacle rape to date, Corman directed a scene in which actress Taaffe O'Connell, playing an astronaut on a future space mission is captured, raped, and killed by a giant, tentacled worm. The film borrows the concept of the \\"id monster\\" from the 1950s film Forbidden Planet, with the worm being a manifestation of the O'Connell character's fears. The scene was graphic enough that the film's director, B. D. Clark, refused to helm it, and O'Connell refused to do the full nudity required by Corman, so Corman directed the scene himself and used a body double for some of the more graphic shots. Initially given an X-rating by the Motion Picture Association of America, tiny cuts were made to the scene which changed the movie's rating to 'R'. An even more popular film from 1981, Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead, has actress Ellen Sandweiss' character being attacked by the possessed woods she is walking in. The evil spirit inhabiting the woods uses tree limbs and branches to ensnare, strip, and rape her, \\"entering\\" (i.e., possessing) her through the sexual act in a way very similar to that in which tentacles are normally depicted. The scene was repeated in a much shorter version in the sequel, Evil Dead II, released in 1987. Another film, this time dealing with the life of artist Katsushika Hokusai, was the Japanese made 1981 film Edo Porn, which featured the far-famed Dream of the Fisherman's Wife painting in a live action depiction. In the film Possession (also from 1981) a woman copulates with a tentacled creature, although the tentacles themselves are never explicitly expressed as penetrating her. The popularity of these films has led to the subsequent production of numerous live action tentacle films in Japan from the 1990s to the present day. The theme has appeared more rarely in adult American cinema and art; one example is American artist Zak Smith, who has painted works featuring octopuses and porn stars in various stages of intercourse. In 2016, Amat Escalante directed an art house movie called The Untamed which depicts a live action scene between the female protagonist and a tentacled space alien.

These events do not include the several different forms of debate offered by many tournaments. These events are called individual events because they tend to be done by one person unlike debate which often includes teams. This distinction however is not entirely accurate any more given the addition of duo interpretation events and forms of single person debate. Competitive speech competitions and debates comprise the area of forensics. Forensics leagues have a number of speech events, generally determined by geographical region or league preference. While there are several key events that have been around a long time, there are several experimental events around the country every year that can be limited to individual tournaments. Forensics leagues in the United States includes the National Speech and Debate Association, the National Christian Forensics and Communications Association, the American Forensics Association, the National Forensics Association, the Interstate Oratorical Association and Stoa USA. Organized competitions are held at the high-school and collegiate level. Outside of the rules for each event provided by the individual leagues, there are several cultural norms within each region that are not written into law but are almost always followed. Rules for time limits vary by event and by individual tournaments, but there are penalties in every event for exceeding the time limits though the severity of the penalty widely varies.  Public-speaking events  The public speaking events are typically memorized speeches that can be on any topic the competitor desires. Typically, the same speech is used for the entire competitive season but may not be used in more than one season. For the public speaking events, they are performed with the purpose to use information to relate a message to an audience.  Original Oratory  In Original Oratory, a competitor prepares an original speech which may be informative or persuasive in nature. A competitor may use one speech for the entire season. The purpose of Oratory is to inspire belief or reinforce conviction. At the high-school level, the speech is generally delivered without visual aids or notes. In many leagues (including the two U.S. tournaments), the number of directly-quoted words from other sources in the speech is limited; at the NFL nationals, the limit is 150 words. Speeches are generally eight to ten minutes in length, with a warning often given when the allowed time has expired; most tournaments have a 30-second grace period.  Persuasion  Persuasion is often considered the collegiate equivalent of Oratory. The focus of the event is to change, reinforce, or instill the attitudes, beliefs, and values of the audience. Although few rules that dictate what topics or formats are permissible in persuasion, most persuasion speeches are policy-based; speakers advocate a specific policy proposal to address a need, offering their recommendation in a problem-cause-solution or cause-effect-solution format. In 2006, the winning persuasion topics at the American Forensics Association (AFA) and National Forensics Association (NFA) were how to improve teacher retention and encourage citizens to correspond with their members of Congress. This style of speech is also featured at the Interstate Oratorical Association - the oldest public speaking organization in the US - where the top persuasive speakers from each state compete at an annual national contest.  Informative  Informative speaking, also known as Expository Address, is a speech meant to inform the audience. The speech may range from the newest, high tech inventions from around the world to cure cancer to lighthearted topics, such as Wikipedia. The speech is supposed to be objective, without any judgement or evaluation of the topic. The speaker's job is to make a complex topic easier to understand. In intercollegiate competition, the time limit is ten minutes and the speech is typically memorized. In high-school competition, time limits vary by U.S. state. Some informative speeches use visual aids; visual aids and puns (or wordplay) are emphasized in California, although neither are required. Declamation  Declamation, or memorized speech, is the high-school interpretation and presentation of a non-original speech. Speeches may be historical (such as Martin Luther King Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech) or adapted from magazine articles, commencement addresses, or other adaptations of non-original material (including forensics speeches from previous years). Declamations are generally persuasive, and the competition is similar to Original Oratory. Like Oratory, speeches are about eight minutes long. Rhetorical criticism  Rhetorical criticism, or communication analysis, is an individual collegiate event in which the speaker has ten minutes to present a speech. The speech usually consists of an introduction, the presentation of a rhetorical artifact, a communication theory or model, the application of the communication theory to the artifact, the implications of that analysis, and a conclusion. The artifact may be anything of rhetorical significance, such as a book, a speech, an advertising campaign, or a protest movement. The speaker identifies the goals the artifact seeks to accomplish. They then select a model form of analysis (typically borrowed from communication scholars) to determine the effectiveness of the artifact in reaching its goal; for example, in analyzing an anti-smoking campaign the speaker might choose a model discussing the most effective methods of employing fear to persuade a mass audience. They would then apply the model to the artifact and draw conclusions about the artifact's strengths and weaknesses, the success or failure of the model as an analytical tool, and other insight gained from the analysis. Special-occasion speaking  Special-occasion speaking, a high-school event, is similar to Oratory but focuses on lighter subjects and addresses a specific audience. Although comedy is frequently heard in special-occasion speaking, it should not detract from the message the speaker is trying to relate. The speech is not as strictly persuasive as in Oratory, but can be designed to inform. Speeches are typically six to eight minutes long. After-dinner speaking / Speech to entertain  After-dinner speaking or speech to entertain is a public-address event which makes greater sense of a topic with humor. Although it can take the form of any of the accepted public- speaking structures, it often takes the form of an informative or persuasive speech. The event covers a variety of topics, but the use of humor is central to its execution. The speech should not resort to base humor, but should be topical and relevant to the idea presented. This type of speech, found at the collegiate level, is typically six to ten minutes long. Generally, it is a humorous speech with a serious undertone or point. Limited-preparation events  A limited-preparation event is an event in which the speakers have no prior knowledge of the speech they will give, with a set amount of preparation time to write a short speech. Preparation times vary by event and range from two minutes to an hour, after which the competitors deliver their speeches.  Broadcasting  P. E. Svinhufvud, the President of Finland, giving a radio speech in honour of the 10th anniversary of the Finnish Broadcasting Company in 1936. A radio speech is a prepared event which includes news stories and a commercial. Speakers receive a packet with a prepared newscast and must edit and compile these stories into a five-minute newscast that is unique and engaging. Preparation time varies by state from 15 to 45 minutes. Transitions are expected to be smooth, and the newscast should be as close as possible to five minutes. Scoring is based on reading clarity, adherence to the time limit, and the appeal of the stories chosen.  Extemporaneous speaking  Extemporaneous speaking is a speech given with little preparation and without access to the internet for citation. At the beginning of a round, speakers are usually given three questions relating to current events and asked to choose one on which to prepare a speech. During the preparation period (usually thirty minutes), periodicals may be used to prepare the speech. The speech, presented with limited notes, is six to eight minutes long on the collegiate circuit. The main purpose of the speech to make an argument answering the question given at the beginning of the round and convince the audience that this interpretation is the most correct. Although some high-school competitions divide extemporaneous speaking into domestic and international categories, few collegiate competitions do so.  Impromptu speaking  In impromptu speaking, competitors are given a topic (usually a word or phrase which may be a person, thing, a well-known saying, a less well- known quotation, a current event, or an object) and compose a speech based on the prompt. Impromptu speeches are usually four to six minutes long (with 15 seconds to seven minutes of preparation time), but other tournaments have no limits on preparation time or speech length. Judging typically focuses on speaking ability (such as enunciation, pace, and vocal variety), creativity, and overall balance of the speech (such as points of roughly-equal length and appropriate length of introduction and conclusion). In many states, impromptu speaking is a contest combining wit and humor with insight; speeches should be funny, but also make a point.  Extemporaneous commentary  Competitors in extemporaneous commentary are given a topic of national, regional or local importance, and prepare a speech on that topic during a preparation period. Judging focuses on the quality of the vocal presentation, the organization of the speech and the use of sources to back up assertions. The speech is usually presented seated. According to the National Forensic League, the event imitates the work of media commentators who speak about trends or community problems.http://www.nflonline.org/Rostrum/SupplementalConsolation  Extemporaneous programmed reading  Extemporaneous programmed reading is a high-school tournament event in North Dakota. It is more similar to interpretation than limited-preparation events, since each round is an interpretation; however, it differs in that each competitor receives the piece for each round in a one-hour draw and read and cut the piece for interpretation. Three kinds of interpretation are represented in different rounds, one of which is used for the finals: humorous, serious, and poetry. Each competitor has seven minutes to deliver the cut interpretation before the judge.  Storytelling  In storytelling, a high-school event, competitors are given a children's book, fairy tale, fable, myth, legend, or ghost story to read. They have a half-hour to read the given piece and recast it in their own words before presenting their version to the judge in under eight minutes. Stage make-up, costumes, and props are prohibited. Different voices and characters are used, and each character should be easily distinguished.  Apologetics  In this NCFCA and Stoa USA event, competitors are given four minutes to prepare a six-minute speech on a question relating to Christianity. The questions are published online in advance, and the rules are generally the same as for impromptu speaking.  Acting and interpretation events  Though the purpose of each event differs based on if it is an acting event or an interpretation event, all of these events seek to use different forms of literature to tell a certain theme or story.  Dramatic Interpretation  In Dramatic Interpretation, a competitor interprets a selection from a dramatic theatrical script. A competitor plays several parts, which are differentiated with a variety of positions and voices. Each character should be clearly distinguishable, and a competitor can also play a single character. The use of a manuscript depends on the individual tournament and circuit, though typically it is required at the college level and not allowed at the high school level.  Humorous Interpretation  In Humorous Interpretation (shortened to HI or humorous), the humorous alternative to DI at the high- school level, a competitor performs an eight- to ten-minute selection from a humorous literary work. Much of the rules for HI are identical to its dramatic counterpart with the only difference being that the presentation is funny.  Original comedy  Original comedy is an entirely original event in which competitors write a comic story, the structure of which is entirely up to them. The story often involves a main character and several different side characters which the competitor will \\"pop\\" in and out of quickly. No introduction is required and no props or manuscript are allowed. This is a high school event with a time limit of 8 minutes.  Serious interpretation  Serious interpretation, a high-school event, is open to any literary work.  Duo Interpretation  Similar to DI and HI, Duo Interpretation pieces have at least two parts performed by two people. In the collegiate level of this event, the presenters are not allowed to make physical or eye contact or use props, can only touch the ground with their feet. There are no props, costumes, or visual aids allowed however in the collegiate circuit a manuscript is often used The body of work can be from one literary source.  Duet acting  Differing from the college Duo Interpretation, in high school there are two events of duet acting called humorous duet acting and dramatic duet acting. Despite addressing slightly different themes of humor and drama, both events have similar rules. A cutting from only one script is used and though there are still no costumes or visual aids, most tournaments allow for the use of one table and two chairs provided by the tournament. The use of a manuscript is typically not allowed. Differing from the college version, participants are allowed to look and touch their duet partners.  Prose interpretation  Prose interpretation is the interpretation of a single or multiple works of prose. In many styles of competition, since competitors interpret the literature with facial expression and eye contact, memorization is helpful; however, points may be deducted if a speech is too memorized and the competitor does not appear to be reading. However in many other styles of competition, such as the MSHSL, memorization is actually encouraged. In college forensics the maximum time allowed is 10 minutes, including an introduction.  Poetry interpretation  Poetry interpretation is the interpretation of a single or multiple works of poetry centered around a single literary theme. The poetry used can have traditional poetic meter though it is not required. The separate pieces are cut together into a single program that lasts a maximum of 10 minutes, on the college level, with an introduction  Program Oral Interpretation  Program Oral Interpretation is an event all about intertextuality‚Äîthis specific event differs from the rest because it focuses on the interrelationship between works of literature. Through the medium of performance, we take what constitutes a text to be almost anything when recorded somehow. Unlike other categories in the Speech and Debate medium, this means you can use anything that is considered text throughout your program to construct a cohesive story. That specifically allows prose, poetry and drama. Program Oral Interpretation means going above and beyond the usual places to find literature and reading anything for all intents and purposes. The intention of Program Oral Interpretation is to seek and demonstrate how different texts relate and speak to one another as if they were having a conversation for the first time. All texts chosen should inevitably be related upon on cohesive topic. Documentaries, spoken word pieces, statistics, news reports, memoirs, and almost anything else, speak to one another through your arrangement to form a cohesive argument. The core of this event is to focus on the argumentation and have the text be a catapult to drive your argumentation. This event is offered at the college level as well as in some high school regions.  Individual-events tournaments  Individual-events tournaments usually last for six to twelve hours to complete, with the longest tournaments lasting several days. Tournaments have preliminary rounds, followed by possible semifinal and final round for each event. A speech round consists of performances by five to eight competitors, who are then ranked by a judge. Competitors from the same school usually do not compete against each other in preliminary rounds, and are identified by an alphanumeric code to prevent bias by judges. In a round, a competitor earns points for themselves and their team according to their ranking by a judge. The top competitors from each team in each event score points. At the awards ceremony, medals or trophies are given to individuals and team awards are given to the teams with the most points.

Following the end of his term as president, Adamkus remained involved in international development, and is a member of the European Academy of Diplomacy.  Biography  Valdas Adamkus was born on 3 November 1926 into a Roman Catholic family in Kaunas. He was originally given the name \\"Voldemaras Adamkaviƒçius\\" but had it changed to \\"Valdas Adamkus\\" in 1955. His father was one of the first heads of the Lithuanian Air Force School in the Republic of Lithuania. As a young man, Adamkus joined the underground against the first Soviet occupation of 1940. During World War II, his family fled Lithuania in order to avoid the second Soviet occupation in 1944. His uncle was Edvardas Adamkaviƒçius, who was the general in Lithuanian Armed Forces during the interwar period. He attended the University of Munich in Germany before emigrating to the United States in 1949. Fluent in five languages ‚Äî Lithuanian, Polish, English, Russian, and German ‚Äî he served as a senior non- commissioned officer with the United States 5th Army Reserve's military intelligence unit in the 1950s. During his youth, Adamkus was interested in track and field. He also set the national record for running 100 meters. In 1951, Adamkus married Alma Nutautaite. However, they have no children. After arriving in Chicago, Illinois as a displaced person, he first worked in an automobile factory and later as a draftsman. Adamkus graduated as a civil engineer from Illinois Institute of Technology in 1961. While a student, Adamkus, together with other Lithuanian Americans, collected about 40,000 signatures petitioning the United States government to intervene in the ongoing deportations of Lithuanians to Siberia by the Soviets. The petition was presented to then-Vice President Richard Nixon. Adamkus also raised concerns about other Soviet activities in occupied Lithuania to United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld in 1958, and to President John F. Kennedy in 1962.  Career in the United States Environmental Protection Agency  He joined the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at its inception in 1970, working in Cincinnati. In 1981, he was appointed regional administrator by President Ronald Reagan, and was responsible for all air, water, hazardous waste, and other pollution control programs in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. In 1985, President Reagan presented him with the Distinguished Executive Presidential Rank Awardthe highest honor that can be bestowed upon a civil servant. In 1972, Adamkus visited Lithuania for the first time in almost thirty years. He was a member of the official delegation from the United States attending an environmental conference in Moscow. As perestroika took root in the Soviet Union, Adamkus's visits to his homeland became more frequent. Valdas Adamkus served as regional administrator of the EPA for sixteen years, and retired in 1997, after twenty- nine years of service. Upon his retirement, he received a congratulatory letter from President Clinton and a Distinguished Career Award from EPA Administrator Carol Browner. EPA Region 5 presented him with the newly established \\"Valdas V. Adamkus Sustained Commitment to the Environment Honor Award\\".  Lithuanian presidency, 1998‚Äì2003  Shortly after leaving the EPA, Valdas Adamkus moved back to Lithuania. Soon after his decision to run for presidency in 1998, he faced a legal battle in the Lithuanian courts. Doubts arose whether Adamkus was eligible to run for presidency due to having spent over half a century abroad, raising the possibility that he might not meet minimum residency requirements. However, the court resolved the case in Adamkus' favor, and no other obstacles remained other than his U.S. citizenship, which he officially renounced at the American Embassy in Vilnius. He was elected as President of Lithuania in 1998, defeating Art≈´ras Paulauskas in the runoff, serving from then until 2003, when he ran for re-election, but was unexpectedly defeated by Rolandas Paksas. He returned to politics after the presidential scandal of 2003 and 2004, when his former rival Paksas was impeached and removed from office. In the first round of the 2004 election, held on 13 June 2004, Adamkus securing 30% of the vote ‚Äì more than any other candidate. Paksas could not run for office again, because a ruling from Lithuania's Constitutional Court disallowed him from running for public office and he was, therefore, unable to register as a candidate. A runoff election was held on 27 June 2004, which Adamkus won with about 52% of the votes against Kazimira Prunskienƒó. By 2009 he had served the two presidential terms permitted by the Constitution of Lithuania and was succeeded as president by Dalia Grybauskaite. In 2003 Valdas Adamkus was named UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for the Construction of Knowledge Societies. The Director-General of UNESCO, Ko√Øchiro Matsuura, noted that Adamkus was named as Ambassador \\"in recognition of his dedication to the Organization's aims and ideals and with a view to benefiting for the construction of knowledge societies from his wisdom and extensive experience in many of UNESCO's areas of concern, in particular promotion of social development, cultural diversity, dialog and international cooperation.\\"Roni Amelan, Valdas Adamkus to be named UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for the Knowledge Societies, Bureau of Public Information, UNESCO. Accessed 7 September 2006.  Lithuanian presidency, 2004‚Äì2009  Foreign affairs Under the presidency of Valdas Adamkus, Lithuania actively promoted democracy in the formerly Soviet Eastern European and Asian nations. President Adamkus, together with President Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski, Javier Solana, Boris Gryzlov and J√°n Kubi≈°, served as a mediator during Ukraine's political crisis, when two candidates in the 2004 presidential election, Viktor Yanukovych and Viktor Yushchenko, each claimed victory. President Adamkus recalled in an interview that \\"when I asked what we could do to help, Kuchma said the friends of the Ukrainian people should drop whatever they were doing and come to Kiev immediately.\\".Steven Paulikas, A House Divided, Newsweek, 24 January 2006. Accessed 7 September 2006. The next day international mediators met in Ukraine. The crisis was resolved after a new election was held. Valdas Adamkus and his Estonian counterpart Arnold R√º√ºtel rejected an invitation to participate in a commemorative celebration of the end of World War II in Europe in 2005. President Adamkus expressed the view that the war's end, in Lithuania, marked the beginning of a fifty-year Soviet occupation and repression. In response, on 22 July, the United States Congress unanimously passed a resolution that Russia should \\"issue a clear and unambiguous statement of admission and condemnation of the illegal occupation and annexation by the Soviet Union from 1940 to 1991 of the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania\\",http://jbanc.org/old/hres128.html but Russia refused. President Adamkus supports an active dialog between European Union member states and former Soviet republics such as Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova, that are actively seeking membership in the EU. He expressed support for these candidate members during the Community of Democratic Choice in 2005, at the Vilnius Conference 2006, and on several other occasions. Valdas Adamkus is an Honorary Member of The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation. Domestic affairs Valdas Adamkus enjoyed a very high approval rating in Lithuania. He was also recognized for the second time for his support of Lithuanian youth. President Adamkus was actively involved in government reorganizations in 2004 and 2006.

When the Soviet Union presented an ultimatum to Lithuania demanding that it accept a Soviet garrison, President Antanas Smetona fled the country leaving Merkys as acting president. Merkys ostensibly cooperated with the Soviets, and illegally took over the presidency in his own right. After three days, Merkys handed power to Justas Paleckis, who formed the People's Government of Lithuania. When Merkys attempted to flee the country, he was captured and deported to the interior of Russia, where he died in 1955. Biography A. Merkys in 1921 Merkys was born at Bajorai, near Skapi≈°kis. Educated in law, he served in the Russian Army during World War I (1914‚Äì18). In 1919, he served as the newly independent Lithuania's Minister of Defence before serving with the Lithuanian Army until his decommissioning in 1922. He then practised as a lawyer. After the Klaipƒóda Revolt of 1923, Merkys became secretary to the Klaipƒóda Region Commissioner, Antanas Smetona. Following the 1926 Lithuanian coup d'√©tat, he became Minister of Defence again until 1927, when he was made Governor of Klaipƒóda Region. In 1932, German demands prompted his removal as Governor and Merkys returned to practising law. He became Mayor of Kaunas in 1933 and served in this position until 1939. In 1936 was elected to the Fourth Seimas of Lithuania. On 17 November 1939 he became Prime Minister. Soviet ultimatum and occupation When, on 14 June 1940, the Soviet Union presented an ultimatum to Lithuania, Smetona proposed armed resistance. Merkys suggested accepting the ultimatum and offered to resign as Prime Minister, but he temporarily remained in office. Merkys agreed to Soviet demands that Smetona be arrested, but was unsuccessful in doing so. Rather than accept the demands, Smetona fled to Germany and then to Switzerland. Before leaving the country, he symbolically turned over his presidential duties to Merkys. Under the Constitution of 1938, the prime minister served as acting president whenever the president was unable to carry out his duties. The day after Smetona's departure, Merkys announced on national radio that he had removed Smetona and was now president in his own right. This violated the Lithuanian constitution, since Smetona never formally resigned. As such, Merkys is not recognized as a legitimate president in Lithuanian government records. On 17 June 1940 Merkys acceded to more Soviet demandsa) dispatch police to arrest Skuƒças and Povilaitis near the Lithuanian border Wiki Kazys Skucas and b) appointing Justas Paleckis as the new Prime Minister. Merkys resigned later that day, making Paleckis acting president as well. The Soviets then used Paleckis as a puppet to provide the ostensibly legal sanction for its annexation of Lithuania a month later. When Lithuania declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, it took the line that since Merkys' seizure of the presidency was illegal, all actions leading up to Lithuania's annexation by the Soviet Union later that year were ipso facto void. Therefore, Lithuania contended that it did not need to follow the secession process outlined in the Soviet Constitution, since it was reasserting an independence that still existed under international law. A month later Merkys attempted to escape to Sweden, but was arrested in Riga. He and his family were deported to Saratov in Russia. In 1941 Merkys was imprisoned. In 1954, during the period of de- Stalinization, Merkys was released from prison, but not allowed to return to Lithuania. He lived in Vladimir until his death the following year, on 5 March 1955. Subsequently, his grave could not be located, but a symbolic cenotaph dedicated to Merkys' memory is in the Petra≈°i≈´nai Cemetery in Kaunas.

He was nominal acting president of Lithuania after the Soviet invasion while Lithuania was still ostensibly independent, in office from 17 June to 3 August 1940. He then remained as the nominal head of state of the Lithuanian SSR until 1967. Life and career Paleckis was born in Tel≈°iai in 1899. In 1926‚Äì1927, he was a director of the Lithuanian official news agency, ELTA. He later voiced opposition to the ruling elite in Lithuania; in this way, he became a suitable candidate for the Lithuanian communists (manipulated by Soviet envoy Vladimir Dekanozov) to become the puppet leader of Lithuania in the Soviets' planned takeover of the country in 1940. After President Antanas Smetona fled to the US when the Soviet Union occupied the country, Prime Minister Antanas Merkys became acting president. A day after Smetona left the country, Merkys announced he had formally ousted Smetona and taken over the presidency himself. He then appointed Paleckis prime minister. Merkys himself resigned, making Paleckis acting president as well. These moves are now considered illegal and unconstitutional, since Smetona never resigned. As such, Lithuanian government records do not recognize Paleckis as a legitimate president. By this time, Lithuania had been occupied by Soviet troops. Paleckis' appointment as Prime Minister was made under orders form the Soviet embassy in Kaunas. Aided by specialists sent in from Moscow, Soviet deputy foreign minister Vladimir Dekanozov worked through the Lithuanian Communist Party, while the cabinet of ministers, headed by Paleckis, served an administrative function. Dekanozov and Paleckis brought a number of non- Communists into the first \\"People's government\\", but in historical retrospect it is clear that they constituted window dressing for the Soviet takeover. In order to save face, the Soviet Union attempted to cover its annexation of the Baltic States with a cloak of legality. Therefore, Moscow ordered the Paleckis government to carry out elections for a \\"People's Seimas\\" on 14‚Äì15 July. Voters were presented with a single list of candidates containing only Communists and their allies. When the People's Seimas met on 21 July, it had only one order of business‚Äîa resolution declaring Lithuania a Soviet republic and requesting admission to the Soviet Union, which was unanimously carried. A few days later, Moscow \\"accepted\\" the request‚Äîthus giving credence to the official line that Lithuania had carried out a socialist revolution independent of Moscow's influence and requested admission to the Soviet Union. Lithuania's official position since 1990 has been that since Smetona never resigned, all acts leading up to the Soviet annexation were ipso facto void. Paleckis remained as head of state, a post which was named Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR, until 1967. As such, he personally signed orders authorizing the mass deportation of several figures from independent Lithuania. With his agreement, Merkys and Minister of Foreign Affairs Juozas Urb≈°ys were deported to the Russian SFSR. The intelligentsia and Lithuania's elite were considered as enemies and were among the first sentenced to deportation or death. He worked closely with NKVD residents in Lithuania (M. Gedvilas, M. Mickis). Paleckis signed documents and, as a representative of Soviet Russia, took responsibility for the deportations. During 1940‚Äì1953, some 132,000 Lithuanians were deported to remote areas of the USSR: Siberia, the Arctic Circle zone and Central Asia. More than 70% of the deportees were women and children. During the same period, another 200,000 people were thrown into prisons. Some 150,000 of them were sent to the Gulag (Soviet labor camps), situated mostly in Siberia.

Few represented the U.S. state of Georgia at the Constitutional Convention and signed the U.S. Constitution. Few and James Gunn were the first Senators from Georgia. Born into a poor yeoman farming family, William Few achieved both social prominence and political power later in life. Exhibiting those characteristics of self-reliance vital for survival on the American frontier, he became an intimate of the nation's political and military elite. The idea of a rude frontiersman providing the democratic leaven within an association of the rich and powerful has always excited the American imagination, nurtured on stories of Davy Crockett. In the case of the self-educated Few, that image was largely accurate. Few's inherent gifts for leadership and organization, as well as his sense of public service, were brought out by his experience in the American Revolutionary War. Important in any theater of military operations, leadership and organizational ability were particularly needed in the campaigns in the south where a dangerous and protracted struggle against a determined British invader intimately touched the lives of many settlers. Few's dedication to the common good and his natural military acumen quickly brought him to the attention of the leaders of the Patriot cause, who eventually invested him with important political responsibilities as well. The war also profoundly affected Few's attitude toward the political future of the new nation, transforming the rugged frontier individualist into a forceful exponent of a permanent union of the states. Men of his stripe came to realize during the years of military conflict that the rights of the individual, so jealously prized on the frontier, could be nurtured and protected only by a strong central government accountable to the people. This belief became the hallmark of his long public service.  Early history  Descendant of Quaker shoe polisher Richard Few from the county of Wiltshire, England, and his son Isaac Few, a cooper, who emigrated to Pennsylvania in the 1640s, the Few family lived in northern Maryland, where they eked out a modest living raising tobacco on small holdings. When a series of droughts struck the region in the 1750s, the Fews and their neighbors‚Äîactually a sort of extended family consisting of cousins and distant relations‚Äîfound themselves on the brink of ruin. The whole community decided to abandon its farms and try its luck among the more fertile lands on the southern frontier. In time the Few family achieved a measure of prosperity, emerging political leaders in rural Orange County. Like many other western settlers, however, the family became involved with the Regulators, a populist movement that grew up in reaction to the political and economic restrictions imposed on the frontier or back-country farmers by the merchants and planters of the tidewater area and by the local politicians and lawyers. By 1771 protest had become confrontation, and a large group of mostly unarmed westerners gathered to clash with North Carolina militia units at the \\"battle\\" of the Alamance. The uneven fight ended in total victory for the militia, although most of the Regulator's demands for political representation and economic relief eventually would be met by the state legislature.

Retrieved July 18, 2013. and the Few family farm just east of Hillsborough was ransacked by Tryon's militia troops. This led to William Few's ambivalence towards capital punishment. The rest of the family fled to Wrightsboro, Georgia leaving William behind to settle the family's affairs and sell their property.William Few Jr. \\"Founding Father of America\\" from Georgia. fewgenealogy.net. Retrieved July 18, 2013. These antagonisms within North Carolina began to evaporate as American opinion turned against the imperial measures instituted by Great Britain in the 1770s. Both the eastern planters and the new settlers found new taxes and restrictions on western expansion at odds with their idea of self- government, and Patriot leaders were able to unite the state against what they could portray as a threat to the liberties of all parties. Few participated in this training as one of the first men to enlist in the volunteer militia or \\"minute men\\" company formed in Hillsborough. Typically, Few's unit received its tactical instruction from a veteran of the colonial wars, in this case a former corporal in the British Army who was hired by the company as its drill sergeant. Citing the press of family business, Few rejected the offer of a captaincy in one of the first units North Carolina raised for the Continental Army in the summer of 1775. But when he finally settled the family's accounts the next year and joined his relatives in Georgia, where he opened a law office, he quickly placed his newly acquired military knowledge at the service of the Patriot cause in his new state  Revolutionary War  Georgia organized its citizen-soldiers on a geographical basis, forming local companies into a regiment in each county. Few joined the Richmond County Regiment, which his older brother, Benjamin, commanded. For the next two years Few's military duties consisted of attending military assemblies where he instructed his friends and neighbors in the skills he had acquired in the North Carolina militia. Only in 1778, when Georgia faced the threat of invasion by a force of Loyalist militia and British regulars based in Florida, was Few finally called to active duty. The Georgians' first military campaign ended in disaster. A force of state and Continental units successfully combined to repulse an enemy raid on Sunbury near the states southeastern border, but a counterattack orchestrated by Major General Robert Howe of the Continental Army and Governor John Houstoun bogged down before the Patriots could reach St. Augustine. Few, now in command of a company of Georgia Militia, watched the collapse of the campaign's logistical support and then the disintegration of the force itself, as senior officers bickered among themselves and as disease began to decimate the units. Only half of the American soldiers survived to return home. At the end of the year a sudden amphibious invasion by British forces resulted in the capture of Savannah, Georgia, and the destruction of the rest of the Continental units under Howe and most of the eastern militia formations. Armed resistance to the British continued in the western part of the state, led by the Richmond County Regiment. Throughout 1779 the regiment, with Few now second in command, frequently turned out to skirmish with probing British units, eventually forcing the enemy to abandon Augusta, which the British had captured soon after the fall of Savannah. The success of the citizen-soldiers in defending their own homes began to reverse the fortunes of war in Georgia, prompting the new Continental commander in the region, Major General Benjamin Lincoln, to take the offensive. Lincoln combined his continentals and militia units from Georgia and South Carolina with a French force newly arrived from the Caribbean to lay siege to Savannah. He immediately encountered difficulty, however, in coordinating the efforts of his diverse forces. The French, under pressure to terminate operations quickly in order to move on to other assignments, persuaded Lincoln to launch a full frontal attack. The result was a bloody defeat, but Few's militiamen participated in a successful rear-guard action that shielded the retreat of the American units. In the aftermath of the battle his regiment was posted to the frontier where the Creek Indians, interpreting the defeat before Savannah as proof of the Georgians' weakness, had taken to the field in support of British forces. Enemy operations in Georgia in 1779 were part of a new \\"southern strategy\\" by which the British planned to use the state as a base for conquering the rebellious colonies in a sweep up from the south. Few's military service in the later years of the war proved critical both in frustrating this strategy and in enhancing his credentials as a state leader. The western forces, in which Few's regiment played a prominent role, kept the British from consolidating their position. The area never developed into a secure Loyalist base, and British troops needed for subsequent operations against the Carolinas and Virginia had to be diverted to counter the threat posed by the frontier militia units. Few emerged as a gifted administrator and logistics expert in this demanding and difficult effort to maintain a viable military force in Georgia. He also turned into a bold, innovative partisan commander. Experience and innate common sense enabled him to develop patience, preserve his forces for key attacks, and then pick his time and place to defeat small enemy parties without unduly risking the safety of his men. Most important, he displayed the raw physical stamina required to survive the serious hardships of guerrilla warfare.  Statesman  Few's signature on early American currency from Georgia (1778). Bust of Few at the Washington-Wilkes Historical Museum Military was a success that went hand in hand with political service. During the late 1770s Few also won election to the House of Representatives in the Georgia General Assembly, sat on the state's Executive Council, acted as state surveyor-general, represented Georgia in negotiations with the Indians that succeeded in minimizing the danger of frontier attacks, and served as Richmond County's senior magistrate. Few's growing political prominence and undisputed talent for leadership prompted the state legislature in 1780 to appoint him to represent Georgia in the Continental Congress, which became the Congress of the Confederation after the ratification of the Articles of Confederation a year later.A Biography of William Few 1748‚Äì1828. rug.nl. Retrieved July 18, 2013. Few served in Congress less than a year when, in the wake of General Nathanael Greene's successful effort to drive the British out of most of Georgia, Congress sent him home to help reassemble Georgia's scattered government. This task accomplished, Few returned to Congress in 1782, where he remained to serve throughout most of the decade. While a member of that body, Few was asked by his state to serve concurrently in the Constitutional Convention that met in Philadelphia in 1787. This dual responsibility caused him to split his time between the two bodies and therefore to miss portions of the constitutional proceedings. Nevertheless, Few firmly supported the effort to create a strong national government and worked hard to secure the Continental Congress' approval of the new instrument of government. He also participated in the Georgia convention in 1788 that ratified the document. Georgia promptly selected Few to serve as one of its original United States senators. In the Senate, Few opposed the creation of the First Bank of the United States. Planning to retire from politics at the expiration of his term in 1793, he bowed instead to the wishes of his neighbors and served yet another term in the state legislature. In 1796 Few was appointed as a federal judge for the Georgia circuit.William Few Writings and Biography. lexrex.com. Retrieved July 18, 2013. During this three-year appointment he not only consolidated his reputation as a practical, fair jurist but became a prominent supporter of public education. He was a founding trustee of the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens in 1785. Few's efforts to establish UGA as the first state-chartered university in the United States indicated the importance this self-educated man gave to formal instruction. He was an outspoken opponent of the infamous Yazoo land fraud, though his political enemies tried to implicate him in this scam. At the urging of his wife, a native New Yorker, Few left Georgia in 1799 and moved to Manhattan. There, he embarked on yet another career of public service, while supporting his family through banking and the occasional practice of law. He served as President of the City Bank of New York, the predecessor of present-day Citigroup, after Samuel Osgood died in August 1813. He stayed in this position until 1817, when Peter Stagg became president. Few's new neighbors promptly elected him to represent them in the New York State Assembly from 1802‚Äì05 and later as a city alderman from 1813‚Äì14. He also served as New York's inspector of prisons 1802‚Äì10 and as the United States Commissioner of Loans in 1804.

Alleged abduction On the evening of October 11, 1973, 42-year-old Charles Hickson and 19-year-old Calvin Parker told the Jackson County, Mississippi Sheriff's office they were fishing off a pier on the west bank of the Pascagoula River in Mississippi when they heard a whirring/whizzing sound, saw two flashing blue lights, and observed an oval shaped object 30‚Äì40 feet across and 8‚Äì10 feet high. Parker and Hickson claimed they were \\"conscious but paralyzed\\" while three \\"creatures\\" with \\"robotic slit-mouths\\" and \\"crab-like pincers\\" took them aboard the object and subjected them to an examination. Publicity and Later Activities Following the incident, Hickson gave interviews and lectures, appeared on television (including an episode of the game show To Tell The Truth),To Tell the Truth, episode taped November 20th, 1973 in 1974 claimed additional encounters with aliens, and in 1983 authored a self-published book UFO Contact at Pascagoula. Parker later attended UFO conventions, and in 1993 started a company called \\"UFO Investigations\\" to produce television stories about UFOs. Skepticism Aviation journalist and UFO skeptic Philip J. Klass found \\"discrepancies\\" in Hickson's story, noted that Hickson refused to take a polygraph exam conducted by an experienced examiner, and concluded that the case was a hoax. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell wrote that Hickson's behavior was \\"questionable\\" and that Hickson later altered or embellished his claims. Nickell speculated that Hickson may have fantasized the alien encounter during a hypnagogic \\"waking dream state\\", and suggested that Parker's corroboration of the tale was likely due to suggestibility because he initially told police he had \\"passed out at the beginning of the incident and failed to regain consciousness until it was over\\", a claim supported by Hickson during his To Tell The Truth appearance.

He was a Labor member of the Australian House of Representatives from March 1990 to October 2004, representing the Division of Kingsford Smith, New South Wales. He is credited with building Sydney's controversial monorail. Early life Brereton was born in the Sydney suburb of Kensington, and was educated at De La Salle Catholic College, Coogee, now defunct. He was apprenticed and worked as an electrical tradesman to the Sydney County Council, a former council-owned retailer of electricity in inner Sydney. Political career New South Wales politics He survived the political controversy of the Botany Council affair in the mid-'70s when he was accused of attempting to influence ALP aldermen who were considering an application to rezone a block of land. He and Geoffrey Cahill, then Labor's NSW general secretary (and son of former Premier Joseph Cahill), appeared in court on bribery and conspiracy charges but after 17 days of hearings and evidence from high-powered witnesses, including Rupert Murdoch, all charges were thrown out. Brereton served in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as member for Randwick 1970‚Äì71 and Heffron 1973‚Äì90. In the governments led by Neville Wran and (from 1986) Barrie Unsworth, Brereton was Minister for Health 1981‚Äì84, Minister for Roads 1983‚Äì84 and 1984‚Äì87, Minister for Public Works 1984‚Äì87 and Minister for Employment 1984. He was instrumental in allowing the monorail in Sydney to be built, and opposed the development of a light rail project. Federal politics Upon switching to the federal Parliament, Brereton was Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister 1991‚Äì93, Minister for Industrial Relations 1993‚Äì96, Minister for Transport 1993‚Äì96, and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters 1993. In March 1996 the ALP government lost office to John Howard. Brereton was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry 1996‚Äì2001 serving as Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs. Assisted by his adviser, Dr Philip Dorling, Brereton was instrumental in revising Federal Labor policy to support self-determination and independence for East Timor. Brereton was a vocal critic of Howard, who supported East Timor's continued integration in Indonesia. He was also strongly critical of the performance of past Labor Governments, in particular Prime Minister Gough Whitlam who acquiesced to Indonesia's intentions to invade East Timor in 1975. During 1998 and 1999 Brereton highlighted evidence of the Indonesian military's involvement in pro-integrationist violence in East Timor and was a strident advocate of United Nations peacekeeping to support East Timor's independence ballot. Brereton was a member of the Australian Parliamentary observer mission that witnessed the conduct of the ballot. Brereton's break from previous Australian bipartisanship on East Timor policy was an important factor in the Howard Government's eventual decision to change Australian policy and intervene in East Timor in September 1999. According to historian and former Australian Army officer Clinton Fernandes, \\"The ALP's change of policy ‚Äì and the resulting pressure of the [Australian] Government ‚Äì was a critical factor in the independence of East Timor.\\" Brereton's activism on the East Timor issue was strongly opposed by senior Labor political figures, notably Whitlam and former Foreign Minister Gareth Evans and found little support from Federal Labor leader Kim Beazley. However Beazley was reluctant to challenge Brereton's handling of the issue and eventually accepted the change in Labor policy. Following controversy in 1999 over leaked Australian intelligence reports relating to East Timor and the Indonesian military, Australian Federal Police and Defence Security agents raided Dr Dorling's home in September 2000, but no classified material was found. Taking into account his service in the New South Wales Parliament, Brereton had the longest period of parliamentary service of any member of the Parliament elected in 2001. In June 2004 he announced his retirement from politics at the 2004 federal election. He helped engineer the candidacy of the rock singer Peter Garrett as his successor in the seat. His wife, Justice Tricia Kavanagh, sits on the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales. They have two sons. Brereton is the younger brother of Deirdre Grusovin.

He represented the Liberal Party in the House of Representatives (1996‚Äì2007, 2013‚Äì2016) and held ministerial office in the Howard and Turnbull Governments. Brough was born in Brisbane and was an Australian Army officer and businessman before entering politics. He was first elected to parliament at the 1996 federal election, representing the Queensland seat of Longman. He was made a parliamentary secretary in 2000 and subsequently served as Minister for Employment Services (2001‚Äì2004) and Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer (2004‚Äì2006). Brough was promoted to cabinet in 2006 as Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, and subsequently oversaw the controversial Northern Territory Emergency Response. He lost his seat at the 2007 election, at which the government was defeated. As state president of the Liberals, Brough opposed the merger which led to the creation of the Liberal National Party of Queensland in 2008. He returned to federal parliament in 2013, standing in the seat of Fisher. In September 2015 Brough was reappointed to the ministry by Malcolm Turnbull, who replaced Tony Abbott as Liberal leader and prime minister. However, his second stint as a minister lasted only until December 2015, as he resigned from the ministry following revelations that the Australian Federal Police had investigated him over his dealings with James Ashby. In February 2016 he announced that he would not seek preselection for the seat of Fisher at the 2016 federal election. Early life Brough was born on 29 December 1961 in Brisbane, Queensland. He served in the Australian Army from 1979 to 1987 and subsequently worked in the private sector. His brother Rob Brough is a Seven News presenter and former host of Family Feud. Brough has Indigenous Australian ancestry through his maternal grandmother Violet Bowden, whose father was Aboriginal.\\"Don't know for sure, no real way of ascertaining it\\" - Brough in His sister, Carol Stubbs, has served on the board of several Aboriginal corporations.https://www.crikey.com.au/2006/01/31/does-mal-brough-have-a- conflict-of-interest/ Political career Brough was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business 2000‚Äì01 and Minister for Employment Services from 2001 to 2004. In July 2004 he was moved to the portfolios of Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue. He was Minister for Families and Community Services and Indigenous Affairs from January 2006 to November 2007. In his Indigenous Affairs portfolio, Brough was the chief architect of the government's Northern Territory Emergency Response, a package of measures designed to combat alleged high rates of child neglect and abuse in the territory. Brough was one of a number of government MPs including John Howard who lost their seats at the 2007 election. Brough suffered a swing of 10.3 points in the two-party-preferred vote in his seat, to finish with a vote of 46.4 percent. He was succeeded by Labor's Jon Sullivan. Brough switched to the seat of Fisher and won it back from Liberal turned independent and the Speaker of the House of Representatives Peter Slipper at the 2013 federal election. State politics Brough was elected as the President of the Queensland division of the Liberal Party in May 2008. He remained in that position after a vote in July 2008 to merge into the new Liberal National Party of Queensland (LNP). He opposed the merger as it had not received final ratification from the federal Liberal Party. On 26 September 2008 he resigned from his post, saying: \\"You try and do the right thing and, quite frankly, at this point it's all over the shop and it's no wonder voters get so disenchanted with the non-Labor side of politics.\\" It was because of his opposition of the merger to the LNP that he was not a candidate for his former seat of Longman at the 2010 federal election. That would have meant securing preselection from the LNP in order to have a good chance of reclaiming the seat. He also criticised the party leading up to the 2010 election on its absence of policies, but he did not rule out running for his resident seat of Fisher against Peter Slipper, a National party member who had joined the Liberals. Federal politics and diary allegations In 2006, Brough was the Minister for Families and Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Faced with allegations regarding the degradation of Aboriginal communities and frequent cases of child sexual abuse, Brough, combined with the Northern Territory Chief Minister Clare Martin, commissioned a report into child sexual abuse in the Northern Territory. This report received much criticism, beginning with the view that it was a hasty reaction to these allegations. Researchers have suggested that the report was not simply used as an opportunity to resolve these issues, but rather as another way to control these communities. In mid-2012, following the defection of Peter Slipper from the Liberals to become an independent MP and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Brough announced that he was seeking LNP preselection for the seat of Fisher for the 2013 federal election. On 29 July 2012, it was announced that had won the preselection for the seat, despite criticism over his contact with James Ashby. Ashby had been an adviser to Slipper who had made accusation of sexual harassment. Justice Steve Rares found that Brough had acted with Ashby and another Slipper staffer, Karen Doane, in abusing the judicial process for the \\"purpose of causing significant public, reputational and political damage to Mr Slipper\\". On 9 October 2012, Slipper resigned as Speaker following revelations of mobile phone text messages he had sent to Ashby. In an early 2014 appeal ruling the full bench of the Federal Court found that Justice Rares had 'no basis to conclude that Brough was part of any combination with anyone in respect to the commencement of these proceedings with the predominant purpose of damaging Slipper in the way alleged or at all,' and that there was 'nothing untoward about those matters'.The majority judgment of the Full Federal Court stated that there was insufficient evidence to support the finding of Rares J at trial: . On 29 December 2015 Brough stood down from the Turnbull Ministry and moved to the backbench pending the completion of an investigation by the Australian Federal Police over the alleged copying of the diary of former speaker Peter Slipper. Jamie Briggs also resigned on the same day. Questions were raised over the holiday timing of the announcements. On 13 February 2016, Brough resigned from the Ministry. On 26 February he announced that he would not recontest the seat of Fisher, concluding that it was \\"a privilege and an honour\\" to represent the electorate.

Bach. Slow introduction followed by an allegro traditionally taken at double the speed. Sixteenth notes in the old tempo prepare for eighth notes in the new tempo . In music, metric modulation is a change in pulse rate (tempo) and/or pulse grouping (subdivision) which is derived from a note value or grouping heard before the change. Examples of metric modulation may include changes in time signature across an unchanging tempo, but the concept applies more specifically to shifts from one time signature/tempo (metre) to another, wherein a note value from the first is made equivalent to a note value in the second, like a pivot or bridge. The term \\"modulation\\" invokes the analogous and more familiar term in analyses of tonal harmony, wherein a pitch or pitch interval serves as a bridge between two keys. In both terms, the pivoting value functions differently before and after the change, but sounds the same, and acts as an audible common element between them. Metric modulation was first described by Richard Franko while reviewing the Cello Sonata of Elliott Carter, who prefers to call it tempo modulation . Another synonymous term is proportional tempi . Determination of the new tempo The following formula illustrates how to determine the tempo before or after a metric modulation, or, alternatively, how many of the associated note values will be in each measure before or after the modulation: :\\\\frac{\\\\text{new tempo}}{\\\\text{old tempo}} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{number of pivot note values in new measure}}{\\\\text{number of pivot note values in old measure}} : Metric modulation: 2 half notes = 3 half notes. or subdivision for tempo/metre comparison. Thus if the two half notes in time at a tempo of quarter note = 84 are made equivalent with three half notes at a new tempo, that tempo will be: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\qquad \\\\frac{x}{84} & = \\\\frac{3}{2}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ {84} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{x}{84} & = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\cdot {84}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\qquad {x} & = \\\\frac{3 \\\\cdot 84}{2}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\qquad {x} & = {126} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} :(, example taken from Carter's Eight Etudes and a Fantasy for woodwind quartet (1950), Fantasy, mm. 16-17.) Note that this tempo, quarter note = 126, is equal to dotted-quarter note = 84 (( = ) = ( = )). A tempo (or metric) modulation causes a change in the hierarchical relationship between the perceived beat subdivision and all potential subdivisions belonging to the new tempo. has explored some compositional uses of tempo modulations, such as tempo networks and beat subdivision spaces. Three challenges arise when performing metric modulations: #Grouping notes of the same speed differently on each side of the barline, ex: (quintuplet =sextuplet ) with sixteenth notes before and after the barline #Subdivision used on one side of the barline and not the other, ex: (triplet =) with triplets before and quarter notes after the barline #Subdivision used on neither side of the barline but used to establish the modulation, ex: (quintuplet =) with quarter notes before and after the barline : Examples of the use of metric modulation include Carter's Cello Sonata (1948) , A Symphony of Three Orchestras (1976) , and Bj√∂rk's \\"Desired Constellation\\" (=) .  Score notation  Metric modulation marking used to indicate a change to swing rhythm. Metric modulations are generally notated as 'note value' = 'note value'. For example, :File:4-5 Metric Modulation.JPG This notation is also normally followed by the new tempo in parentheses. This is analogous with the assignment in imperative computer languages: \`{x = f(x);} ‚â° {xnew = f(xold);}\` Before the modern concept and notation of metric modulations composers used the terms doppio piu mosso and doppio piu lento for double and half-speed, and later markings such as: :(Adagio)=(Allegro) indicating double speed, which would now be marked (=) . The phrase l'istesso tempo was used for what may now be notated with metric modulation markings. For example: to (), will be marked l'istesso tempo, indicating the beat is the same speed.

Throughout his career, he has performed both as a leader and a sideman in the bands of Walt Dickerson and Cecil Taylor, among others. AllMusic biographer Chris Kelsey wrote: \\"Few free-jazz drummers play with a tenth of Cyrille's grace and authority. His energy is unflagging, his power absolute, tempered only by an ever-present sense of propriety.\\" Life and career Cyrille was born on November 10, 1939, in Brooklyn, New York into a Haitian family. He began studying science at St. John's University, but was already playing jazz in the evenings and switched his studies to the Juilliard School. His first drum teachers were fellow Brooklyn-based drummers Willie Jones and Lenny McBrowne; through them, Cyrille met Max Roach. Nonetheless, Cyrille became a disciple of Philly Joe Jones, who in some performances such as Time Waits used Cyrille's drum kit. His first professional engagement was as an accompanist of singer Nellie Lutcher, and he had an early recording session with Coleman Hawkins. Trumpeter Ted Curson introduced him to pianist Cecil Taylor when Cyrille was 18. He joined the Cecil Taylor unit in 1964, and stayed for about 10 years, eventually performing drum duos with Milford Graves. In addition to recording as a bandleader, he has recorded and/or performed with musicians such as David Murray, Ir√®ne Schweizer, Marilyn Crispell, Carla Bley, Butch Morris and Reggie Workman among others. Cyrille is currently a member of the group, Trio 3, with Oliver Lake and Reggie Workman. Discography As leader * What About?

Graves is noteworthy for his early avant-garde contributions in the 1960s with Paul Bley, Albert Ayler, and the New York Art Quartet, and is considered to be a free jazz pioneer, liberating percussion from its timekeeping role. The composer and saxophonist John Zorn referred to Mr. Graves as \\"basically a 20th-century shaman.\\" Biography Graves began playing drums at age three, and was introduced to the congas at age eight. He also studied timbales and African hand drumming at an early age. By the early 1960s, he was leading dance bands and playing in Latin/Afro Cuban ensembles in New York on bills alongside Cal Tjader and Herbie Mann. His group, the Milford Graves Latino Quintet, included saxophonist Pete Yellin, pianist Chick Corea, bassist Lisle Atkinson, and conga player Bill Fitch. In 1962, Graves heard the John Coltrane quartet with Elvin Jones, whose drumming made a strong impression. The following year, Graves acquired a standard drum set from pianist Hal Galper and began using it regularly. That summer, percussionist Don Alias invited Graves to Boston for a residency, and Graves began playing with saxophonist Giuseppi Logan. In 1964, during a visit to New York, Logan introduced Graves to trombonist Roswell Rudd and saxophonist John Tchicai. Graves \\"wound up playing with them for half an hour, astonishing Rudd and Tchicai, who promptly invited him to join what became The New York Art Quartet.\\" Rudd recalled that Graves's \\"playing was like an anti-gravity vortex, in which you could either float or fly depending on your impulse.\\" According to Tchicai, \\"Graves simply baffled both Rudd and I in that, at that time, we hadn't heard anybody of the younger musicians in New York that had the same sense of rhythmic cohesion in polyrhythms or the same sense of intensity and musicality.\\" Tchicai also stated that Don Moore, the original New York Art Quartet bassist, \\"became so frightened of this wizard of a percussionist that he decided that this couldn't be true or possible and therefore refused to play with us.\\" That same year, Graves also participated in the \\"October Revolution in Jazz\\" organized by Bill Dixon, and appeared on a number of recordings, including the New York Art Quartet's self-titled debut album, Giuseppi Logan's debut album, which also featured pianist Don Pullen and bassist Eddie G√≥mez, Paul Bley's Barrage, Montego Joe's Arriba! Con Montego Joe (which also featured Chick Corea and G√≥mez), and the Jazz Composer's Orchestra's Communication. Graves also briefly played with Albert Ayler's trio, which included bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Sunny Murray, as a second drummer. This combination of musicians inspired John Coltrane to add Rashied Ali as a second drummer the following year. In 1965, Graves continued to expand his horizons, studying the tabla with Wasantha Singh and recording with Miriam Makeba on Makeba Sings!. He also recorded and released a percussion album titled Percussion Ensemble, which featured drummer Sonny Morgan. Val Wilmer wrote that the recording \\"remains just about the most brilliantly conceived and executed percussion album to date.\\" That year, Graves also recorded on the New York Art Quartet's second album Mohawk, on Montego Joe's second album, Wild & Warm, on Lowell Davidson's sole release, and on a second album with Giuseppi Logan, again working with Don Pullen. Graves and Pullen soon formed a duo, and in 1966 they recorded and released In Concert at Yale University, followed by Nommo, on their SRP (\\"Self Reliance Project\\") label. In 1967, Graves joined Albert Ayler's band, replacing Beaver Harris. The group performed at Slugs' Saloon, at the Newport Jazz Festival, and, on July 21, at John Coltrane's funeral. (Recordings of this performance were released in 2004 on the compilation Holy Ghost.) Later that year, the group recorded Love Cry. Graves left Ayler's band when Impulse! began pushing Ayler in a more commercial direction. In the late 1960s, Graves recorded Black Woman with Sonny Sharrock and began playing with drummers Andrew Cyrille and Rashied Ali on a series of concerts titled \\"Dialogue of the Drums.\\" Graves and Cyrille also recorded and released an album without Ali and with the title \\"Dialogue of the Drums\\" in 1974. During this time, Graves studied to become a medical technician and managed a lab for a veterinarian. In 1973, Bill Dixon helped secure Graves a teaching position at Bennington College, where Graves taught until 2012. (Dixon had previously brought Jimmy Lyons, Jimmy Garrison, Alan Shorter, and Alan Silva to Bennington.) In 1977, Graves released two albums under his own name: B√§bi, which featured reed players Arthur Doyle and Hugh Glover, and Meditation Among Us, with a Japanese jazz quartet composed of Kaoru Abe, Toshinori Kondo, Mototeru Takagi, and Toshiyuki Tsuchitori. During the early 1980s, Graves also began working with dancer Min Tanaka. In the years that followed, Graves toured and recorded in a quartet setting with drummers Cyrille, Kenny Clarke, and Famoudou Don Moye, recorded a duo album with David Murray, and performed and recorded with the New York Art Quartet in celebration of their 35th anniversary. He also recorded two solo albums, Grand Unification (1998) and Stories (2000), as well as albums with John Zorn, Anthony Braxton, William Parker, and Bill Laswell. In 2008 and 2012, Graves performed with Lou Reed. In 2017, Graves played on Sam Amidon's album The Following Mountain. 2018 saw Graves performing with bassist Shahzad Ismaily, as well as the release of the documentary Milford Graves Full Mantis, directed by Graves's former student, Jake Meginsky, along with Neil Cloaca Young. In 2019, Graves played in a duo setting with pianist Jason Moran. Alice in Chains vocalist William DuVall also directed a documentary about Graves titled Ancient to Future: The Wisdom of Milford Graves. However, the film has been in post-production status since 2013 and has not been released as of 2020. In 2000, Graves was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in Music Composition,\\"Milford Graves\\". John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. Retrieved May 19, 2020. and in 2015 he received a Doris Duke Foundation Impact Award.\\"2015 Doris Duke Impact Awards\\". Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. Retrieved May 19, 2020. Musical Style Graves, along with Sunny Murray and Rashied Ali, was one of the first jazz musicians to free the drums from their traditional time-keeping role, having developed \\"a conception of... music that went beyond jazz and the ching-a-ding of the ride cymbal.\\" Val Wilmer described Graves as > ...a percussionist with an amazing technique. Graves moved around his > drumset with astonishing speed, beating rapid two-handed tattoos on every > surface. Each stroke was clearly defined so that there were no rolls in the > conventional sense; the emphasis was on clarity. He used his cymbals in the > way another drummer might use a gong or another drum. With the NYAQ, > Graves's snare drum was tuned high as was the norm, but already his tom-toms > were producing a deeper sound than usual. By the end of the 'sixties, > though, he had dispensed with the snare and his three tom-toms were tuned as > loosely as is common in rock today... Graves was probably the first American > drummer to remove all of his bottom heads because of their tendency to > absorb sound. Wilmer also wrote: > His bass drum... is in frequent use, and he habitually holds his sticks by > the tip... Graves was using matched grip before it became fashionable, and > he has another unique grip which enables him to hold two sticks and play on > two surfaces virtually simultaneously. Sometimes he holds a huge mallet or > maracas in the same hand as a regular drumstick, beating with this > combination on the same surface or switching alternately from one beater to > the other. He occasionally takes a small pair of tuned bongoes, places them > in front of him on the skin of one tom-tom and hits them in that position. > The result is a percussive maelstrom of multi-layered intensity. John Szwed wrote that Graves \\"did not use a standard drum setup and sometimes hit the bass drum with a stick or kicked it instead of using a pedal, or he played the snare with a tree branch with the leaves still intact.\\" Graves believes that \\"most drummers are over-occupied with the playing of rhythms and insufficiently with the actual sound,\\" and that it is \\"important for drummers to study the actual membrane, to try for different sounds or a different feeling by playing on every part of the skin and not merely the same area over and over again...\\" He stated that \\"[i]f you know how to manipulate your skins, you can make that dispersed sound - slides, portamento style, sustained tone. Instead of letting your stick free rebound, you can mute it, slide it on there. It calls for greater physicality.\\" Graves told Aakash Mittal: \\"when I play, I do more than vertical strokes. I‚Äôm not just bah-bop bah-bop. My thing is moving around, touching the skins, knowing about momentum and position at the same time.\\" In an interview with Paul Burwell, Graves stated: \\"I relate the drum skin to a body of water... As a musician, you are schooling yourself to deal with some of the most sensitive things in the universe: emotion, frequency, life, the vital force... we're involved with one of the most subtle things in life. Sounds - that's it!\\" Graves has also been very outspoken about his feelings concerning the role of the drummer: \\"I couldn't understand how a guy would sit and play a basic beat all the time. In African drumming, the drum is in the forefront. Timekeeping for the drummer? I said no way.\\" He stated: \\"You just can‚Äôt stay in the background; that‚Äôs not the nature of the instrument. Most drummers are so reduced. And one of the most disrespectful things the drummer can encounter is when they put the drums either in the right or left side corner of the stage, or if they put you there, they‚Äôve got people in front of you.\\" He suggested that drummers not take \\"a greater or lesser role, but an equal role... Not reducing yourself to the point that you were considered just a drummer, not a musician. I resented that more than anything.\\" Non-Musical Interests Graves has pursued a wide variety of non- musical interests. According to Giovanni Russonello, Graves is \\"a kind of underground thought leader in martial arts, natural healing and cellular biology,\\" preferring to \\"live in territory that's uncharted, which often means unseen,\\" reflecting what John Corbett called \\"an axiom of adaptability, a sense that people need to be flexible to deal with new contexts and new challenges.\\" Writing in ArtForum, Christoph Cox stated: \\"Graves has thrown himself into a massive multidisciplinary project that straddles the arts and sciences, traditional healing practices and the frontiers of cardiology and stem-cell research.\\" Many of Graves' interests revolve around what he calls \\"biological music, a synthesis of the physical and mental, a mind-body deal.\\" One example is \\"Yara,\\" a form of martial art that Graves, a former Police Athletic League boxing champ, invented in the early 1970s, and that is \\"spontaneous improvised, and... reacting according to that particular situation,\\" based on \\"the movements of the Praying Mantis, African ritual dance, and Lindy Hop.\\" (According to Graves, Yara means \\"nimbleness\\" in the Yoruba language.) Graves stated that certain aspects of Yara came about as a result of inquiries into the history of martial arts having led him to its roots in nature: \\"What is martial arts? What's Kung Fu? Where did it come from...? I started reading books on Chinese martial arts, the history of this art... There was many times... when I was reading about this so called grandmaster - he'd be up in the mountains meditating, and he saw this and he saw that. I said, 'wow - I could do the same thing, man. I'll just go out in nature 'cause that's where they got it from...' So I went to the best teacher. I went to the praying mantis himself... It goes back to hanging out with nature.\\" Graves taught Yara at his home for over thirty years, with sparring sessions that were \\"hours long and full-contact.\\" Aakash Mittal noted the connections between Graves' martial arts activities and his music, writing: \\"the kinetic motion of yara can be applied with sticks in hand to a cymbal, creating a sonification of the martial arts form itself.\\" Graves explained: \\"When I would spar, I'd sing on people! Put them to sleep. Just like on the trap set, one hand goes this way, the other that way. They never knew what was coming...\\" \\"I would get down to my drum set and I'd go ‚Äî ting-raww‚Äîfrapt! ‚Äî I would keep that whole flow and go around. If I was doing a sword technique, I would practice my sword stuff and with the strokes like ‚Äî thwap!... There I would exchange a stick, so if I'm hitting down here ‚Äî pop! ‚Äî and hitting the cymbal ‚Äî shhhap!... I was directing the energy in a very precise, meaningful way, so they helped each other out. I would hit the sound and just get it, make it go like ‚Äî rat-a-tat-a-rot-a-toko!\\" Graves has related his martial arts activities to his interest in herbal healing, nutrition, acupuncture, and healing using sound and electrical impulses, stating \\"When we test the body, or we grab the body, and hit certain points and grab certain points, you‚Äôre not doing a destructive touch... You're a healing martial artist, a constructive martial artist, not a destructive martial artist... You just don't want to be somebody who learns a martial art to go out and be a bully and hurt somebody. I think that's wrong.\\" Graves is \\"established as both an herbalist and acupuncturist in New York City\\" and is \\"frequently sought out as a healer and acupuncturist by neighbors and artists across the city.\\" For years he has tended what he calls a \\"global garden,\\" using it as a source of herbal remedies and nutritious foods. Graves recalled that his interest in maintaining a healthy lifestyle arose when, in his late teens, he began experiencing severe health problems as a result of regularly drinking cheap wine. He credits a drastic change in his diet with saving his life: \\"The plants! The plants! I didn't get into it cause someone said this is something you should do. It wasn't no hip thing, man. It was necessity. It was illness. I became a vegetarian and I started hanging out, listening to the plants.\\" In the mid-1970s, Graves became fascinated by the notion of \\"the heartbeat as a primary source of rhythm.\\" He stumbled on a recording of heart rhythms, and \\"was astonished by the similarities between cardiac arrhythmias and Afro-Cuban drumming patterns. Beyond the simple da-DUM of the heartbeat, he heard polyrhythmic pulsations, variable duration between beats, and a whole spectrum of frequencies. All this strengthened his conviction that true rhythm isn't metronomic and that the tone of the beat is as important as its duration.\\" He purchased equipment and wrote software that allowed him to record and analyze heartbeats, and began studying his own heartbeat rhythms as well as those of friends and other musicians. After decades of study, Graves used some of the funds from his 2000 Guggenheim Fellowship to purchase additional equipment and software. He wrote: \\"Initially I recorded heartbeats through an electronic stethoscope and listened to the different patterns of those rhythms. More recently, the use of LabVIEW, a software program, has provided much more detailed data. LabVIEW allows me to record the voltages produced by the electrical pulses of the heart, essentially capturing the frequency at which the heart vibrates. These frequencies can then be translated into the audible spectrum and analyzed as sound (heart music), which is accomplished by using specific algorithms written for LabVIEW.\\" By playing the resulting sounds back to a person who acted as a source, Graves \\"found he can increase blood flow and possibly even stimulate cell growth.\\" He wrote that this research \\"has inspired a number of medical studies, including a collaboration with researcher Carlo Ventura which showed that exposure to the heart music caused unassigned stem cells to develop into myocardial (heart) cells.\\" The work also resulted in a patent entitled \\"Method and device for preparing non-embryonic stem cells.\\" Dr. Baruch Krauss, who teaches at Harvard Medical School, is a physician at Boston Children's Hospital, and who studied acupuncture with Graves and follows his research, has described Graves as \\"what a Renaissance man looks like today... Milford is right on the cutting edge of this stuff. He brings to it what doctors can't, because he approaches it as a musician.\\" John Corbett wrote that \\"Graves's heart studies... confirm the falsity of one of the easiest potshots taken at nonmetrical or polymetrical drumming in free jazz, namely, that it's unnatural and doesn't mimic the heart, which is assumed to have a steady beat.\\" Graves stated that regular rhythms are \\"not natural. You have to go against all the rules of nature, use a metronome, inhibit your true ability to sense the rhythms and vibrations of nature. In a pure metric sense, that means that your inhalation and exhalation would always be the same, because when you inhale your beats per minute increases. If you exhale, it decreases. No one breathes that way. Breath varies, so cardiac rhythm never has that tempo. It's always changing.\\" He also stated: \\"We are simply not making music that is up to our potential. The complexities you can hear in the sounds of one person's heartbeat are very similar to free jazz and if we were to make music that was in tune with the vibrations of our bodies, the results would be very powerful.\\" Graves has also provided artwork for some of his albums, and more recently has exhibited sculptures which tie together his interests in music and martial arts, writing: \\"I've been thinking about sculpture as a teaching tool. There's a saying I used to always hear: 'sculpture is frozen music.' I want something with some kind of movement to it. I'm adding elements that are not static, like transducers. I also use my years and years of experience in music and my training in martial arts to understand sculpture. There were movements I used to do that would be very quiet, maybe something from aikido or tai chi. Very slow, very slow... then all of a sudden you would burst out with this explosive, passive-aggressive energy. I wondered how I would put that into a piece of sculpture. I thought the explosion would be to put together some unorthodox elements and have contradictions set in. If a person were to look at it, it would provoke a kind of psychological motion inside of them.\\" Graves' 2017 exhibit at The Artist‚Äôs Institute at Hunter College tied together his interests in music and acupuncture, \\"establishing an energetic connection between music and the natural rhythms of the body.\\" A 2020-2021 exhibit at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia, PA entitled Milford Graves: A Mind-Body Deal will showcase \\"a collection of Graves' hand-painted album covers and posters, idiosyncratic drum sets, multimedia sculptures, photographs, and costumes, with elements from his home, scientific studies, recording ephemera, and archival recordings, as well as space for performance and a reading room.\\" Discography As leader *1965: Percussion Ensemble (ESP) with Sunny Morgan *1977: Meditation Among Us (Kitty) with Kaoru Abe, Toshinori Kondo, Mototeru Takagi, and Toshiyuki Tsuchitori *1977: B√§bi (IPS, reissued on Corbett Vs.

He came to prominence as sideman for Lester Young, Gerry Mulligan, Count Basie, and Lena Horne. Hamilton became a bandleader, first with a quintet featuring the cello as a lead instrument, an unusual choice for a jazz band in the 1950s, and subsequently leading bands that performed cool jazz, post bop, and jazz fusion.  Biography   Early life and career  Foreststorn Hamilton was born in Los Angeles, California, one of three brothers, one of whom was actor Bernie Hamilton.Martin Chilton, \\"Chico Hamilton, jazz drummer, dies\\", The Telegraph, November 27, 2013. Hamilton started his career in a band with Charles Mingus, Illinois Jacquet, Ernie Royal, Dexter Gordon, Buddy Collette and Jack Kelso before he had finished high school. Engagements with Lionel Hampton, Slim & Slam, T-Bone Walker, Lester Young, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Charlie Barnet, Billy Eckstine, Nat King Cole, Sammy Davis Jr., Billie Holiday, Gerry Mulligan and Lena Horne established his career. Hamilton appeared in You'll Never Get Rich (1941) as part of the backing group supporting Fred Astaire. Hamilton also performed on the soundtrack of the Bing Crosby and Bob Hope film Road to Bali (1952).Brian Priestley, \\"Chico Hamilton: Musician\\", The Independent, December 1, 2013.  Bandleader  He recorded his first album as leader in 1955 with George Duvivier (double bass) and Howard Roberts (jazz guitar) for Pacific Jazz. In the same year Hamilton formed an unusual quintet in L.A. featuring cello, flute/saxes/clarinet, guitar, bass and drums. The quintet has been described as one of the last important West Coast jazz bands. The original personnel included flutist/saxophonist/clarinetist Buddy Collette, guitarist Jim Hall, cellist Fred Katz and bassist Jim Aton, who was later replaced by Carson Smith. Hamilton continued to tour, using different personnel, from 1957 to 1960. A version of the quintet including flutist Paul Horn was featured in the film Sweet Smell of Success in 1957 and one including Eric Dolphy appeared in the film Jazz on a Summer's Day (1960), set at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival.John Fordham, \\"Chico Hamilton obituary\\", The Guardian, November 26, 2013. Hamilton revamped his group in 1961 with Charles Lloyd, Gabor Szabo, George Bohanon and Albert Stinson, playing what has been described as chamber jazz, with \\"a moderate avant-gardism.\\" The group recorded for Columbia, Reprise and Impulse Records and also recorded the soundtrack for the industrial film Litho in 1962, the first American film to be shown behind the Iron Curtain. Hamilton formed a commercial and film production company in 1965, and went on to score the feature films Repulsion (1965), Mr. Ricco (1975), Coonskin (1975), By Design (1982), the television programs Portrait of Willie Mays and Gerald McBoing Boing, and scored hundreds of commercials for TV and radio.Profile, npr.org; accessed July 15, 2015. In 1986 Hamilton formed his sextet Chico Hamilton and the Young Alto's featuring Kenneth Lampl, Eric Person and Marc Bernstein. The group performed at the 1986 JVC Jazz Festival, the Apollo Theater, and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.  Later career  Hamilton released Foreststorn in 2001 featuring Euphoria with Cary DeNigris on guitar, Paul Ramsey on bass, and a new two-horn front line with Eric Lawrence on alto and soprano saxes and Evan Schwam on tenor sax, as well as guest appearances from former band members and others. In August 2001, he performed My Funny Valentine: A Tribute to Chico Hamilton at Lincoln Center. In 1997, Hamilton received the New School University Jazz and Contemporary Music Programs' Beacons in Jazz Award in recognition for his \\"significant contribution to the evolution of Jazz\\". In 2002, he was awarded the WLIU-FM Radio Lifetime Achievement Award. At the IAJE in NYC January 2004, he was awarded a NEA Jazz Master Fellowship. In December 2006, Congress confirmed the nomination of Hamilton to the President's Council on the Arts. In 2007, he received a Living Legend Jazz Award as part of The Kennedy Center's Jazz in Our Time Festival, as well as being awarded a Doctor of Fine Arts from The New School. In 2006, Hamilton released four CDs on Joyous Shout! in celebration of his 85th birthday. In 2007, he released Hamiltonia, sampling his original compositions from the four albums released in 2006. Over the years, Hamilton had a series of dance successes, including his signature song \\"Conquistadors\\" from his 1960s Impulse album El Chico, and the Brazilian-influenced song \\"Strut\\" from his 1980 Elektra album, Nomad. In 2002, a track titled \\"For Mods Only\\" from his 1966 Impulse! Records album The Dealer, was included on the Thievery Corporation's Sounds from the Verve Hi-Fi. In 2006, Rong Music released the 12-inch vinyl Kerry's Caravan by Mudd and Hamilton, with remixes from Ray Mang. Several remixes of Hamilton's recordings were released in the late 2000s. He released Twelve Tones of Love on Joyous Shout! in 2009. In March 2011, he had a long recording session, resulting in 28 new tracks with his Euphoria group. Following a health setback in 2010, he and the group began weekly rehearsals at Hamilton's Penthouse A; which brought together the material which would comprise Revelation, an 11-track CD, released in 2011. Death Hamilton died aged 92 on November 25, 2013 in Manhattan. Hamilton was survived by his daughter (Denise), a brother, a granddaughter and two great-granddaughters.

Although he composed some jazz instrumentals such as \\"Chicken and Waffles\\" and \\"Blues\\", Berigan was best known for his virtuoso jazz trumpeting. His 1937 classic recording \\"I Can't Get Started\\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1975. Early life and career Berigan was born in Hilbert, Wisconsin,Bunny Berigan : OLDIES.com at www.oldies.com the son of William Patrick Berigan and Mary Catherine (Mayme) Schlitzberg, and raised in Fox Lake. Having learned the violin and trumpet, Berigan started his career playing with local bands as a teenager including the University of Wisconsin‚Äôs jazz ensemble although he never actually went to college. After first trying out for the Hal Kemp Orchestra and being rejected he joined the band in late 1929. His first recorded trumpet solos were with the orchestra, which toured England and a few other European countries in 1930. He also appeared as featured soloist with bands fronted by Rudy Vallee, Tommy Dorsey, Abe Lyman, Paul Whiteman and Benny Goodman. Shortly after the Kemp orchestra returned to the U.S. in late 1930, Berigan, like fellow trumpeter Mannie Klein, the Dorsey Brothers and Artie Shaw, became a sought-after studio musician in New York. Fred Rich, Freddy Martin and Ben Selvin sought his services for record dates. He joined the staff of CBS radio network musicians in early 1931. Berigan recorded his first vocal, \\"At Your Command\\", with Rich that year. From late 1932 through early 1934, Berigan was a member of Paul Whiteman's orchestra, before playing with Abe Lyman's band briefly in 1934. He returned to freelancing in the New York recording studios and working on staff at CBS radio in 1934. He recorded as a sideman on hundreds of commercial records, most notably with the Dorsey Brothers and on Glenn Miller's earliest recording as a leader in 1935, playing on \\"Solo Hop\\". At the same time, Berigan joined Benny Goodman's Swing band. Jazz talent scout and producer John H. Hammond, who also became Goodman's brother-in-law, later wrote that he helped persuade Gene Krupa to re-join Goodman, with whom he had had an earlier falling-out, by mentioning that Berigan, whom Krupa admired, was already committed to the new ensemble. With Berigan and Krupa both on board, the Goodman band made the tour that ended at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles, the performance often credited with the launch of the swing era.Clarke, Donald. The Rise and Fall of Popular Music (A polemical history). Chapter 9: The Swing Era Begins. Retrieved June 18, 2009. Berigan recorded a number of solos while with Goodman, including \\"King Porter Stomp\\", \\"Sometimes I'm Happy\\", and \\"Blue Skies\\". Fame Berigan left Goodman to return again to freelancing as a recording and radio musician in Manhattan. During this time (late 1935 and throughout 1936), he began to record regularly under his own name, and he continued to back singers such as Bing Crosby, Mildred Bailey, and Billie Holiday. He spent some time with Tommy Dorsey's orchestra in late 1936 and early 1937, working as a jazz soloist on Dorsey's radio program and on several records. His solo on the Dorsey hit recording \\"Marie\\" became one of his signature performances. In 1937, Berigan assembled a band to record and tour under his name, picking the then-little known Ira Gershwin‚ÄìVernon Duke composition \\"I Can't Get Started\\" as his theme song. He made three attempts to organize a band of his own, his last try meeting success, playing trumpet in nearly every number while directing the band. Berigan's trumpet work and vocal made his recorded performance of it for Victor the biggest hit of his career. Berigan modeled his trumpet style in part on Louis Armstrong's, and he often acknowledged Armstrong as his idol. Still, his trumpet sound and jazz ideas were unique, earning Armstrong's praise both before and after Berigan's death. Bandleader Berigan led his own band full-time from early 1937 until June 1942, with a six-month hiatus in 1940 as a sideman in Tommy Dorsey's band. A series of misfortunes and Berigan's alcoholism worked against his financial success as a bandleader. Berigan also began an affair with singer Lee Wiley in 1936, which lasted into 1940. The stresses of bandleading drove Berigan to drink even more heavily. Among the players who worked in the Berigan band were: drummers Buddy Rich, Dave Tough, George Wettling, Johnny Blowers and Jack Sperling; alto saxophonists and clarinetists Gus Bivona, Joe Dixon and Andy Fitzgerald; vocalists Danny Richards, Ruth Bradley and Kathleen Lane; pianist Joe Bushkin; trombonist and arranger Ray Conniff; trombonist Sonny Lee; bassists Hank Wayland and Morty Stulmaker; trumpeters Carl Warwick, Steve Lipkins and Les Elgart; tenor saxophonists Georgie Auld and Don Lodice; and pianist and arranger Joe Lipman. Berigan was regularly featured on CBS Radio's Saturday Night Swing Club broadcasts from 1936 into 1937. This network radio show helped further popularize jazz as the swing era reached its peak. For the balance of the 1930s, he sometimes appeared on this program as a guest. Final years and death Berigan's business troubles drove him to declare bankruptcy in 1939, and shortly after to join Tommy Dorsey as a featured jazz soloist. By September 1940, Berigan briefly led a new small group, but soon reorganized a touring big band. Berigan led moderately successful big bands from the fall of 1940 into early 1942, and was on the comeback trail when his health declined alarmingly. On April 20, 1942, while on tour, Berigan was hospitalized with pneumonia in Allegheny General Hospital Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, until May 8. His doctors discovered that cirrhosis had severely damaged his liver. He was advised to stop drinking and stop playing the trumpet for an undetermined length of time. Berigan did not do either. He returned to his band on tour and played for a few weeks before he returned to the Van Cortlandt Hotel where he made his home in New York City and suffered a massive hemorrhage on May 31, 1942. He died two days later in Stuyvesant Polyclinic Hospital, New York, at age 33. Funeral services were conducted June 3 at Saint Malachy's Roman Catholic Church in New York.Billboard, June 13, 1942 He was buried in St. Mary's Cemetery south of Fox Lake. Legacy In compliance with Berigan's wish, the band was kept intact under his name. Donna Berigan, his widow, maintained his financial interest in it. Tenor sax player Vido Musso became the leader. In 1944, Victor Records released a compilation of Berigan's recordings as bandleader. His 1937 recording of \\"I Can't Get Started\\" was used in the film Save the Tiger (1973), the Roman Polanski film Chinatown (1974), and a Martin Scorsese short film, The Big Shave (1967). Woody Allen has used Berigan's music occasionally in his films. In 2010, his Victor recording of \\"Heigh-Ho\\" was used on a Gap Inc. clothing TV commercial. Berigan's name has been used frequently in the comic strip Crankshaft. Fox Lake, Wisconsin, has held an annual Bunny Berigan Jazz Jubilee since the early 1970s. Most of Berigan's recordings are available, and two full-length biographies of him have been published. Top compositions Berigan's top compositions include \\"Chicken and Waffles\\", released as Decca 18117 in 1935 as by Bunny's Blue Boys, and \\"Blues\\", released in 1935 as Decca 18116, also with the Blue Boys. (This 1935 session was produced by John H. Hammond at Decca for issue in the UK on Parlophone. The Decca releases were part of a four-pocket album set issued in the 1940s during the 1942‚Äì44 musicians' strike.) Honors In 1975, Berigan's 1937 recording \\"I Can't Get Started\\" on Victor (25728-A) was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Berigan was inducted in the ASCAP Jazz Wall of Fame in 2008.2008 Inductees: ASCAP Jazz Wall of Fame.

A highly educated and strictly religious woman, she seemed an unlikely match for the amoral and agnostic poet, and their marriage soon ended in acrimony. Lady Byron's reminiscences, published after her death by Harriet Beecher Stowe, revealed her fears about an alleged incest Lord Byron had with his half-sister. The scandal about Lady Byron's suspicions accelerated Byron's intentions to leave England and return to the Mediterranean where he had lived in 1810. Their daughter Ada worked as a mathematician with Charles Babbage, the pioneer of computer science. Lady Byron had felt that an education in mathematics and logic would counteract any possible inherited tendency towards Lord Byron's perceived insanity and romantic excess. Names Her names were unusually complex. She was born Anne Isabella Milbanke, the only child of Sir Ralph Milbanke, 6th Baronet, and his wife the Hon. Judith Noel, sister of Thomas Noel, Viscount Wentworth.Joan Pierson, 'Noel, Anne Isabella, suo jure Baroness Wentworth, and Lady Byron (1792‚Äì1860)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2006 accessed 11 Aug 2011 When Lord Wentworth died, a few months after her marriage to Lord Byron, Lady Milbanke and her cousin Lord Scarsdale jointly inherited his estate. The family subsequently took the surname Noel over Milbanke. Lord Wentworth had been both a viscount and a baron. Upon his death the viscountcy became extinct, and the barony fell into abeyance between Lady Milbanke and Lord Scarsdale. After their deaths, the barony passed to Lady Byron, and she became Baroness Wentworth in her own right; however, she did not use the title. She signed her letters \\"A. I. Noel Byron\\" and her will as \\"Baroness Noel-Byron\\". The world knew her as \\"Lady Byron\\", and her friends and family called her by her nickname \\"Annabella\\". Youth She was a gifted child. To cultivate her obvious intelligence, her parents hired as her tutor a former Cambridge University professor by the name of William Frend. Under his direction, her education proceeded much like that of a Cambridge student; her studies involved classical literature, philosophy, science and mathematics, in which she particularly delighted. This fascination led her husband to nickname her his \\"princess of parallelograms\\". Annabella developed into a stiff, religious woman with strict morals. She was aware of her strong intellect and was not ashamed to demonstrate it in her social realm. Often described as cold and prim, she seemed an unlikely match for the man who would become her ultimate obsession, the dramatically dark and \\"morally fractured\\" poet Lord Byron. Their first meeting occurred in March 1812. She later said to her mother that though she would not venture to introduce herself to Lord Byron, she would certainly accept his introduction if it were offered. Byron's popularity was soaring following the success of his work Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. Annabella met him on many social occasions as he began a relationship with Caroline Lamb, the wife of her cousin, William Lamb. However, Byron was attracted to her modesty and intellect and in October 1812 he proposed marriage through her aunt, the well- connected political hostess Elizabeth Lamb, Viscountess Melbourne. In response, she wrote a summary of his character and three days later refused him. However, they were plagued with a persistent interest in each other. Although well aware of Byron's shortcomings, telling her mother \\"He is a very bad, very good man\\", she decided it was her religious obligation to support him and improve his behaviour. In August 1813, she contacted him in writing for the first time. The letters continued into the next year, some offering reassurance and support during times when public opinion of him was not favorable, others describing the \\"imperfect attachment\\" she felt for him. During this time, he accepted an invitation from Sir Ralph Milbanke to visit Seaham Hall, the family home in County Durham. Marriage When George Gordon Byron proposed a second time, in September 1814, she was forced and did accept. The couple were married privately, and by special licence, at Seaham Hall in County Durham on 2 January 1815 (the officiating clergyman was her cousin, the Rev. Thomas Noel of Kirkby Mallory, natural son of her uncle, Viscount Wentworth). The couple lived at Piccadilly Terrace in London. Byron was then in extreme financial distress. He rejected payments offered for his written works, as he believed business was not appropriate for a gentleman and gifted copyrights to people who had helped him. He was having difficulty selling his estates at Newstead Abbey and Rochdale to clear his debt. During the summer of 1815, he began to unleash his anger and hostility on his wife. His moods were dark and he began to drink heavily. In a letter to his half- sister, Augusta Leigh, he stated his suspicions that his wife had broken the lock on his desk and searched it. Later in the year he began an affair with Susan Boyce, a London actress at Drury Lane Theatre where he was a director. Annabella became increasingly upset. In the late stages of pregnancy, she feared her husband might be going mad. In November 1815, she wrote to Mrs Leigh and told her of Byron's moods and behaviour. In answer to her sister-in- law's letter, Mrs Leigh traveled to the Byrons' home to assist. Upon her arrival, she became the subject of Byron's wrath and believed him to be temporarily insane. On 10 December, Annabella gave birth to the couple's only child, a daughter whom they named Ada. Byron's despair seemed to increase. Separation In January 1816, as the Byrons passed their first anniversary, Byron decided they must move from the rented house at Piccadilly Terrace. He recommended that Annabella take their daughter to her parents' home and stay there temporarily until he settled their finances. In disbelief, Anne sought medical advice, as she had become convinced her husband had gone mad. She invited a physician to their home to assess him; Byron was unaware of the true purpose for the visit. The doctor recommended she do as Byron requested and move to her parents' estate. Annabella began a detailed documentation of her husband's behaviour, moods, and speech. She contacted his solicitor and friend, John Hanson, and told him her concerns that her husband would take his life. She also provided Hanson with a pamphlet on hydrocephalus, accompanied by notes that suggested Byron could be suffering from this particular affliction. Following this conversation, she took Ada and travelled to her parents' residence at Kirkby Mallory in Leicestershire. She would not see her husband again. Later life During her first month away from him, Annabella wrote to Byron affectionately, addressing him as \\"dearest Duck\\". Her mother wrote to him and invited him to come to their home. However, her concern about him soon became paramount, and her parents sought legal counsel. Their attorney recommended a legal separation and sent Byron a letter proposing the separation. Augusta Leigh, who had remained with Byron at Piccadilly Terrace since his wife's departure, intercepted the letter, as she feared he would commit suicide if he knew of it. She returned the letter to Kirkby Mallory and communicated her opinion that greater consideration should be taken in the matter of the Byrons' marriage. A week later, however, a messenger sent Lord Byron the proposal again. This time it reached him, but he refused to believe that she no longer wanted to be married to him. He asked Mrs Leigh to write to her; in addition, he refused to dissolve their marriage. A short while later, when Lady Byron made clear her suspicions that his relationship with his half- sister Augusta Leigh was incestuous (which was not then illegal) and that he had had homosexual relationships and had sodomised her - Lady Byron - which acts were illegal, he changed his mind. He agreed to grant her request if she proved that the request for legal separation was truly hers and not that of her parents. In response, she personally communicated her feelings to Mrs Leigh. Byron kept his word, and their separation was made legal in March 1816, in a private settlement. Following the settlement, Augusta wrote to Annabella; the latter's solicitor replied to the private note. Byron was enraged by such cold treatment of his half-sister. Soon after the dissolution of his marriage, he left England and lived the remainder of his days abroad. Though she wished to separate from her husband, Annabella was obsessed by him until her death. She was motivated to save his soul and secure him a place in Heaven. In the years following their separation, she came to believe that the time she had spent with him guaranteed he would experience God's embrace upon his death. She kept his letters, copies of her own to him, and letters about him. She carefully documented their relationship, supposedly in preparation for any challenge Lord Byron might make for custody of their daughter. Byron never sought custody of Ada, though he sent for both of them shortly before his death in Greece on 19 April 1824. Lady Byron's obsession with him did not end with his death. Ultimately her relationship with him defined her life, though she committed herself to social causes, such as prison reform and the abolition of slavery. In furtherance of the latter, Lady Byron attended the 1840 World Anti-Slavery Convention, where she was one of the few women included in its commemorative painting.The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840, Benjamin Robert Haydon, accessed 19 July 2008The others were Elizabeth Pease, Amelia Opie, Anne Knight, Mary Anne Rawson, Mrs John Beaumont, Elizabeth Tredgold, Thomas Clarkson's daughter Mary and right at the back Lucretia Mott. Lady Byron lived in Ealing between around 1822 and 1840, and established Ealing Grove School in 1833. Daughter As her daughter grew up, Lady Byron feared she might inherit her father's behaviours and dark moods. She schooled Ada in science and mathematics and discouraged literary study. Though her effort was great, it eventually seemed in vain: Ada Lovelace embodied many of her father's rebellious qualities. She is also considered to have been the world's first computer programmer, having written the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine‚ÄîCharles Babbage's analytical engine. Ada married William King-Noel, 1st Earl of Lovelace when she was 19 and the couple had three children, Byron King-Noel, Viscount Ockham and 12th Baron Wentworth; Anne Blunt, 15th Baroness Wentworth, who brought the Arabian horse to England; and Ralph King-Milbanke, 2nd Earl of Lovelace. Ada amassed considerable gambling debts before dying from cancer on 27 November 1852. Lady Byron attended her daughter's deathbed and, under her influence, Ada underwent a religious conversion. Ada was 36 years old when she died, the same age as Byron when he died. Death Anne is listed as Lady Noel Byron on the Reformers Monument, Kensal Green Cemetery Lady Byron died of breast cancer on 16 May 1860, the day before her 68th birthday. She was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery at Kensal Green in London. Prior to her death, she shared the story of her marriage to Byron with Harriet Beecher Stowe, who encouraged her to remain silent. In 1869, some years later, Stowe published the account given to her, the first time anyone had publicly hinted at an incestuous relationship between Byron and his half-sister. (Ebook available at Project Gutenberg.) Stowe was criticized for writing a supposedly \\"indecent\\" article and lost popularity. Initially biographers criticized Lady Byron as \\"small-minded;\\" more recent works have provided a fuller picture of her accomplishments. Lady Byron's barony passed to her grandson Byron King-Noel, Viscount Ockham. In her will she left a ¬£300 legacy to the writer George MacDonald, whom she had patronized during her life. Lady Byron Lane, off Knowle Road, Solihull, is named after her. Lady Byron was heiress of the Knowle estates through her father, Sir Ralph Milbanke Noel.

The station was opened on July 1, 1977, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Providing service for the Blue, Silver, and Orange Lines, the station is located on I Street on the George Washington University (GWU) campus. It is the last westbound station in the District of Columbia on these lines before they dive under the Potomac River to Virginia.  History  The station opened on July 1, 1977. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail between National Airport and RFK Stadium and the opening of the Arlington Cemetery, Capitol South, Crystal City, Eastern Market, Federal Center SW, Federal Triangle, L'Enfant Plaza, McPherson Square, National Airport, Pentagon, Pentagon City, Potomac Avenue, Rosslyn, Smithsonian and Stadium‚ÄìArmory stations. Orange Line service to the station began upon the line's opening on November 20, 1978.  Station layout  Foggy Bottom‚ÄìGWU uses a simple island platform layout: one platform with a track on each side. Track C1 carries eastbound trains to New Carrollton and Largo Town Center whilst track C2 is used by westbound trains to Vienna and Franconia‚ÄìSpringfield. As with all stations on the Metro, there are platform edge lights to warn passengers of incoming trains. In 2008, the WMATA installed red-colored LED lights at Foggy Bottom‚ÄìGWU and other busy stations after a successful pilot at Gallery Place. There is a 22 coffer \\"waffle vault\\" ceiling at Foggy Bottom‚ÄìGWU as it was one of the first stations to be built in the system; later underground stations abandoned this design for a simpler concrete arch. There is a single mezzanine located at the centre of the platform. Escalators from here allow passengers to descend to platform level or to the sole entrance and exit of the station at the northwestern corner of I and 23rd Streets. A total of two elevators and six escalators (three between the street and mezzanine and three between the mezzanine and platform) are currently in use at the station.  Location  Foggy Bottom‚ÄìGWU serves the neighborhood of Foggy Bottom and the campus of The George Washington University. It is also the nearest station to the Georgetown neighborhood. The station is located at 23rd and I streets in Northwest, just south of Washington Circle, and at the front entrance to the George Washington University Hospital. Service began on July 1, 1977. The World Bank is located one block south and eight blocks east at Pennsylvania Avenue and 18th Street and The Watergate is slightly more than .75 miles (1.2 km) southwest of the station. Slightly south of The Watergate is the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

The NCBI is a part of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), which is itself a department of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which in turn is a part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The name \\"Entrez\\" (a greeting meaning \\"Come in\\" in French) was chosen to reflect the spirit of welcoming the public to search the content available from the NLM. Entrez Global Query is an integrated search and retrieval system that provides access to all databases simultaneously with a single query string and user interface. Entrez can efficiently retrieve related sequences, structures, and references. The Entrez system can provide views of gene and protein sequences and chromosome maps. Some textbooks are also available online through the Entrez system.  Features  The Entrez front page provides, by default, access to the global query. All databases indexed by Entrez can be searched via a single query string, supporting boolean operators and search term tags to limit parts of the search statement to particular fields. This returns a unified results page, that shows the number of hits for the search in each of the databases, which are also links to actual search results for that particular database. Entrez also provides a similar interface for searching each particular database and for refining search results. The Limits feature allows the user to narrow a search a web forms interface. The History feature gives a numbered list of recently performed queries. Results of previous queries can be referred to by number and combined via boolean operators. Search results can be saved temporarily in a Clipboard. Users with a MyNCBI account can save queries indefinitely and also choose to have updates with new search results e-mailed for saved queries of most databases. It is widely used in the field of biotechnology as a reference tool for students and professionals alike.

The C-160 remains in service more than 50 years after the type's first flight in 1963. It has provided logistical support to overseas operations and has served in specialist roles such as an aerial refueling tanker, electronic intelligence gathering, and as a communications platform. The C-160 is expected to be replaced in French and German service by the Airbus A400M Atlas.Hewson, R. The Vital Guide to Military Aircraft 2nd edition. London: Airlife Publishing Ltd., 2001. Development Origins In the late 1950s, a requirement arose to replace the piston-engined Nord Noratlas transports operated by the air forces of both France (Arm√©e de l'Air) and Germany (Luftwaffe). Keen to encourage industrial co-operation between the two countries, as had happened under a previous arrangement in which Noratlases for German service had been built under license by Weser Flugzeugbau, France and Germany signed an agreement for the development of a Noratlas successor on 28 November 1957. The Italian government also became involved in the project early on to meet their own requirements, however Italy's participation in the fledgling program was soon terminated in favour of the smaller and locally- built Fiat G.222. The consortium, \\"Transporter-Allianz\\" or Transall, was formed in January 1959 between the French company Nord Aviation and the German companies Weser Flugzeugbau (which became Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW) in 1964) and Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HFB) to design and build the new transport.Wilson Flight International 25 April 1968, p. 614.Pletschacher Air International June 1981, p. 286. The new aircraft was required to carry a cargo over a range of or a load of over a range of and be able to operate out of semi-prepared airstrips.Wilson Flight International 25 April 1968, pp. 614‚Äì615. One prototype was built by each of the production partners, with the first (built by Nord) flying on 25 May 1963, with the VFW and HFB-built prototypes following on 25 May 1963 and 19 February 1964.Wilson Flight International 25 April 1968, p. 615. These were followed by six pre-production examples, stretched by compared with the prototypes, which flew between 1965 and 1966.Wilson Flight International 25 April 1968, p. 616. Production Production orders were delayed by attempts by Lockheed to sell its C-130 Hercules transport to Germany; these attempts were rebuffed, and a contract was signed for 160 C-160s (110 for Germany and 50 for France) on 24 September 1964. Manufacturing work was split between Germany and France in line with the number of orders placed; Nord built the wings and engine nacelles, VFW the centre fuselage and horizontal tail, and HFB the forward and rear fuselage. The aircraft's tail fin was to be built by Dornier. Three production lines were set up to assemble these components at each of the three main partners. The first production airframes were delivered to France and Germany from 1967. The first batch included 110 C-160Ds for the German Air Force (Luftwaffe), 50 C-160Fs for the French Air Force, and nine C-160Zs for the South African Air Force. Four C-160Fs were converted to C-160P air mail transport aircraft, and were operated by Air France.Pletschacher Air International June 1981, p. 289. Production continued until October 1972. In July 1977, France placed an order for 25 aircraft to be built to an improved standard.Pletschacher Air International June 1981, p. 285. Production work for the new variant was split 50-50 between A√©rospatiale (the successor to Nord) and MBB (which had absorbed VFW and HFB), with a single assembly line in Toulouse. The cargo loading door on the port side of the fuselage was replaced by provision for additional fuel tanks in the wing centre section. When fitted these tanks increased fuel capacity from to . The aircraft were also fitted with updated avionics.Pletschacher Air International June 1981, pp. 286‚Äì287. The first second generation C-160 took flight in 1981.Chant 1987, p. 472. Aircraft produced in this batch included 29 for France (an additional four non-standard aircraft were constructed for special missions), and 6 for Indonesia.Blumschein 1999, p. A26-2. Design Overview C-160 on a rough landing strip, 1985 The Transall C-160 is a twin-engine tactical transport featuring a cargo hold, a rear-access ramp beneath an upswept tail, a high-mounted wing and turboprop engines. The C-160 is designed to perform cargo and troop transport duties, aerial delivery of supplies and equipment and is designed to be compatible with international railway loading gauges to simplify cargo logistics and loading. in flight the cargo area is pressurised and kept at a constant temperature by integrated air conditioning systems.Wache 2004, p. 100. The auxiliary power unit and port-side main landing gear of a Luftwaffe C-160, 2008 Additionally, the landing gear can be partially retracted while on the ground. This lowers the C-160, making it easier to move vehicles into the hold as they don't need to climb a ramp. One aspect of the C-160 that made the type well suited to tactical operations was the type's short airfield performance; including the ability to perform steep descents of up to 20 degrees and perform landings on airstrips as short as 400 meters.\\"Transall ‚Äì Strategy behind a tactical aircraft\\" Flight International, 1979. In the airlift role, a later production C-160 could carry up to 8.5 tons across a distance of 5,000 kilometers, and take off from airstrips as short as 700 meters. Dependent upon aircraft configuration, a single aircraft could airdrop as many as 88 paratroopers or transport up to 93 equipped troops.Rouvez, Coco and Paddack 1994, p. 96. The C-160 is powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Tyne turboprop engines, which drives a pair of four-bladed Dowty Rotol propellers. Advantages of the twin-engine configuration over four include reduced unit and production cost, lower weight and fuel consumption, simplified design and reliability. Each engine is equipped with an auxiliary generator system, providing the aircraft with both electricity and hydraulic pressure.Wache 2004, p. 96. An auxiliary power unit {General Electric CJ610) is used to power the aircraft while on the ground, and for rare use in mid-air emergencies.Wache 2004, p. 97. Upgrades and improvements An updated second generation of the C-160 was produced during the 1980s. Amongst changes made, the new variant was equipped with additional fuel tankage, aerial refuelling probes and enhanced avionics. While there were considerable changes to instrumentation, including the navigational and autopilot systems, the second generation C-160 retained the original operating characteristics to simplify crew transfers between types. The second generation C-160s were also designed for potential adaptation to other roles such as maritime patrol and aerial fire fighting.\\"C-160 \\"Military ‚Äì Fixed Wing.\\" Flight International, 15 November 1980. p. 1885. A German Air Force Transall at ILA 2016 The C-160 proved to be a versatile aircraft, leading to a long operational service life. Between its introduction and 1999, approximately 2000 modifications and upgrades were incorporated upon the type, split 60/40 between the structure and equipment respectively.Blumschein 1999, p. A26-4. Many changes were made over time in regards to the aircraft's avionics, incorporating new features such as GPS and laser inertial navigation systems, modern autopilot and crew management systems.Blumschein 1999, p. A26-4-5. Other improvements and additions to the type include kevlar armour, electronic warfare management systems, chaff/flare dispensers, missile approach warning systems and TCAS collision warning system. Extensive efforts have been made by both France and Germany to extend the aircraft's operating lifespan up to and if necessary beyond 55 years to 2018.Blumschein 1999, p. A26-1-3. In 2003‚Äì2004, Germany signed separate contracts with Terma A/S and Northrop Grumman to upgrade the aircraft's electronic warfare self-protection and missile approach warning systems. Operational history A C-160 performing a steep descent prior to landing, 2005 In April 1976, the French Air Force used 12 C-160s in support of Operation Verveine, airlifting Moroccan troops and equipment to Za√Øre during a border conflict with Angola. In May 1978, several C-160s dropped paratroopers of the French Foreign Legion during the Battle of Kolwezi. In 1977, the French Air Force ordered an updated version designated C-160NG, for Nouvelle G√©n√©ration (\\"New Generation\\"). From 1981, 29 of these aircraft were delivered, half of them configured as tanker aircraft for aerial refuelling. Another four were configured as C-160H Astart√© TACAMO aircraft for communication with submerged submarines, a vital component of France's nuclear deterrent system. In a final conversion, two aircraft were furnished for SIGINT electronic surveillance, designated C-160G Gabriel, replacing the Noratlases that had been in this role previously. In routine operations, the C-160Gs would often supplement France's Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft.Aid and Wiebes 2001, p. 198. In 1991, a SIGNIT-equipped C-160G was deployed as part of France's contribution to Coalition forces during and after the Gulf War to support a no-fly zone and embargoing of Iraq. A pair of French Air Force C-160s flying overhead, 2006 C-160s were in continuous use to support French bases in sub- Saharan Africa; the tanker variants also proved valuable in supporting African operations.Rouvez, Coco and Paddack 1994, pp. 97‚Äì98. The C-160 fleet was the staple of the French military airlift capability for many years, supplemented by small numbers of McDonnell Douglas DC-8s, CASA/IPTN CN-235 and Lockheed C-130 Hercules as of 1990.Rouvez, Coco and Paddack 1994, pp. 96‚Äì97. During the South African Border War during the late 1980s, the South African Air Force's C-160s were vital for deploying and supplying troops in the border region and into positions in southern Angola due to the otherwise-impassable terrain. The importance of airpower in the war led to a great deal of the fighting being centred upon remote airstrips, both sides trying to gain or deny the same advantageous positions and place stress upon the opposing force's logistical efforts.Johnson, Grissom and Oliker 2008, pp. 217‚Äì218. In one particular mission, a C-160 was used to move a captured SA-8 from Angola to South Africa. The C-160 was chosen for this task over the C-130 because of its larger cargo hold and its ability to lower its hull while on the ground, which facilitated the loading of the heavy vehicle.Dick Lord, 2019, From Fledgling to Eagle: The South African Air Force during the Border War, Chapter 14 The C-160 has been a prominent component of several other international efforts. Germany's C-160 fleet has been used to support peacekeeping efforts in Sudan,\\"Sudan accuses Israel, Germany of involvement in Darfur conflict\\". Sudan Tribunal, 22 December 2004. a regular detachment of C-160s was also dispatched in support of the multinational International Security Assistance Force presence in the Afghanistan.\\"German planes begin supply flights for anti-terror campaign, sharing burden with U.S. crews\\". Associated Press, 26 November 2001. Both French and German C-160s were used in supporting Operation Serval, the French- led intervention in the Northern Mali conflict.M√úller, Alberecht. \\"German Government Wants To Boost Support for Malian Operation.\\" defensenews.com, 7 February 2013. For either humanitarian or military purposes, C-160s have conducted extensive operations in a number of nations, including Mauritania, Niger, Chad, Ethiopia, Bosnia, and Lebanon.Wache 2004, pp. 68, 82. Wiesel combat vehicle being loaded into a C-160 via the rear ramp, 2010 Starting in 1984 onwards, German airframes underwent LEDA I and LEDA II life extension measures, which were focused on the wings. Subsequent programs carried out in the 1990s, such as LEDA III, concentrated on the whole structure of the aircraft; raising the airframe life from 8,000 flights to 12,000 flights, and introducing new avionics systems such as a self-defence system and a replacement flight management system.Blumschein 1999, p. A26-1. From 1994 to 1999, all French C-160s underwent an avionics upgrade and the addition of new anti-missile countermeasures. The C-160Fs and NGs so updated were redesignated C-160R (Renov√©‚Äî\\"renovated\\"). In 2009, the French Defence Ministry announced a modernisation of the C-160 fleet, enabling it to continue in service until 2018 if required.Mackenzie, Christina. \\"France to Upgrade C-160 Transalls.\\" Aviation Week, 5 June 2009. In late 2011, it was announced that Germany's Transall fleet had accumulated a combined total of one million flight hours.Timo Braam, Alexander Br√§utigam. \\"Transall C-160 erfliegt eine Millionste Flugstunde.\\" Luftwaffe.de, 5 October 2011. , the global C-160 fleet was approaching the end of its service life; all South African C-160s have already been retired, while the Turkish Air Force continued to operate 20 aircraft obtained from Germany (C-160T). To replace the Transall, the German, French and South African Air Forces ordered 60, 50 and eight Airbus A400Ms, respectively;Hoyle, Craig. \\"Europe's Transall turns 50.\\" Flight Global, 25 February 2013. the South African order was later cancelled.Roberts, Janice. \\"Airbus refunds A400M payments to Armscor.\\" Moneyweb, 19 December 2011. In 2015, it was announced that the retirement of Germany's Transall fleet had been pushed back from 2018 to 2021 due to delays with the Airbus A400M; until 2021, a decreasing number of aircraft shall remain in service to perform missions that require the Transall's self-protection suite.Stevenson, Beth. \\"Germany to join multinational tanker effort.\\" Flight International, 2 December 2015.\\"LTG 63 fliegt noch bis 2021 mit Transall.\\" Luftwaffe.de, 14 December 2015.

The now C-160NG (Nouvelle Generation, New Generation) called aircraft has a fifth fuel tank in the middle of the wing above the fuselage, a refueling probe while the left side cargo door was removed. Some first-production series C-160F were fitted with the NG-versions changes and renamed C-160R (Renov√©). Beside these changes, French Air Force introduced the C-160G Gabriel, a version for electronic reconnaissance, easily to distinguish because of the antennas fitted to the aircraft. Until the early 2000s, also the C-160H Astarte was used, while Astart√© (Avion Station Relais de Transmissions Exceptionelles), meaning \\"airborne relay station for special transmissions\\", was used for communication with submerged French nuclear submarines.

He was influenced by native Mexican cultures. Of his six symphonies, the second, or Sinfon√≠a india, which uses native Yaqui percussion instruments, is probably the most popular. Biography National Conservatory of Music. M√©xico City The seventh child of a creole family, Ch√°vez was born on Tacuba Avenue in Mexico City, near the suburb of Popotla . His paternal grandfather, Jos√© Mar√≠a Ch√°vez Alonso, served as governor of the state of Aguascalientes and was executed on the orders of Emperor Maximilian in 1864. His father, August√≠n Ch√°vez, who died when Carlos was barely three years old, invented a plough that was produced and used in the United States.. Carlos had his first piano lessons from his brother Manuel, and later on he was taught piano by Asunci√≥n Parra, Manuel Ponce, and Pedro Luis Ozag√≥n, and harmony by Juan Fuentes. His family often holidayed in Tlaxcala, Michoac√°n, Guanajuato, Oaxaca, and other places where the cultural influence of the Mexican indigenous peoples was still very strong . In 1916, Ch√°vez and friends started a cultural journal, Gladios, and this led to his joining the staff of the Mexico City newspaper in 1924. In the succeeding 36 years he was to write over 500 items for this paper (; ). After the Mexican Revolution and the installation of a democratically elected president, √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n, Ch√°vez became one of the first exponents of Mexican nationalist music with ballets on Aztec themes . In September 1922, Ch√°vez married Otilia Ortiz and they went on honeymoon to Europe, from October 1922 until April 1923, spending two weeks in Vienna, five months in Berlin, and eight or ten days in Paris . During the latter visit he met Paul Dukas . Some months later, in December 1923, Ch√°vez visited the United States for the first time, returning in March 1924 . Ch√°vez again went to New York City in September 1926 and stayed there until June 1928 . Upon his return to Mexico, Ch√°vez became director of the Orquesta Sinf√≥nica Mexicana (Mexican Symphonic Orchestra), later renamed Orquesta Sinf√≥nica de M√©xico (Mexico's Symphonic Orchestra); the country's first permanent orchestra, started by a musicians' labor union. Ch√°vez was instrumental in taking the orchestra on tour through Mexico's rural areas. In December 1928, Ch√°vez was appointed director of Mexico's National Conservatory of Music‚Äîa position he held for a total of five years (until March 1933, and again for eight months in 1934). In that capacity, Ch√°vez spearheaded three academias de investigaci√≥n, two concerned with collecting and cataloguing indigenous music and its literature, and the third to study the uses of old and new scales . In 1937, Ch√°vez published a book, Toward a New Music, which is one of the first books in which a composer speaks about electronic music. In 1938, he conducted a series of concerts with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, during a period of absence by the orchestra's regular conductor, Arturo Toscanini. In 1940 he produced concerts at New York's Museum of Modern Art, and by 1945, Ch√°vez had come to be regarded as the foremost Mexican composer and conductor . From January 1947 until 1952, Ch√°vez served as director-general of the National Institute of Fine Arts. In his first year, he formed the National Symphony Orchestra, which supplanted the older OSM as Mexico's premier orchestra and led to the disbanding of the older ensemble. Throughout all this time, Ch√°vez maintained a busy international touring schedule . Carlos Ch√°vez's tomb in the Pante√≥n de Dolores, Mexico City In May 1953 he was commissioned by Lincoln Kirstein, director of the New York City center of Music and Drama, for a three-act opera to a libretto by Chester Kallman based on a story by Boccaccio, to be titled The Tuscan Players. Intended to be finished in August 1954, it was first postponed to April 1955, but only finally completed in 1956, by which time the title had been changed twice, first to P√°nfilo and Lauretta, then to . The City Center waived its rights to the first performance, which was given under the title Panfilo and Lauretta in the Brander Matthews Theatre at Columbia University in New York on May 9, 1957, under the baton of Howard Shanet. Stage direction was by Bill Butler, scenic design by Herbert Senn and Helen Pond, and costumes by Sylvia Wintle. The principal singers were Sylvia Stahlman, Frank Porretta, Craig Timberlake, Mary McMurray, Michael Kermoyan, and Thomas Stewart . The opera would be revised twice more and the title changed again to (The Visitors), for productions in 1968 and 1973, in Mexico City and Aptos, California, respectively (; ). From 1958‚Äì1959 he was the Charles Eliot Norton professor at Harvard University, and the public lectures he gave there were published as a book, Musical Thought . From 1970 to 1973, Carlos Ch√°vez served as the music director of the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music. His orchestral composition Discovery (1969) had previously been commission by the Festival and was first performed there. Failing health and financial setbacks forced Ch√°vez to sell his house in the Lomas de Chapultepec neighborhood of Mexico City and move in with his daughter Anita in Coyoac√°n, in the fringes of the Mexican capital, where he died quietly on 2 August 1978 . Carlos Ch√°vez's manuscripts and papers are housed in the Music Division of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts and in the National Archive of Mexico, in Mexico City. Musical style Ch√°vez's music does not fall into clear stylistic periods, but rather cumulates elements in a process of continual synthesis. The juvenilia, up to 1921 and consisting primarily of piano compositions, is essentially Romantic, with Robert Schumann as the main influence. A period of nationalistic leanings was initiated in 1921 with the Aztec-themed ballet (The New Fire), followed by a second ballet, (The Four Suns), in 1925 . During his time in New York City between 1924 and 1928, Ch√°vez acquired a taste for the then-fashionable abstract and quasi-scientific music, as is reflected in the titles of many of his compositions written between 1923 and 1934: for piano (Polygons, 1923), for voice and piano (Hexagons, 1924), 36 for piano (1925), for nine instruments (Energy, 1925), for violin and piano (Spiral, 1934), and an unfinished orchestral score titled (Pyramids). The culmination of this period was the ballet H. P. (i.e., Horse Power), also known by the Spanish title (1926‚Äì31) . H. P. is a colorfully orchestrated score of ample dimensions and dense, compact atmosphere, notable for its dynamism and vitality, revealing the influence of Stravinsky and at the same time returning to folkloric and popular elements, with dances such as the sandunga, tango, huapango, and foxtrot . Such nationalisms would appear through the 1930s, notably in the Second Symphony (the of 1935‚Äì36, one of the few works by Ch√°vez to quote actual Native-American themes), but only sporadically in later compositions . Although this early period saw the creation of the Sonatina for violin and piano (1924), it was only in the 1930s that Ch√°vez returned to another of the main musical interests of his maturity, prefigured in the juvenilia: the traditional genres of the sonata, quartet, symphony, and concerto . He composed six numbered symphonies. The first, titled (1933), was reworked from incidental music for Jean Cocteau's Antigone, an adaptation of Sophocles' tragedy. In it, Ch√°vez sought to create an archaic ambiance through the use of modal polyphony, harmonies built on fourths and fifths, and a predominant use of wind instruments . In the fourth of his Norton lectures of 1958‚Äì59, titled \\"Repetition in Music\\" , he described a mode of composition already observable in many of his compositions since the 1920s, in which \\"The idea of repetition and variation can be replaced by the notion of constant rebirth, of true derivation: a stream that never comes back to its source; a stream in eternal development, like a spiral ‚Ä¶\\" . A notable early example of this method is Soli I (1933), the first work acknowledged by the composer to have been consciously organized according to this principle. It only became a regular feature, however, beginning with Invenci√≥n I for piano (1958), and subsequently in most of his instrumental compositions of the 1960s and 1970s: Invenci√≥n II for string trio (1965), Invenci√≥n III for harp (1967), Soli II for wind quintet (1961), Soli III for bassoon, trumpet, viola, timpani, and orchestra (1969), Soli IV for brass trio (1966), Cinco Caprichos for piano (1975), and the late orchestral works Resonancias (1964), Elatio (1967), Discovery (1969), Clio (1969), and Initium (1970‚Äì72) . Recordings Ch√°vez made more than a handful of recordings, conducting his own music as well as that of other composers. One of the earliest was made in the 1930s for Victor, containing Ch√°vez's Sinfon√≠a de Ant√≠gona and Sinfon√≠a india, together with his orchestration of Dietrich Buxtehude's Chaconne in E minor: 4-disc 78-rpm set, Victor Musical Masterpiece Series, Victor Red Seal M 503 (manual sequence) and DM 503 (automatic sequence). The best-known of his discs was the Everest Records stereophonic recording of his Sinfon√≠a India, Sinfon√≠a de Ant√≠gona, and Sinfon√≠a Rom√°ntica, in which Ch√°vez conducted the Stadium Symphony Orchestra, the name given to the New York Philharmonic Orchestra for its summer performances in the Lewisohn Stadium. The album was originally issued in 1959 by Everest Records on LP SDBR 3029, and was reissued on CD in 1996 by Everest as EVC-9041, as well as at some point by Philips Records. In 1963 Ch√°vez conducted the Vienna State Opera Orchestra in two recordings with pianist Eugene List for Westminster Records, both released on LP: one of his own Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (Westminster WST 17030, reissued in 1976 as Westminster Gold WGS 8324) and one of the two piano concertos by Edward Macdowell (ABC Westminster Gold WGS 8156). In the 1950s he released two recordings on US Decca records, on which he conducted the Orquesta Sinf√≥nica de M√©xico. In 1951 a 10-inch mono LP was issued (Decca Gold Label DL 7512, reissued 1978 by Var√®se Sarabande on side 2 of 12-inch LP ), containing his Suite from La hija de C√≥lquide (originally recorded in 1947 for the Mexican label Anfi√≥n and issued as a 3-disc 78 rpm set Anfi√≥n AM 4), and in 1956 they released an anthology, Music of Mexico, on which he conducted three of his own works, plus Jos√© Pablo Moncayo's Huapango (Decca Gold Label LP, DL9527). He also made some recordings for Columbia Records which were issued on 78-rpm discs and on LP (Columbia 4-disc 78-rpm set M 414, reissued 1949 on Columbia 10-inch LP, Columbia ML 2080 and Mexican Columbia DCL 98, reissued on Columbia 12-inch LP, LL 1015; CBS Masterworks 3-LP set 32 31 0001 (mono)/ 32 31 002 (stereo); CBC Masterworks LP 32 11 0064; Columbia LP M32685; Odyssey LP Y 31534). In 1961 he recorded Sergey Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf, with the Orquesta Sinf√≥nica de M√©xico and Carlos Pellicer, narrator, released on Mexican CBS MC 1360.

John Marston (baptised 7 October 1576 ‚Äì 25 June 1634) was an English poet, playwright and satirist during the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean periods. His career as a writer lasted only a decade. His work is remembered for its energetic and often obscure style, its contributions to the development of a distinctively Jacobean style in poetry, and its idiosyncratic vocabulary. Life Marston was born to John and Maria Marston n√©e Guarsi, and baptised October 7, 1576 at Wardington, Oxfordshire. His father was an eminent lawyer of the Middle Temple who first argued in London and then became the counsel to Coventry and ultimately its steward. John Marston entered Brasenose College, Oxford in 1592 and received his BA in 1594. By 1595, he was in London, living in the Middle Temple, where he had been admitted a member three years previously. He had an interest in poetry and play writing, although his father's will of 1599 expresses the hope that he would give up such vanities. He married Mary Wilkes in 1605, daughter of the Reverend William Wilkes, one of King James's chaplains. Early career Marston's brief career in literature began with a foray into the then-fashionable genres of erotic epyllion and satire. In 1598, he published The Metamorphosis of Pigmalion's Image and Certaine Satyres, a book of poetry in imitation of, on the one hand, Ovid, and, on the other, the Satires of Juvenal. He also published another book of satires, The Scourge of Villanie, in 1598. (Marston issued these satires under the pseudonym \\"W. Kinsayder.\\") The satire in these books is even more savage and misanthropic than was typical for the decade's satirists. Marston's style is, moreover, in places contorted to the point of unintelligibility: he believed that satire should be rough and obscure, perhaps because he thought (as did many other writers of the time) that the term 'satire' was derived from the Greek 'satyr plays'. Marston seems to have been enraged by Joseph Hall's claim to be the first satirist in English; Hall comes in for some indirect flyting in at least one of the satires. Some see William Shakespeare's Thersites and Iago, as well as the mad speeches of King Lear as influenced by The Scourge of Villanie. Marston had, however, arrived on the literary scene as the fad for verse satire was to be checked by censors. The Archbishop of Canterbury John Whitgift and the Bishop of London Richard Bancroft banned the Scourge and had it publicly burned, along with copies of works by other satirists, on 4 June 1599. Playwriting with Henslowe In September 1599, John Marston began to work for Philip Henslowe as a playwright. Following the work of O. J. Campbell, it has commonly been thought that Marston turned to the theatre in response to the Bishops' Ban of 1599; more recent scholars have noted that the ban was not enforced with great rigor and might not have intimidated prospective satirists at all. At any rate, Marston proved a good match for the stage‚Äînot the public stage of Henslowe, but the \\"private\\" playhouses where boy players performed racy dramas for an audience of city gallants and young members of the Inns of Court. Traditionally, though without strong external attribution, Histriomastix has been regarded as his first play; performed by either the Children of Paul's or the students of the Middle Temple in around 1599, it appears to have sparked the War of the Theatres, the literary feud between Marston, Jonson and Dekker that took place between around 1599 and 1602. In c. 1600, Marston wrote Jack Drum's Entertainment and Antonio and Mellida, and in 1601 he wrote Antonio's Revenge, a sequel to the latter play; all three were performed by the company at Paul's. In 1601, he contributed poems to Robert Chester's Love's Martyr. For Henslowe, he may have collaborated with Dekker, Day, and Haughton on Lust's Dominion. Feud with Jonson Ben Jonson: rival, co-author, frenemy By 1601, he was well known in London literary circles, particularly in his role as enemy to the equally pugnacious Ben Jonson. Jonson, who reported to Drummond that Marston had accused him of sexual profligacy, satirized Marston as Clove in Every Man Out of His Humour, as Crispinus in Poetaster, and as Hedon in Cynthia's Revels. Jonson criticised Marston for being a false poet, a vain, careless writer who plagiarised the works of others and whose own works were marked by bizarre diction and ugly neologisms. For his part, Marston may have satirized Jonson as the complacent, arrogant critic Brabant Senior in Jack Drum's Entertainment and as the envious, misanthropic playwright and satirist Lampatho Doria in What You Will. The Return from Parnassus (II), a satirical play performed at St. John's College, Cambridge in 1601 and 1602, characterised Marston as a poet whose writings see him \\"pissing against the world\\". cites The Return from Parnassus, Part Two, I.ii, ll. 266‚Äì70. If Jonson can be trusted, the animosity between himself and Marston went beyond the literary. He claimed to have beaten Marston and taken his pistol. However, the two playwrights were reconciled soon after the so-called War; Marston wrote a prefatory poem for Jonson's Sejanus in 1605 and dedicated The Malcontent to Jonson. Yet in 1607, he criticized Jonson for being too pedantic to make allowances for his audience or the needs of aesthetics. Blackfriars Outside of these tensions, Marston's career continued to prosper. In 1603, he became a shareholder in the Children of Blackfriars company, at that time known for steadily pushing the allowable limits of personal satire, violence, and lewdness on stage. He wrote and produced two plays with the company. The first was The Malcontent in 1603; this satiric tragicomedy is Marston's most famous play. This work was originally written for the children at Blackfriars, and was later taken over (perhaps stolen) by the Kings' Men at the Globe, with additions by John Webster and (perhaps) Marston himself. George Chapman: co- author (with Marston and Jonson) of Eastward Ho! Marston's second play for the Blackfriars children was The Dutch Courtesan, a satire on lust and hypocrisy, in 1604-5. In 1605, he worked with George Chapman and Ben Jonson on Eastward Ho, a satire of popular taste and the vain imaginings of wealth to be found in Virginia. Chapman and Jonson were arrested for, according to Jonson, a few clauses that offended the Scots, but Marston escaped any imprisonment. The actual cause of arrest and details of the brief detainment are not certainly known; in the event, charges were dropped. In 1606, Marston seems to have offended and then soothed King James. First, in Parasitaster, or, The Fawn, he satirized the king specifically. However, in the summer of that year, he put on a production of The Dutch Courtesan for the King of Denmark's visit, with a Latin verse on King James that was presented by hand to the king. Finally, in 1607, he wrote The Entertainment at Ashby, a masque for the Earl of Huntingdon. At that point, he stopped his dramatic career altogether, selling his shares in the company of Blackfriars. His departure from the literary scene may have been because of another play, now lost, which offended the king. It seems that the French ambassador complained to King James about the disrespectful treatment of the French court in plays by Chapman performed at Blackfriars. To strengthen his case he added that another play had been performed in which James himself was depicted drunk. Incensed, James suspended performances at Blackfriars and had Marston imprisoned. This suggests that he was the author of the offending play. Later life After the end of his literary career, he moved into his father-in-law's house and began studying philosophy. In 1609, he became a reader at the Bodleian library at Oxford, was made a deacon on 24 September and a priest on 24 December 1609. Contemporary authors were bemused or surprised by Marston's change of career, with several of them commenting on its seeming abruptness. In October 1616, Marston was assigned the living of Christchurch, Hampshire. He died on 24 June 1634, aged 57, in London and was buried in the Middle Temple Church. Tombs at that time often started with the formulaic \\"Memoriae Sacrum\\" (\\"Sacred to the memory\\") followed by the name of the tomb's occupant and an account of their achievements even though such words are hubristic and a contradiction to the Christian virtues of modesty. According to Anthony √† Wood John Marston's tomb stone bore the legend \\"Oblivioni Sacrum\\" (\\"Sacred to Oblivion\\"), which was probably composed by Marston, and, according to Joshua Scodel, the short \\"epitaph is thus both self-abasing and witty in its novel inversion of tradition\\". Reception and criticism Marston's reputation has varied widely, like that of most of the minor Renaissance dramatists. Both The Malcontent and The Dutch Courtesan remained on stage in altered forms through the Restoration. The subplot of the latter was converted to a droll during the Commonwealth; after the Stuart Restoration, either Aphra Behn or Thomas Betterton updated the main plot for The Revenge, or The Match in Newgate, although this adaptation makes the play both more sentimental and less morally complex. Gerard Langbaine makes a laudatory but superficial comment about Marston in his survey of English dramatic poets. After the Restoration, Marston's works were largely reduced to the status of a curiosity of literary history. The general resemblance of Antonio's Revenge to Hamlet and Marston's role in the war of the poets ensured that his plays would receive some scholarly attention, but they were not performed and were not even widely read. Thomas Warton preferred Marston's satires to Bishop Hall's; in the next century, however, Henry Hallam reversed this judgment. William Gifford, perhaps the eighteenth century's most devoted reader of Jonson, called Marston \\"the most scurrilous, filthy and obscene writer of his time\\". The Romantic movement in English literature resuscitated Marston's reputation, albeit unevenly. In his lectures, William Hazlitt praised Marston's genius for satire; however, if the romantic critics and their successors were willing to grant Marston's best work a place among the great accomplishments of the period, they remained aware of his inconsistency, what Swinburne in a later generation called his \\"uneven and irregular demesne\\". In the twentieth century, however, a few critics were willing to consider Marston as a writer who was very much in control of the world he creates. T. S. Eliot saw that this \\"irregular demesne\\" was a part of Marston's world and declared that \\"It is ‚Ä¶ by giving us the sense of something behind, more real than any of the personages and their action, that Marston establishes himself among the writers of genius\\".T.S.Eliot, Elizabethan Essays (London: Faber & Faber, 1934) p189‚àí90 Marston's tragic style is Senecan and although his characters may appear, on Eliot's own admission, \\"lifeless\\", they are instead used as types to convey their \\"theoretical implications\\".(Michael Scott, John Marston's Plays: Theme, Structure and Performance, 1977) Eliot in particular admired Sophonisba and saw how Marston's plays, with their apparently stylised characters and bitter portrayal of a world where virtue and honour only arouse \\"dangerous envy\\" (Sophonisba; Act 1, scene 1, line 45) in those around them, actually bring to life \\"a pattern behind the pattern into which the characters deliberately involve themselves: the kind of pattern which we perceive in our own lives only at rare moments of inattention and detachment\\".T.S.

After more than a decade of activity and performance, notably as a leading bassist in free jazz, Grimes completely disappeared from the music scene by 1970. Grimes was often presumed to have died, but he was discovered in 2002 and returned to performing. Early life and performing career Henry Grimes, John Tchicai and Kresten Osgood. (2006) Henry Alonzo Grimes was born in Philadelphia, to parents who both had been musicians in their youth. He took up the violin at the age of 12, then began playing tuba, English horn, percussion, finally switching to the double bass at Mastbaum Technical High School. He furthered his musical studies at Juilliard and established a reputation as a versatile bassist by the mid-1950s. He recorded or performed with saxophonists Gerry Mulligan, Sonny Rollins, pianist Thelonious Monk, singer Anita O'Day, clarinetist Benny Goodman and many others. At a time when bassist Charles Mingus was experimenting with a second bass player in his band, Grimes was the person he selected for the job. One of his earliest appearances on film is captured in the Bert Stern documentary on the Newport Jazz Festival of 1958, Jazz on a Summer's Day. Grimes was 22 years old, and as word spread among the musicians about his extraordinary playing, he ended up playing with six different groups in the festival that weekend: those of Benny Goodman, Lee Konitz, Thelonious Monk, Gerry Mulligan, Sonny Rollins, and Tony Scott. And though Henry‚Äôs name never even appeared in the festival‚Äôs printed program, New York Times critic Bosley Crowther took note of the remarkable young bassist and listed him as one of the festival‚Äôs primary players. Gradually growing interested in the burgeoning free jazz movement, Grimes performed with most of the music's important names, including pianist Cecil Taylor, trumpeter Don Cherry, saxophonists Steve Lacy, Pharoah Sanders, Archie Shepp, and Albert Ayler. He released one album, The Call, as a trio leader for the ESP-Disk record label in 1965. The album features Perry Robinson on clarinet and drummer Tom Price and is considered to be representative of his career at that time. Disappearance and later return Henry Grimes. In the late 1960s, Grimes's career came to a halt after his move to California. It was commonly assumed Grimes had died; he was listed as such in several jazz reference works. Then Marshall Marrotte, a social worker and jazz fan, set out to discover Grimes's fate once and for all. In 2002, he found Grimes alive but nearly destitute, without a bass to play, renting a tiny apartment in Los Angeles, California, writing poetry and doing odd jobs to support himself. He had fallen out of touch with the jazz world and was unaware Albert Ayler had died in 1970, but was eager to perform again.Strauss, Neil (May 26, 2003), \\"Silent 30 Years, A Jazzman Resurfaces; Left New York in '68, Plays Again Tonight\\", The New York Times. Retrieved May 26, 2008. Word spread of Grimes's return, and some musicians and fans offered their help. Bassist William Parker donated a bass (nicknamed \\"Olive Oil\\" for its distinctive greenish color) and with David Gage's help had it shipped from New York to Los Angeles, and others assisted with travel expenses and arranging performances. Grimes's return was featured in The New York Times and on National Public Radio. A biography, Music to Silence to Music, was published by Northway Books in London in 2015. Making up for lost time, Grimes performed at more than two dozen music festivals or other appearances in 2003. He received a returning hero's welcome at the free jazz-oriented Vision Festival, and began teaching lessons and workshops for bassists. His November 2003 appearance on trumpeter Dennis Gonz√°lez' Nile River Suite was the bassist's second recording in more than 35 years, the first being a JazzNewYork recording of a solo concert that Grimes played on the air from WKCR-FM's studios at Columbia University in New York within weeks of his return to New York. In 2004 he recorded as leader with David Murray and Hamid Drake; and in 2005 with guitarist Marc Ribot, who also wrote an introduction to Grimes' first book, Signs Along the Road, published in March 2007 by buddy's knife jazzedition in Cologne, Germany, a collection of Grimes' poetry in which he presents his selection of entries from thousands of pages of his writings during the long years he was not playing music. Also in 2007, Grimes recorded with drummer Rashied Ali, with whom he played a half-dozen duo concerts and a trio with Marilyn Crispell, and in 2008 with Paul Dunmall and Andrew Cyrille, a co-leader trio called the Profound Sound Trio, among others. Following his return in 2003, Grimes played at many venues around New York City and on tour in the United States, Canada, and 30 countries in Europe, the Far East, and Brazil; often working as a leader, Grimes had been making music with Rashied Ali, Marshall Allen, Fred Anderson, Marilyn Crispell, Ted Curson, Andrew Cyrille, Bill Dixon, Dave Douglas, Andrew Lamb, Joe Lovano, Roscoe Mitchell, William Parker, High Priest (from Anti-Pop Consortium), Wadada Leo Smith, Cecil Taylor (with whom Grimes resumed playing in October, 2006 after 40 years), John Tchicai, and many others. In 2011, the Chelsea Art Museum hosted a re-creation of the performance Black Zero, a happening created in the 1960s by pioneering media artist Aldo Tambellini. Tambellini performed the multi- media piece on several occasions between 1965 and 1968, often in collaboration with jazz musicians such as Bill Dixon and Cecil McBee. The performance at the Chelsea Art Museum was produced by Swiss conceptual artist Christoph Draeger, who invited Grimes to join. Grimes played with Ben Morea, accompanying simultaneous slide and film projections by Aldo Tambellini and sound recordings of the late Calvin Hernton's radical poetry.\\"Back In The New York Groove!\\" . Retrieved December 10, 2011. In all, between Henry Grimes's return to the music world in 2003 and his 80th year, 2016, he played more than 640 concerts, including many festivals, in 30 countries. In his last years, Grimes also held a number of residencies and offered workshops and master classes on major campuses, including City College of New York, Berklee College of Music, Hamilton College, New England Conservatory, the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, the University of Gloucestershire at Cheltenham, Humber College, and more. He released or played on a dozen new recordings, made his professional debut on a second instrument (the violin) at Cecil Taylor's side at Lincoln Center at the age of 70, and had been creating illustrations to accompany his new recordings and publications. Grimes received many honors in recent years, including four Meet the Composer grants. He can be heard on nearly 90 recordings on various labels, including Atlantic, Ayler Records, Blue Note, Columbia, ESP-Disk, ILK Music, Impulse!, JazzNewYork Productions, Pi Recordings, Porter Records, Prestige, Riverside, and Verve. Grimes was a resident of New York City and had a busy schedule of performances, clinics, and international tours. On June 7, 2016, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from Arts for Art/Vision Festival on opening day at Judson Memorial Church in New York City. He stopped performing in 2018, with the relentless progression of the effects of Parkinson‚Äôs disease causing severe disabilities. Death Henry Grimes died on April 15, 2020, at the age of 84 from complications of COVID-19. The date of his death and its cause were confirmed by his wife, Margaret Davis-Grimes, to the Jazz Foundation of America.

The patronymic is sometimes rendered Fitz Piers, for he was the son of Piers de Lutegareshale (born 1134, Cherhill, Wiltshire, died 14 Jan 1179, Pleshy, Essex), a forester of Ludgershall & Maud de Manderville (1138, Rycott, Oxford, England). Life He was from a modest landowning family that had a tradition of service in mid-ranking posts under Henry II. Geoffrey's elder brother Simon Fitz Peter was at various times High Sheriff of Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, and Bedfordshire. Geoffrey, too, got his start in this way, as High Sheriff of Northamptonshire for the last five years of Henry II's reign. Around this time Geoffrey married Beatrice de Say, daughter and eventual co-heiress of William de Say II. This William was the elder son of William de Say I and Beatrice, sister of Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex. This connection with the Mandeville family was later to prove unexpectedly important. In 1184 Geoffrey's father-in-law died, and he received a share of the de Say inheritance by right of his wife, co-heiress to her father. He also eventually gained the title of earl of Essex by right of his wife, becoming the 4th earl. When Richard I left on crusade, he appointed Geoffrey one of the five judges of the king's court, and thus a principal advisor to Hugh de Puiset, Bishop of Durham, who, as Chief Justiciar, was one of the regents during the king's absence. Late in 1189, Geoffrey's wife's cousin William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex died, leaving no direct heirs. His wife's inheritance was disputed between Geoffrey and Beatrice's uncle, Geoffrey de Say, but Geoffrey Fitz Peter used his political influence to eventually obtain the Mandeville lands (although not the earldom, which was left open) for himself. He served as Constable of the Tower of London from 1198 to 1205. He served as High Sheriff of Yorkshire from 1198 to 1201 and again in 1203 and as High Sheriff of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire from 1200 to 1205. On 11 July 1198, King Richard appointed Geoffrey Chief Justiciar, which at that time effectively made him the king's principal minister. On his coronation day the new king ennobled Geoffrey as Earl of Essex. King John granted Berkhamsted Castle to Geoffrey; the castle had previously been granted as a jointure palace to Queen Isabel prior to the annulment of the royal marriage. Geoffrey founded two hospitals in Berkhamsted, one dedicated to St John the Baptist and one to St John the Evangelist; the latter is still commemorated in the town with the name St John's Well Lane. After the accession of King John, Geoffrey continued in his capacity as the king's principal minister until his death on 14 October 1213.Powicke Handbook of British Chronology p. 70 Marriage and issue Spouses *m1.

Hirsch, Jr., Joseph F. Kett, and James Trefil, Houghton Mifflin Company, 2002. The term \\"make- work\\" is sometimes used as a synonym for featherbedding. The term \\"featherbedding\\" is usually used by management to describe behaviors and rules sought by workers.William Gomberg, \\"Featherbedding: An Assertion of Property Rights,\\" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 333:1 (1961). The term may equally apply to mid- and upper-level management, particularly in regard to top-heavy and \\"bloated\\" levels of middle- and upper- level management.\\"Featherbedding Brass,\\" Time, May 14, 1956; C.A. Myers, \\"Top Management Featherbedding?\\", Sloan Management Review, 24:4 (1983). Featherbedding has also been occasionally used to describe rent-seeking behavior by corporations in response to economic regulation.Jarita Duasa and Paul Mosley, \\"Capital Controls Re-examined: The Case for 'Smart' Controls,\\" The World Economy, 29:9 (September 2006). Etymology The term \\"featherbedding\\" originally referred to any person who is pampered, coddled, or excessively rewarded. The term originated in the use of feathers to fill mattresses in beds, providing for more comfort. The modern use of the term in the labor relations setting began in the United States railroad industry, which used feathered mattresses in sleeping cars. Railway labor unions, confronted with changing technology which led to widespread unemployment, sought to preserve jobs by negotiating contracts which required employers to compensate workers to do little or no work or which required complex and time- consuming work rules so as to generate a full day's work for an employee who otherwise would not remain employed.Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law, 1st ed., Merriam-Webster, Inc., 1996. In a 1965 bulletin the United States Department of Labor referred to \\"featherbedding\\" as: Since the mid-19th century, \\"featherbedding\\" has been most commonly used in the labor relations field. Increasingly, the term has come to refer only to work rules or collective bargaining agreements demanded by labor unions.Norman J. Simler, \\"The Economics of Featherbedding\\", in Featherbedding and Technological Change, ed. by Paul Weinstein, D.C. Heath and Co., 1965. In nations where trade union activities are legally defined, legal definitions of featherbedding exist. These definitions are few in number, and tend to be narrowly drawn. For example, the Taft-Hartley Act in the United States defines featherbedding in Section 8(b)(6) as any agreement or union demand for payment of wages for services which are not performed or not to be performed. However, in 1953, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the Act's definition only applies to payments for workers not to work. Therefore, work rules requiring minimum crew sizes, the assignment of duties to craft workers, and other \\"make-work\\" agreements do not constitute featherbedding.American Newspaper Publishers Association v. National Labor Relations Board, 345 U.S. 100 (1953). Economics Featherbedding is commonly seen by economists as a solution to \\"who should bear the burden of technological change?\\"Paul A. Weinstein, \\"The Featherbedding Problem,\\" American Economic Review, 54:3 (May, 1964). Labor economists often argue that featherbedding can be construed as the most economically optimal position from both an employer's and employee's perspective, since it can be seen as distributing the costs of technological change.Adam Seth Litwin, \\"Not featherbedding, but feathering the nest: Human resource management and investments in information technology.\\" Industrial Relations: A Journal of Economy and Society 52.1 (2013): 23. \\"However, from a labor economist‚Äôs perspective, employment relations structures and processes were simply spreading the cost associated with technological change by constraining the degree to and the speed with which capital-labor ratios could be adjusted.\\" Featherbedding only emerges under certain circumstances. Chief among these is that the employer has an exploitable surplus (e.g., profit) to support the practice. Featherbedding also arises where market forces fail and organizations are permitted to be noncompetitive. Under this analysis, corporations (for example) are already inefficient and featherbedding does not make them more or less so. Featherbedding can, in some circumstances, take excess resources (profits) away from the employer and give them to workers in the form of more income per worker or higher numbers of employees at the same income level. Featherbedding is considered economically efficient because it occurs in the give-and-take of collective bargaining. If employers were relatively strong vis-a-vis unions, unions would be unable to impose featherbedding on them. As the politico-socio-economic strength of each party changes over time, collective bargaining outcomes will as well, enlarging or reducing the number and impact of featherbedding rules on the employer.Lloyd Ulman, The Rise of the National Trade Union, Harvard University Press, 1955; Clarence C. Morrison and Herbert J. Kiesling, \\"Featherbedding‚ÄîAn Easy Second Best Problem,\\" Atlantic Economic Journal, 4:3 (September 1976).Henry S. Farber, \\"The analysis of union behavior,\\" Handbook of labor economics 2 (1986): 1039‚Äì89. More recent political analyses of featherbedding have concluded that featherbedding is not necessarily economically optimal, but is better than other forms of bargaining. Under this analysis, the best form of collective bargaining would be one in which the union and employer bargain not only over wages but the level of employment. Most unions in the United States, for example, bargain solely over wages. Bargaining over work rules (featherbedding) as well as wages achieves outcomes close to those reached by bargaining solely over wages, but is better than bargaining over wages alone.George E. Johnson, \\"Work Rules, Featherbedding, and Pareto-Optimal Union Management Bargaining,\\" Journal of Labor Economics, 8:1 (Part 2, 1990). Non- economic perspectives Legal scholars and certain social theorists argue that featherbedding may be an expression of the concept of a job as a property right. These analysts argue that while the owner or employer has the \\"right\\" to extract profit because of his or her investment of capital, so the worker has the \\"right\\" to extract profit because of his or her investment of labor. Featherbedding, it is argued, arises and becomes a significant problem in places where the job property right is not part of the legal regime and remains unprotected (such as the United States).Donald L. Martin, \\"Job Property Rights and Job Defections,\\" Journal of Law and Economics, 15:2 (October 1972); P.J. White, \\"Unfair Dismissal Legislation and Property Rights: Some Reflections,\\" Industrial Relations Journal, 16:4 (December 1985); Ellen Dannin, \\"Why At-Will Employment Is Bad For Employers and Just Cause Is Good For Them,\\" Labor Law Journal, 58:5 (2007). Seizing on economists' emphasis on power in the workplace, other social theorists conclude that featherbedding is a result of weak labor unions and unenforced and unprotected worker rights. Under this analysis, featherbedding is a response by unions to their weakness, not strength. Improved workplace employment rights, improved economic policies and less antagonistic labor-management relations, it is argued, would reduce featherbedding. Others see certain kinds of featherbedding as a corrective for market failures. For example, the delivery of social services is often not quantifiable except in the extreme. When the market is unable to quantify a good or service, the market will fail to accurately price it. Market failure results. In complex organizations, or in those whose inputs and outputs are difficult to quantify, it becomes increasingly difficult to determine what constitutes featherbedding.Charles Perrow, Complex Organizations: A Critical Essay, Scott, Foresman & Co., 1979. For example, defining \\"quality health care\\" is problematic,Evert Reerink, \\"Defining Quality of Care: Mission Impossible?\\", International Journal for Quality in Health Care, 2 (1990); Rick L. Nevers, \\"Defining Quality Is Difficult, But Necessary,\\" Healthcare Financial Management, February 1993; Philip Caper, \\"Defining Quality in Medical Care,\\" Health Affairs, Spring 1988. as is defining a \\"quality education\\".Hans F. Crombag, \\"On Defining Quality of Education,\\" Journal Higher Education, 7:4 (November 1978); Alisa Belzer, ed., Toward Defining and Improving Quality in Adult Basic Education: Issues and Challenges, 1st ed., Lawrence Erlbaum, 2007. ; Eric A.

In such situations, frontline professional workers place heavy emphasis on work rules and minimums. Many white-collar professionals (in particular those such as nurses and teachers) and highly skilled craft workers place heavy emphasis on staffing minimums, for example, as a means of ensuring a \\"high quality\\" outcome.\\"Nurses and hospitals are increasingly agreeing that various departments have a minimum number of nurses, and teachers' contracts are specifying maximum class sizes, in effect guaranteeing that school districts have a minimum number of teachers for the student population.\\" Steven Greenhouse, \\"Big Audience Guaranteed For This Labor Dispute,\\" New York Times, March 9, 2003. While some argue that this is an exercise in the professional judgment of such workers,Virginia Cleland, \\"The Professional Model,\\" American Journal of Nursing, 75:2 (February 1975); David Lewin and Bruce Kaufman, eds., New Research on Labor Relations and the Performance of University HR/IR Programs, 1st ed., JAI Press, 2000. others call this featherbedding and point to the low level of evidence that such rules improve outcomes.Jess B. Weiss, \\"Perspectives: An Anesthesiologist,\\" Health Affairs, Fall 1988. International perspectives Brazil In Brazil, featherbedding is considered endemic in government-owned and private-sector industries. Some analysts argue that featherbedding is a reaction to economic insecurity, and helps stabilize the national economy by spreading wealth.M. Delal Baer, \\"Profiles in Transition in Latin America and the Caribbean,\\" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 526 (March 1993); William F. Maloney, \\"Informality Revisited,\\" World Development, 32:7 (July 2004). France In France, featherbedding was encouraged by the nationalized rail transportation system after World War Two with a view to keeping down the unemployment rate. This was in addition to railway express rates being kept very low. The railroad ran at a huge deficit as a result.De Gramont, Sanche, The French, Portrait of a People, G. P. Putman's Sons, New York, 1969, p. 440 Japan In post-war Japan, featherbedding is uncommon. A post-war consensus emerged among labor unions that featherbedding was not in the best interest of workers, and unions in Japan have tended to avoid the practice. A heavy government emphasis on full employment and a strong social safety net helped reinforce this consensus.Thomas J. DiLorenzo, \\"Japanese Labor Relations: Are There Lessons for the U.S.?\\", Journal Journal of Labor Research, 11:3 (September, 1990). Sweden There are no national, regional, or local statutes or regulations governing labor unions in Sweden. Sweden has no national bureau or agency overseeing or regulating labor relations, and no agency monitors or regulates internal trade union matters. Nevertheless, despite relatively close relationships between employers and unions, featherbedding is almost unknown in Sweden.Reinhold Fahlbeck, Trade Unionism in Sweden, International Institute for Labour Studies, International Labour Organization, 1999. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, featherbedding is also referred to as \\"overmanning\\".George E. Johnson, \\"Work Rules, Featherbedding, and Pareto-Optimal Union-Management Bargaining,\\" Journal of Labor Economics, 8:1 (Part 2; January 1990). United States In the U.S., the Taft-Hartley Act defines and outlaws featherbedding.\\"Featherbedding and Taft-Hartley,\\" Columbia Law Review, 52:8 (December 1952). However, as previously noted, the U.S. Supreme Court has narrowly defined featherbedding, leaving most practices undisturbed.

It is located in Jung-gu between Seoul Station and Seoul Plaza, with the historic 24-hour Namdaemun Market next to the gate. The gate, dating back to the 14th century, is a historic pagoda-style gateway, and is designated as the first National Treasure of South Korea. It was once one of the three major gateways through Seoul's city walls which had a stone circuit of and stood up to high. It was first built in the last year of King Taejo of Joseon's reign in 1398, and rebuilt in 1447. In 2008, the wooden pagoda atop the gate was severely damaged by arson. Restoration work on the gateway started in February 2010 and was completed on 29 April 2013. The gate was reopened on 4 May 2013. Name The South Korean government, as written in hanja on the wooden structure, officially calls the landmark Sungnyemun, even though it has been more commonly known as Namdaemun () since the Joseon dynasty. Most of people are thinking the name ‚ÄúNamdaemun‚Äù was changed forcibly by the Japanese Empire (colonial period) and arguing that it should not be used. However, by following the annals of the Joseon Dynasty, naming and calling the 8 gates with the direction were slang terms. Thus, even though they were slang, they've never been vestiges of the Japanese Colonial era. Different from the other gates, Sungnyemun's tablet has its name written vertically. When the first king of the Joseon dynasty, Yi Seonggye (who reigned from 1335 to 1408), constructed the capital city, he believed that fire would reach to Gyeongbokgung Palace, as well as to the capital city, as Mt. Gwanaksan of Seoul is shaped like fire according to feng shui principles. Sungnyemun's name means \\"fire\\", which is from the harmony of the Five Elements and, if written vertically, the Chinese character \\"fire\\" looks as if it is providing protection. This was Taejong's (1367‚Äì1422) first son, Yangnyeongdaegun's (1394-1462), famous writing. History Before the 2008 fire Before the 2008 fire, Namdaemun was the oldest wooden structure in Seoul. The city gate, made of wood and stone with a two-tiered, pagoda-shaped tiled roof, was completed in 1398 and originally used to greet foreign emissaries, control access to the capital city, and keep out Siberian tigers, which have long been gone from the area. Construction began in 1395 during the fourth year of the reign of King Taejo of Joseon and was finished in 1398. The structure was rebuilt in 1447, during the 29th year of King Sejong the Great's reign, and has been renovated several times since. It was originally one of three main gates, the others being the East Gate (Dongdaemun) and the now- demolished West Gate in the Seodaemun-gu district, named after the old gate. In the early part of the 20th century, the city walls that surrounded Seoul were demolished to make the traffic system more efficient. A visit to Seoul by the Crown Prince of Japan prompted the demolition of the walls around Namdaemun, as the prince was deemed to be too exalted to pass through the gateway. The gate was closed to the public in 1907 after the authority constructed an electric tramway nearby. In 1938, Namdaemun was designated as Korean Treasure No. 1 by the Governor-General of Korea. Namdaemun was extensively damaged during the Korean War and was given its last major repair in 1961, with a completion ceremony held on 14 May 1963. It was given the status of \\"National Treasure No. 1\\" on 20 December 1962. The gate was renovated again in 2005 with the building of a lawn around the gate, before being opened once again to the public with much fanfare on 3 March 2006. During the restoration, 182 pages of blueprints for the gate were made as a contingency against any emergencies which may damage the structure. Three years later, such an emergency arose. 2008 fire At approximately 8:50 p.m. on 10 February 2008, a fire broke out and severely damaged the wooden structure at the top of the Namdaemun gate. The fire roared out of control again after midnight and finally destroyed the structure, despite the efforts of more than 360 firefighters. Many witnesses reported seeing a suspicious man shortly before the fire, and two disposable lighters were found where the fire was believed to have started. A 69-year-old man identified as Chae Jong-gi was arrested on suspicion of arson and later confessed to the crime. A police captain reported that Chae had sprayed paint thinner on the floor of the structure and then set fire to it. Police say that Chae was upset about not being paid in full for land he had sold to developers. The same man had been charged with setting a fire at Changgyeong Palace in Seoul in 2006. Restoration The Cultural Heritage Administration of South Korea said that it would undertake a three-year project that would cost an estimated ‚Ç©20 billion (approximately $14 million) to rebuild and restore the historic gate, making it the most expensive restoration project in South Korea. President Lee Myung-bak proposed starting a private donation campaign to finance the restoration of the structure. By January 2010, 70% of the pavilion gate, the first floor and 80% of the fortress wall had been completed. Work on the roof began in April after the completion of the wooden second floor, with 22,000 roof tiles produced in a traditional kiln in Buyeo, South Chungcheong Province. The wall and basic frame were scheduled to be finished in April and May respectively. The pillars and rafters are to be elaborately decorated, with the ornamental patterns and colors based on those used in the large-scale repair in 1963, which was closest to the early-Chosun original. In January 2013, it was estimated by an official that restoration of the gate would be completed around May 2013. Construction had been delayed by four months due to harsh weather conditions in Seoul. On 17 February 2013, the gate was 96% completed, and all steel-frame scaffolding had been removed. On 29 April 2013, restoration work was completed, and the public opening was scheduled for 4 May 2013, a day before Children's Day. It was officially reopened on 5 May 2013, after a five-year restoration period. Only six months after the restoration was completed, paint started to chip off and wood cracked. President Park Geun-hye ordered an investigation into the matter.

The band's classic lineup consisted of Vaden Todd Lewis (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Lisa Umbarger (bass guitar), Darrel Herbert (lead guitar), and Mark Reznicek (drums). It formed in 1989 and disbanded in 2001 after Umbarger left the group. The band reformed and released the album No Deliverance in 2008. In 2010, they re-released the album Feeler with Kirtland Records (the album's original release had been denied by Interscope in 1997). The band's most recent album, The Lower Side of Uptown, was released in September 2017. Biography Early years, Rubberneck, and commercial breakthrough (1989‚Äì1996) Toadies began in 1989 in Fort Worth, Texas. It recorded a few cassette self-releases and an E.P. titled Pleather before signing to Interscope Records. Its first full-length album Rubberneck was released in the summer of 1994. Featuring a sound described as \\"distinctly grunge\\" and \\"distinctly Texan\\", Rubberneck included six singles, \\"Possum Kingdom\\", \\"Mister Love\\", \\"Away\\", \\"Tyler\\", \\"Backslider\\" and \\"I Come From the Water\\". \\"Backslider\\" can be heard in the film Black Sheep. \\"Possum Kingdom\\" would later become a playable track in the Xbox 360 version of Guitar Hero II. Toadies toured extensively throughout the 1990s supporting Rubberneck, opening for artists such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, White Zombie, Bush, and The Butthole Surfers. The band also headlined and co-headlined tours with acts such as Supersuckers, and The Reverend Horton Heat. Toadies were a regular act at the festivals Edgefest in Dallas, and Buzzfest in Houston during these years. Feeler sessions, Hell Below/Stars Above, and breakup (1997‚Äì2002) The band entered the studio in 1997 to record new tracks for a second album, Feeler. Interscope Records did not approve the finished product, and rejected its 1998 release. In 2000, they went back to the studio, salvaged some of the songs from the Feeler sessions, and released their second full-length album Hell Below/Stars Above in the spring of 2001. Portland-based musician Elliott Smith performed piano backup for the title track. Hell Below/Stars Above was not promoted by Interscope, and saw poor sales. The band toured in the spring and summer of 2001 in support of the new album, until bassist Lisa Umbarger unexpectedly resigned from the band in July 2001. Umbarger told the Dallas Observer that she resigned after realizing that Interscope Records was not going to promote the band. Vaden Todd Lewis decided to break up the band rather than continue without her, a decision which \\"stunned\\" Umbarger. The band played a few farewell shows later that summer, with Mark Hughes filling in for Umbarger, before parting ways. Shortly after the break-up, a live album, Best of Toadies: Live from Paradise, was released. It was recorded earlier in 2001 at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston, MA. The album was released through Interscope Records, but Kirtland Records later picked up the band's back catalogue. No Deliverance, Feeler release, and Play.Rock.Music (2006‚Äì2013) Toadies reformed for a reunion show on March 11, 2006, headlining the Greenville Avenue St. Patrick's Day parade concert. In March 2007, they embarked on a mini-tour, playing dates in Austin, Houston, and Dallas. The final show of the mini-tour was recorded and released as the live album Rock Show. The band released its third studio album, No Deliverance, on August 19, 2008, via Kirtland Records. The lead single for the album was the title track. Toadies performed at Lollapalooza on August 2, 2008, Wildflower! Arts and Music Festival on May 16, 2009 and May 18, 2013, and Austin City Limits Music Festival on October 4, 2009. In addition, on August 31, 2008, the Toadies headlined the inaugural Dia De Los Toadies, an annual Texas music festival organized by and featuring the band. In June 2010 it was announced that Feeler, the follow-up album to Rubberneck that was shelved by Interscope, would finally be seeing a release. Vaden Todd Lewis was quoted as saying: \\"Since there are unfinished versions floating around on the Internet, it is important to us that people hear it as we meant it to be.\\" The band was unable to obtain the original 1997 Feeler masters from Interscope, and re-recorded the album in 2010. The album was released on July 20, 2010. The band's fifth album, Play.Rock.Music, was released July 31, 2012 on Kirtland Records. A promotional video for the track, \\"Summer of the Strange,\\" can be viewed on Clark Vogeler's YouTube channel. Philadelphia, PA during the Rubberneck 20th Anniversary Tour. Rubberneck 20th-anniversary reissue and tour (2014) On January 7, 2014, the Toadies announced via its Facebook page that its Rubberneck album would be reissued by Kirtland Records with five previously- unreleased bonus tracks. The announcement also revealed plans for a nationwide Rubberneck 20-year anniversary tour, featuring the Toadies playing the entire Rubberneck album \\"front to back\\", with supporting acts Supersuckers and Battleme. The tour ended in September 2014 with a final Rubberneck start to finish performance, followed by performances of the band's more recent songs, at the seventh annual Dia De Los Toadies festival in Fort Worth. Heretics and Summerland Tour (2015) In January 2015, Everclear announced its fourth annual multi-city Summerland Tour via Twitter. The 2015 Summerland Tour featured Everclear and Toadies, as well as alt-rock bands American Hi-Fi and Fuel. In June 2015, Toadies announced that its eighth album, Heretics, would be released September 18. The album \\"re-imagines and reinterprets\\" several Toadies songs such as \\"Possum Kingdom\\" and \\"Backslider,\\" and featured two new songs and a cover of Blondie's 1979 single \\"Heart of Glass\\". The Toadies also launched a new tour to promote Heretics in the fall of 2015, with the tour starting at the eighth annual Dia De Los Toadies music festival in September 2015. The Lower Side Of Uptown and Tour (2017) The Toadies released its ninth album, The Lower Side Of Uptown on September 8, 2017 via Kirtland Records. On September 6, 2017, band members kicked off their fall tour with Local H in Denton, Texas.

The Inducer causes the gene to turn on (controlled by the amount of reactant which turns the gene on). Then there's the repressor protein that turns genes off.

The operator is a section of DNA where the repressor binds to shut off certain genes; the promoter is the section of DNA where the RNA polymerase binds. Lastly, the regulatory gene is the gene for the repressor protein.

Between 2013 and 2018, he was a contributor and host at Sky News Live, including a controversial stint as a co-host of Outsiders, before his employment was terminated for racist remarks made on air. Early life The son of Jim Cameron, a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, he was born in Sydney, New South Wales, grew up in Turramurra in Sydney and was educated at Knox Grammar School and Sydney University. He was a lawyer before entering politics. He was policy adviser and research officer to the New South Wales Minister for Transport, Bruce Baird, and an intern to United States Republican Senator Mark Hatfield.  Member of Parliament  Cameron was elected to parliament in the 1996 Federal election, winning the Division of Parramatta from the sitting Labor member Paul Elliott. A noted orator, he delivered his maiden speech to the House of Representatives without notes. Cameron held the traditionally Labor seat of Parramatta for three terms. While a member of parliament, Cameron was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services from 2001‚Äì2003 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Peter Costello) 2003‚Äì2004. Cameron ran regular prayer meetings for politicians in his office in Parliament House. He has also been associated with the American evangelical Christian organisation, The Fellowship. Mark Latham wrote of Ross Cameron in 1997: \\"Ross Cameron, the brilliant but creepy Liberal member for Parramatta, has talked me into participating in his youth leadership forum in Canberra. I rather suspect it's a front for mobilising Christian soldiers, plus some quality box for Ross\\". Cameron ran an eight-year campaign while in office against the Parliament House contemporary art collection. Extramarital affair In August 2004, Cameron revealed in an interview in Good Weekend that he had an extramarital affair with an \\"exotic solicitor\\" while his wife was pregnant with twins. Cameron \\"was a frequent overnight visitor to the house his mistress shared with a reporter\\". In Truth Overboard, journalist Tom Dusevic wrote in Time magazine that once Cameron's story was in the public domain \\"...reporters in Canberra immediately ran with further details of Cameron's private life, unleashing stories they'd been sitting on for years\\" which included accounts of numerous other affairs which he had failed to disclose in the original interview with Good Weekend.\\"The former flatmate of the woman yesterday recalled Mr Cameron showering and dressing himself in the bathroom of the apartment on at least two occasions in winter 2001. At other times, Mr Cameron could be found in the kitchen making coffee. The MP was unaware his lover shared the apartment with a reporter. At the time of the affair the woman worked as a Commonwealth DPP solicitor. She has moved to Washington. The pair hit it off when Mr Cameron revealed he had trained as a solicitor and worked for top firm Blake Dawson Waldron. \\"How MP betrayed his pregnant wife Telegraph 17 August 2004 The admission was considered to be the main reason why he lost his seat at the 2004 Federal election.Scandal MP Ross Cameron plans a return to politics, The Daily Telegraph, 14 September 2011 He was one of only three sitting coalition members to lose their seat at that election.

In July 2014, Cameron became a co-host alongside Kristina Keneally on weekly panel show The Contrarians every Friday afternoon, before the pair were given their own self-titled program Keneally and Cameron. This program was axed in March 2015. From 4 December 2016, Cameron began co-hosting Outsiders on Sky News. On a Sky News panel discussion of the Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape in October 2016, Cameron said the whole thing had made him even more pro-Trump and theatrically demonstrated his support by donning an official Trump slogan cap and removing his shirt to reveal an official Trump Pence campaign t-shirt. In February 2017, Cameron was reported to have spoken as a VIP member at a fundraiser for the far-right Q Society of Australia. In the article, his speech was characterised by having \\"constantly mentioned homosexuality\\", and is quoted to have said \\"The NSW division of the Liberal Party is basically a gay club... I don't mind that they are gay, I just wish, like Hadrian, they would build a wall.\\" His comments were condemned by Sky News colleagues including David Speers, Peter van Onselen and Kristina Keneally. Also in February 2017, Cameron was suspended by the Liberal Party's NSW state executive for four-and- a-half years, after he gave an interview to the ABC's 7.30 Report in which he referred to Liberal Party processes as \\"corrupt\\" and called the party \\"basically a gay club\\". Cameron was sacked by Sky News on 2 November 2018, after making racist remarks on Outsiders.

The postal clerk should have rejected this cover, but instead the foreign stamps received US postmarks. From left to right, the stamps are from Austria, Germany, Ivory Coast, French Guiana, United States, and French India. A philatelic cover is an envelope prepared with a stamp(s) and address and sent through the mail delivery system for the purpose of creating a collectible item. Stamp collectors began to send mail to each other and to themselves early on, and philatelic mail is known from the late 19th century onward. While some collectors specialize in philatelic covers, especially first day covers and cacheted covers, others regard them as contrived objects that are not reflective of real-world usage, and often will pay a higher price for a cover that represents genuine commercial use. However, mail sent by stamp collectors is no less a genuine article of postage than is mail sent with no concern of seeing the mailed item again. Philatelic covers include mail from first airmail flight and first day of stamp issues ceremonies. Over the years there have been numerous Expositions where special postmarks are made and where a post office is set up where mail can be sent from on the given date of the Expo'. Like any other genuine item of mail these covers include postage stamps and postmarks of the time period and were processed and delivered by an official postal system. Often a philatelic cover will have more historical significance than randomly mailed covers as philatelic covers are also often mailed from the location on the date of an important or noteworthy event, like an inauguration or a space launch. Types Last day of service cover from the discontinued post office at Officer, Colorado The possible kinds of philatelic covers are only limited by the imagination of creative collectors, but there are a number of well-known categories: * First day covers, mailed on the first day of issue of a stamp. * Cacheted covers, sent on envelopes with additional artwork, usually relating to the theme of the stamp. * Covers with special or commemorative cancellations used temporarily by a post office. * Covers with cancellations from unusual places. * Covers sent to collect particular postal markings. * \\"One of everything\\" cover, all stamps of a new or old issue affixed to the cover. * Unnecessary mixed frankings. * Last day of service of a discontinued post office Identifying philatelic covers Not all philatelic covers are as obvious as this one. Philatelic covers are normally very easy to spot but sometimes they can escape detection by the inexperienced philatelist. Characteristics include: *The cover is still sealed and appears to be empty. *The stamps used are far above that needed for the postal service used. *The cover is addressed to a well known dealer. *The stamps include a full set of one particular issue, possibly applied in order of value. *The stamps are applied very tidily and/or the postmark appears to have been very carefully applied so as not to obscure too much of the stamps. *The cover bears a cachet or special design, usually on the left side portion of the envelope. *The address consists of a small rubber stamp or adhesive label in the bottom right hand corner of the cover. *The cover has a rarely seen combination of stamps, for instance with stamps that were issued many years apart. While many philatelists prefer genuine commercial covers to philatelically contrived covers, philatelic covers may still be acceptable in collections of countries and eras where few other covers exist. Whether the cover was contrived or not, it is still an item of mail sent through the same postal system as other covers from a given country, with a postage stamp(s) and postmark, and is often more historically significant than covers set with no intention of recovery. Famous philatelic covers Various types of covers, usually prepared by collectors, historians or other enthusiasts, have great historical significance and, regardless of the intention for the mailed item, are sometimes noteworthy or famous in their own right. Zeppelin mail Among the most definitive examples of famous or popular philatelic covers is Zeppelin mail. These are covers that were carried aboard zeppelins in the 1930s and bear special postmarks and other special markings. Because the new Zeppelins were the fastest way to get mail delivered across the Atlantic Ocean they carried a great deal of mail. Because of all the fanfare surrounding the Zeppelins most of mail carried aboard were Zeppelin first flight covers. Much of the funding for the Zeppelin delivery system was generated by collectors and other enthusiasts of the period. Because of the fast mail delivery service there was a lot of commercial mail aboard these vessels. Mail service across the Atlantic Ocean was reduced from weeks to a few days. Hindenburg‚Äôs 2-1/2 day service was the fastest way to send mail between Europe and North America in 1936.Airships: The Hindenburg and other Zeppelins First Flight mail An A.C. Roessler cover carried on the first scheduled U.S. Air Mail flight from Washington DC to New York City, May 15, 1918. With the advent of air travel it wasn't long before airplanes were carrying the mail between distant points about the globe. In the United States and Germany Air Mail delivery was greeted with the same national enthusiasm and fanfare as was experienced with the first trips to the moon by US Astronauts. Consequently, many people sent philatelic mail to themselves or friends that was carried aboard these flights in order to get a souvenir of the historic event. First flight covers carried aboard are very popular and famous in some cases. The first scheduled U.S. Air Mail service began on May 15, 1918, and carried mail from Washington DC to New York City. The type of airplane used was the U.S. Army Curtiss JN-4 \\"Jenny\\" biplanes flown by army pilots with an intermediate stop in Philadelphia (Bustleton Field). Among those who were on hand for the departure of the first flight from Washington, D.C., were President Woodrow Wilson, U.S. Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson, and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. Army Lt. George L. Boyle was selected to pilot aircraft #38262 on the first Northbound flight which, unfortunately, turned out to be a somewhat less than successful initial venture.Jones, A.D.

Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated by 11 young naval officers. The following trial and popular support of the Japanese population led to extremely light sentences for the assassins, strengthening the rising power of Japanese militarism and weakening democracy and the rule of law in the Empire of Japan. Background As a result of the ratification of the London Naval Treaty limiting the size of the Imperial Japanese Navy, a movement grew within the junior officer corps to overthrow the government, and to replace it with military rule. This movement had parallels in the Sakurakai secret society organized within the Imperial Japanese Army. The naval officers established contacts with the ultranationalist Inoue Nissho and his \\"League of Blood\\", and agreed with his philosophy that to bring about a \\"Sh≈çwa Restoration\\", it would be necessary to assassinate leading political and business figures. In March 1932, in the \\"League of Blood Incident\\", Inoue's group only managed to kill former Finance Minister and head of the Rikken Minseit≈ç, Inoue Junnosuke, and Director-General of Mitsui Holding Company, Takuma Dan. Incident Sh≈´mei ≈åkawa On May 15, 1932, the naval officers, aided by army cadets, and right- wing civilian elements (including Sh≈´mei ≈åkawa, Mitsuru T≈çyama, and Kosaburo Tachibana) staged their own attempt to complete what had been started in the League of Blood Incident. Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was shot by eleven young naval officers (most were just turning twenty years of age) in the prime minister's residence. Inukai's last words were roughly to which his killers replied .Toland, The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire, 1936‚Äì1945 The original assassination plan had included killing the English film star Charlie Chaplin who had arrived in Japan on May 14, 1932, at a reception for Chaplin, planned by Prime Minister Inukai. \\"These activists, eager to ingest a nativist Yamato spirit into politics, recognised the charged political nature of mass culture\\". Chaplin's murder would facilitate war with the U.S., and anxiety in Japan, and lead on to \\"restoration\\" in the name of the emperor.Erotic Grotesque Nonsense:The Mass Culture of Japanese Modern Times, p.1 - Miriam Silverberg, 2006 Univ of California Press. When the prime minister was killed, his son Inukai Takeru was watching a sumo wrestling match with Charlie Chaplin, which probably saved both their lives. The insurgents also attacked the residence of Makino Nobuaki, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, head of the Rikken Seiy≈´kai political party, and tossed hand-grenades into Mitsubishi Bank headquarters in Tokyo, and several electrical transformer substations. Aside from the murder of the prime minister, the attempted coup d'√©tat came to nothing, and the rebellion as a whole proved a failure. The participants took a taxi to the police headquarters and surrendered themselves to the Kempeitai without a struggle. Consequences The 11 murderers of Prime Minister Inukai were court-martialed. During the proceedings, the accused used the trial as a platform to proclaim their loyalty to the emperor and to arouse popular sympathy by appealing for reforms of the government and economy. By end of the trial, the court had received 110,000 clemency petitions, either signed or written entirely in blood, from sympathizers around the country pleading for a lenient sentence. Additionally, nine youths in Niigata asked to be tried by the court instead of the accused, and sent the court a jar containing nine of their own pickled severed pinky fingers as a gesture of their sincerity.Spector, Eagle Against the Sun. pp.36 The punishment handed down by the court was extremely light, and there was little doubt in the Japanese press that the murderers of Prime Minister Inukai would be released in a couple of years, if not sooner. Failure to severely punish the plotters in the May 15 Incident further eroded the rule of law and the power of the democratic government in Japan to confront the military. Indirectly, it led to the February 26 Incident and the increasing rise of Japanese militarism.Beasley, The Rise of Modern Japan References Bibliography    External links * National Diet Library Reference Category:Conflicts in 1932 Category:1932 in Japan Category:Politics of the Empire of Japan Category:Attempted coups in Japan Category:Rebellions in Japan Category:Assassinations in Japan Category:Sh≈çwa Restoration Category:May 1932 events Category:1930s coups d'√©tat and coup attempts Category:Terrorist incidents in the 1930s Category:1930s murders in Japan Category:1932 crimes in Japan Category:1932 murders in Asia ","title":"May 15 Incident"},{"id":"559286","text":"North part of Kowloon Tong. Lion Rock is visible in the background. Kowloon Tong () is an area of Hong Kong located in Kowloon West. The majority of the area is in the Kowloon City District. It is located south of Beacon Hill and north of Boundary Street. It is one of the most expensive residential districts in Hong Kong. It is popular among Hong Kong's wealthy residents because of its schools and low-density private housing. In addition, this area is noted for its love hotels and nursing homes. Within Kowloon West, it is administratively divided between Kowloon City District and Sham Shui Po District. History Kowloon Tong was originally a small village located in present-day Police Sport Association near Boundary Street, south of Woh Chai Hill. The area allowed cultivation based on rivers running down from Beacon Hill. In the 1920s, the Hong Kong Government developed the area of east of Kowloon Tong and Kowloon Tsai on both sides of Kowloon‚ÄìCanton Railway into a low density residential area (based British architecture). The residential area is thus known as Kowloon Tong. The area's roads and streets are largely named after counties in England. It was the home of a large number of wealthy English businessmen. The name of Kowloon Tsai is preserved in the hill west of the former village of Kowloon Tsai. Kowloon Tong is notoriously remembered as the site of martial artist Bruce Lee's death on Friday, July 20, 1973. Landmarks Festival Walk in Kowloon Tong.

She is best known for the book When Rabbit Howls (1987), an autobiography about her experiences after being diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder. Life According to her personal account, Truddi Chase was born on a homestead near Honeoye Falls, New York, and grew up in an apartment in the same town. In her autobiography and in numerous interviews, Chase said that she was repeatedly and violently sexually and physically abused by her stepfather and beaten and neglected by her mother during her childhood and teenage years.Chase, Truddi, When Rabbit Howls: by the Troops for Truddi Chase. Dutton, 1987. By her report, she had always remembered that molestation and abuse occurred from the age of two onwards but that she could not focus on details before going into therapy. According to her autobiography, Truddi Chase was not actually her birth-given name. At age 16, she ran away from her abusive household and changed her name to Truddi Chase to avoid being tracked down by her parents. In an interview with The Chicago Tribune, Truddi Chase described how her other personalities remained ‚Äúdormant‚Äù until stressors in her midlife caused extreme anxiety, eventually unravelling all of her characters. In 1979, Truddi Chase had her first experience with her perceived other identities. She described interactions between her many personality characters as well as interactions between her identities and physical body. It was during sessions with hypnotherapist, Dr. Robert Phillips, that she concluded that she had 92 identities. Chase chose not to integrate her identities, instead thinking of them as a cooperating team. In her book, she describes giving talks to convicted child molesters to explain her abuse history and to warn them that child abuse, particularly incest, is psychologically devastating. In a television interview with Oprah Winfrey, Chase stated that a Washington Post reporter had tracked down her family, including her stepfather, who denied abusing Chase. However, other members of Chase's family confirmed her story.\\"The Woman With 92 Personalities\\". oprah.com. Retrieved August 10, 2019.  When Rabbit Howls   Overview  When Rabbit Howls 1987 is Truddi Chase‚Äôs autobiography written from the perspective of her many identities. It begins with an introduction from her therapist, psychologist Dr. Robert Phillips, and then presents Truddi Chase‚Äôs experience with her 92 personalities. The book was published by Berkley and sold by Penguin Group both online and in stores across the world.  Reception  When Rabbit Howls became a New York Times bestseller in 1990. Her increased publicity as an author eventually led Chase to make an appearance on Oprah Winfrey‚Äôs television show, where she discussed her condition and life journey. As of 2020, When Rabbit Howls has a 4.6 out of 5 star rating on Amazon and a 4.4 out of 5 star review on Goodreads.  Criticism  Because all of the information known about Truddi Chase‚Äôs Dissociative Identity Disorder stems from her own account, as told to her therapist and to media outlets, some reviewers are skeptical about the veracity of her condition. Some skeptics question the authenticity of Chase‚Äôs condition itself, describing it as a potential ‚Äútherapist induced memory recall.‚Äù A ‚Äútherapist induced memory recall‚Äù would entail that Dr. Robert Phillips‚Äôs therapy sessions were responsible for Truddi Chase‚Äôs perception of multiple personalities. However, in his analysis of Truddi Chase‚Äôs condition, Dr. Robert Phillips is adamant that her condition originated from sequestered trauma due to childhood abuse.  Voices Within: The Lives of Truddi Chase  In 1990, Chase‚Äôs autobiography was made into a two-part ABC miniseries, retitled Voices Within: The Lives of Truddi Chase which cast Shelley Long in the title role. Chase worked closely with the screenwriter to ensure the adaptation was genuine. Death Truddi Chase died on March 10, 2010, at her home in Laurel, Maryland,\\"Truddi M. Chase: Guest Book\\".

Tower Comics set themselves apart by publishing 25-cent, 64-page comics, during a time of 12-cent, 32-page comics. The comics were something of a throw-back to the Golden Age, in that they had more pages than most of their contemporaries and usually featured five or six independent stories, with all the main characters coming together for the final story of the issue, a common Golden Age plotting device used in team books such as DC Comics's Justice Society of America.

Legacy  At some point in the early 1980s John Carbonaro purchased the rights to the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents and associated characters and published them in his JC Comics line.Sodaro, Robert J. \\"The Resplendent Sound of T.H.U.N.D.E.R.!\\" Comics Value Annual (1999). Archived on ThunderAgents.com. Accessed Feb. 8, 2014. In 1984, Deluxe Comics launched their own line of new T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents stories, claiming the characters had fallen into the public domain. Carbonaro sued,\\"Blood and T.H.U.N.D.E.R.\\" The Comics Journal #97 (April 1985), pp. 7‚Äì11. and was eventually awarded full legal rights to the property.\\"Deluxe suspends T.H.U.N.D.E.R.

It is found, in differing forms, both in non-human animals and in humans. In non-human animals  Konrad Lorenz, working with greylag geese and other animals such as water shrews, showed that ritualization was an important process in their development.Lorenz, Konrad,On Aggression 1963 He showed that the geese obsessively displayed a reflexive motor pattern of egg retrieval when stimulated by the sight of an egg outside their nest. Similarly, in the shrews, Lorenz showed that once they had become used to jumping over a stone in their path, they went on jumping at that place after the stone was taken away. This sort of behaviour is analogous to obsessive-compulsive disorder in humans. Oskar Heinroth in 1910 and Lorenz from 1935 onwards studied the triumph ceremony in geese; Lorenz described it as becoming a fixed ritual. It involves a rolling behaviour (of the head and neck) and cackling with the head stretched forward, and occurs only among geese that know each other, meaning within a family or between mates. The triumph ceremony appears in varied situations, such as when mates meet after having been separated, when disturbed, or after an attack. The behaviour is now known also in other species, such as Canada goose. In humans Ritualization is associated with the work of Catherine Bell.Bell, Catherine. Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice.. Oxford University Press, 1992 Bell, drawing on the Practice Theory of Pierre Bourdieu, has taken a less functional view of ritual with her elaboration of ritualization. More recently scholars interested in the cognitive science of religion such as Pascal Boyer, Pierre Li√©nard, and William W. McCorkle, Jr. have been involved in experimental, ethnographic, and archival research on how ritualized actions might inform the study of ritualization and ritual forms of action. Boyer, Li√©nard, and McCorkle argue that ritualized compulsions are in relation to an evolved cognitive architecture where social, cultural, and environmental selection pressures stimulate \\"hazard-precaution\\" systems such as predation, contagion, and disgust in human minds.Boyer, Pascal. The Naturalness of Religious Ideas. University of California Press, 1994Boyer, Pascal. Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought.

McCorkle argued that these ritualized compulsions (especially in regard to dead bodies vis-√†-vis, mortuary behavior) were turned into ritual scripts by professional guilds only several thousand years ago with advancement in technology such as the domestication of plants and animals, literacy, and writing.McCorkle Jr., William W. \\"Ritualizing the Disposal of the Deceased: From Corpse to Concept.\\" Peter Lang, 2010.

Jack and Jason Schneider, Have Not Been the Same: The Can-Rock Renaissance 1985-1995. ECW Press. . They were one of the most influential bands on the Canadian alternative music scene in the early 1990s, garnering widespread critical acclaim and radio play. Their most successful album, Shakespeare My Butt, was later named one of the ten greatest albums in Canadian music history in three successive reader polls by the music magazine Chart,\\"Top 100 Canadian Albums of All Time\\". Chart, October 12, 1999. as well as being ranked as the 84th greatest Canadian album of all time in Bob Mersereau's book The Top 100 Canadian Albums.\\"Dark horses keep album list from being predictable; Bob Mersereau's new book salutes the work of Young, Mitchell and ... Simply Saucer?\\" Edmonton Journal, October 23, 2007. History The band was formed by Ron Hawkins, Stephen Stanley and David Alexander, all members of the band Popular Front, as a side project at a time when their other band was going through internal tensions that eventually led to its breakup.\\"Lowest of the Low comes up in the world\\". Toronto Star, December 20, 1991. While performing as a trio in folk clubs, they met John Arnott, who became the band's fourth member. The band's punk-inspired jangle pop quickly became a popular draw on the Queen Street West club circuit in Toronto. They submitted the songs \\"Gamble\\" and \\"Motel 30\\", produced by Bob Wiseman, to the $100,000 CFNY Discovery to Disc contest in 1991. In 1991, they released their debut album, Shakespeare My Butt, on Page Publications. The album featured songs they had already performed and toured for several years as Popular Front. Hawkins's songs were filled with lyrics about Marxism and the Spanish Civil War, but also contained many references to Toronto landmarks like the Don River, Bathurst Street, and his local pub, \\"The Only\\" on Danforth Avenue. The album became one of the best-selling independent releases in Canadian history, selling just short of gold status, and was later named one of the ten greatest albums in Canadian music history by the music magazine Chart. However, the band also resisted some of the compromises and demands of the music industry; most notably, they played an early industry A&R; show wearing T-shirts that read \\"Don't suck corporate cock\\" and \\"Corporate rock still sucks\\". In 1993, the band signed a distribution deal with A&M; Records,\\"Lowest of the Low opts for major label\\". Ottawa Citizen, March 24, 1994. and released Hallucigenia in 1994. They toured to support the album and had begun early preparations for their follow-up album, but creative and business tensions resulted in the band breaking up later the same year. Hawkins released a solo album, The Secret of My Excess, in 1996 before forming Ron Hawkins and the Rusty Nails. Reunions In 2000, The Lowest of the Low reunited for a five-show tour, playing to sold-out venues in Toronto\\"LIVE: The Lowest Of The Low November 10, 2000 Lee's Palace Toronto, ON\\". Chart Attack, Review By: Brian Pascual and Buffalo. In January 2002, the live album Nothing Short of a Bullet was released. The album also featured a second disc with three new studio songs, including a cover of the Bad Religion song \\"Kerosene\\". In 2002, bassist John Arnott left the band and was replaced by Dylan Parker. In 2004, the band signed with MapleMusic Recordings. The same year, the band released Sordid Fiction, their first new studio album since 1994. Following the tour for that record, the band went on extended hiatus again. In November 2007 the band announced that they were breaking up for good. They played two final shows, one on December 4, 2007 at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto and another on December 8, 2007 at Club Infinity in Williamsville, New York. This concert was released by fans of the band as a DVD, incorporating several camcorder recordings of the show and a soundboard audio patch. The fan released DVD was entitled Into the Black, and can be downloaded on Ron Hawkins' web site. In December 2010, the band reunited again for a Massey Hall sold out show plus two nights at Lee's Palace in Toronto to celebrate the release of a new remastered edition of Shakespeare My Butt on Pheromone Recordings. They also announced plans for a tour in 2011 to mark the 20th anniversary of the album. On December 6, 2011, the band performed a surprise set at the 30th anniversary party for The Only, the pub that inspired the song \\"Just About 'The Only' Blues\\" on their first album. The Lowest of the Low made plans to record their fourth album in the fall of 2013, although the departure of founding member Stephen Stanley halted these plans. In November 2015, they released two new songs, \\"The Kids Are All Wrong\\" and \\"In the Blink of an Eye\\", with new guitarist Brian Macmillan replacing Stanley. In 2017, they released Do the Right Now, their first album of new material since 2004's Sordid Fiction.\\"After more than a decade, Lowest of the Low returns with a new album\\". Global News, September 5, 2017. In 2018, the band released a career- spanning vinyl LP box set called Shakespeare...My Box.

Influence The Lowest of the Low have been cited as a major influence by The Weakerthans, whose leader John K. Samson was previously a member of Propagandhi when the latter covered TLotL's song \\"Gamble\\". The Lowest of the Low have actually repaid the favour to The Weakerthans by singing about attending one of their concerts in the song \\"A Casual Overdose\\".

The original six characters were Black Condor, Doll Man, the Human Bomb, Ray, Phantom Lady, and Uncle Sam. Although the characters were created by Quality Comics, they never were gathered in a group before being acquired by DC. The team first appeared in a Justice League of America/Justice Society of America team-up, which ran in Justice League of America #107‚Äì108 (October‚ÄìDecember 1973), written by Len Wein and drawn by Dick Dillin. Their own ongoing series premiered with Freedom Fighters #1 (April 1976), written by Gerry Conway and Martin Pasko, and drawn by Ric Estrada. Fictional team history Cover to Freedom Fighters #1 (April 1976). Art by Ernie Chan. Although when the Freedom Fighters appeared for the first time in Justice League of America #107‚Äì108, they were considered natives from Earth-X, retroactive stories established the group as native from Earth-Two, who migrated to Earth-X. The earliest version of the Freedom Fighters was assembled on December 7, 1941. Uncle Sam brought them together, assembling Neon the Unknown, Magno, the Red Torpedo, the Invisible Hood, Miss America and Hourman to prevent a tragedy. However, this group failed in its attempt to stop the devastation at Pearl Harbor. All of them but Uncle Sam and Hourman were originally thought killed, but only Magno actually died. This version of the group was a retcon and their battle and alleged deaths were depicted in the pages of Roy Thomas' two books chronicling that era: All-Star Squadron and the Young All-Stars. The DC version of the characters were said to reside on the parallel world of \\"Earth-X\\", where Nazi Germany eventually won a prolonged World War II due to a Japanese invasion of California and the development of nuclear weapons by the Nazis. The Freedom Fighters had their own book for fifteen issues from 1976 to 1978,Freedom Fighters (1976), ComicVine. in which they crossed over to Earth-1 and were quickly set up by Silver Ghost. They spend the rest of the series on the run from the law, unable to clear themselves. The series was canceled before the storyline concluded; it was intended to be completed in Secret Society of Super Villains, but that too was canceled before the story could be published. This series also introduced the Crusaders and reintroduced Firebrand. In addition to the core members of the \\"second team\\" which were the members seen in the seventies comic book, other Quality heroes joined later: Red Bee, Miss America, Manhunter, Plastic Man, and Quicksilver. Since the Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Freedom Fighters have been based on the main DC Universe Earth, and were all members of the All-Star Squadron. Years after the war, a third version of the team surfaced in the 1980s, with the rise of a new age of heroes. The Freedom Fighters, along with the Blackhawks and Justice Society, were captured by alien Appellaxians and placed in internment camps. They were freed by the new Justice League of America. The Freedom Fighters regrouped for a brief time, but soon called it quits again when Firebrand was killed in battle with the Silver Ghost. A fourth version of the team appeared as an auxiliary of the new Justice Society of America. The Human Bomb, Black Condor, and Phantom Lady were later killed by the Secret Society of Super Villains in Infinite Crisis #1. Damage was critically injured, Iron Munro was absent, and the Ray was captured by the Psycho-Pirate as part of Alexander Luthor's plans. Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters A new team of heroes debuted in the limited series Crisis Aftermath: The Battle for Bl√ºdhaven, and later featured as Freedom Fighters members in the miniseries Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters, which premiered in July 2006. This team consists of new incarnations of the Phantom Lady, the Ray (Stan Silver), the Human Bomb, Doll Man, Bigfoot, Destroyer and Face. It is part of S.H.A.D.E., a secret American government agency chartered under the USA PATRIOT Act, led by Father Time. The new team conducts assassinations and other illegal acts against criminal and terrorist organizations. As issue #1 of Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters begins, the team is tasked to capture the revived Uncle Sam, who is in the process of forming his own Freedom Fighters team; Sam subsequently recruits the S.H.A.D.E. members to his cause, openly disapproving of their use of deadly force (although they continue to kill people even under Uncle Sam's guidance).According to Justin Gray's July 2006 interview with The Kingdom, his team's members will ultimately include: Uncle Sam, Doll Man, Phantom Lady, the Ray, Firebrand, Human Bomb, the Black Condor, and Miss America. This version of the team is loosely based on notes by Grant Morrison and written by Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray. Uncle Sam is portrayed as an almost Christ-like figure, returning from the dead, with the new Firebrand filling a John the Baptist role. Father Time is shown as aiding in Senator Frank Knight's being secretly murdered in the midst of his successful campaign for the Presidency of the U.S. and replaced by a sentient robot double, Gonzo the Mechanical Bastard, who proceeds with an agenda to implant RFID chips in every U.S. citizen by law and control them to bring chaos to the world through war. Panel from Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters #8. Art by Daniel Acu√±a. In Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters #3, a team created by Father Time called First Strike attacked the Freedom Fighters but not before being stopped by the new Black Condor. In #4, Condor manages to weaken First Strike long enough for the Freedom Fighters to fight back. Human Bomb kills one of First Strike's members, Propaganda, and the team heads back to S.H.A.D.E. headquarters. In #5, The Freedom Fighters defeat First Strike, but are taken out by a young woman claiming to be Miss America. While they are being tortured, S.H.A.D.E. headquarters is attacked by a new Red Bee and an old woman claiming to be the real Miss America. In #6, the Freedom Fighters defeat the new Miss America with the original's help, forcing Father Time to retreat. As he begins \\"molting\\" into a new body, he gives the order to \\"activate the traitor.\\" This turns out to be the Ray, who attacks and kills the new Invisible Hood and calls down giant reinforcements. In #7, The Freedom Fighters face off against the Cosmigods as Uncle Sam calls them. In the midst of the battle the traitorous Ray is confronted by the returning Ray Terrill. As predicted Gonzo turns on the newly rejuvenated Father Time, who proceeds to give Uncle Sam the evidence to prove Gonzo's true identity. Sam presents the evidence to the world, and seemingly the final battle between First Strike and the Freedom Fighters begins. In #8, The Freedom Fighters engage in battle against Gonzo's metahuman taskforce at the Washington Monument, and quickly gain support from the civilians. The public eye are now seeing them as real heroes, which was later revealed to be part of Father Time's plan all along. He tricked Gonzo into believing that S.H.A.D.E was against Uncle Sam, while in truth he was preparing the Freedom Fighters to help combat a major threat in the future. Father Time captures Gonzo and turns him into an 'Orphan Box' in the shape of a pair of spectacles. He plans to use it against Gonzo's creator, the Shadow Demons. All of the metahuman taskforce members disappear into the timestream along with Father Time shortly thereafter. A week later, the new President appoints the Freedom Fighters the new directors of S.H.A.D.E. Further adventures In Countdown #38, the Freedom Fighters are seen trying to stop an unplanned nuclear missile launch, initiated by the Calculator. In the new Freedom Fighters mini-series written by Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti in 2007, Red Bee is captured by an alien insect swarm and transformed into a human/insect hybrid. At the same time, S.H.A.D.E. has planned to make the Freedom Fighters into media darlings to help increase faith in the government following the Amazonian incident. Uncle Sam, Firebrand, Doll Man, and Human Bomb refuse to go along with the plan and return to the Heartland. For a time, the remaining Freedom Fighters become celebrities, part of a new group called the Crusaders. Red Bee later collapses in her apartment and a swarm of insects suddenly rise out of her body. Phantom Lady, unable to cope with the media attention, goes on a binge spree, culminating in her drunkenly slicing a criminal in half on national television. Stormy is brought to the heartland, where her body is cleaned of toxins by Miss America. Sam and Doll Man recruit the original Doll Man (Darrell Dane) from a micro-environment within the Pentagon. After the head of the Crusaders program, Robbins, tries to kill Red Bee, the Freedom Fighters confront him. It is revealed that Robbins has mental powers that he used to control the Crusaders ‚Äî and Stormy ‚Äî leading to her binge. While the Crusaders and Freedom Fighters battle, Red Bee is overtaken by her insectoid side, and uses her pheromones to enslave the Crusaders and Freedom Fighters, and prepares to create a \\"hive\\" on Earth. Meanwhile, an attempt to cure the Doll Men and several other micro-sized individuals goes horribly wrong, as all of them are merged into a single mutant form. The mutant goes on a rampage until Emma Thompson reaches Lester. Red Bee is cured of her affliction by Langford Terrill, who had gained the powers of Neon the Unknown. The team then prepares to fight off an invasion by the insectoids. After their victory, the group go their separate ways, but Sam declares that they will be needed when the Crisis begins. Blackest Night In the Blackest Night crossover event, Black Lantern power rings are shown heading toward the graves of Phantom Lady, Black Condor, and Human Bomb, presumably to revive them for use in the interstellar revenant army being assembled. Indeed, at least those three are seen later attacking JSA headquarters along with the undead revenants of the Society's members. These three Black Lanterns, along with Al Pratt's undead form, focus on attacking Damage, though they have little success, continually getting blown up, regenerating and rising again to attack him, until Jean Loring's revenant kills him. Ongoing series A new ongoing Freedom Fighters series began in September 2010. However, it was canceled after only 9 issues.Review of the final issue. New 52 In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the Freedom Fighters still inhabit Earth-10, but according to Grant Morrison's Multiversity revision of the concept, Kal-L landed in German territory in 1938. Hitler reverse-engineered the alien technology that the Kryptonian starship incorporated and released Kal-L/Overman on American forces in the 1950s which enabled Nazi Germany to win the Second World War. However, Overman became aware of the evil of his comrades after seeing the massive numbers of deaths of innocent people who didn't fit into the Nazi ideology. After Hitler died, Overman and his government were able to establish a utopia. The Freedom Fighters still exist as a team of genetically enhanced metahumans thanks to the genius of the Earth-10 Dr. Sivana, but in revised and inclusive composition (Ray is gay, Doll Man is a Jehovah's Witness, Black Condor is an African-American, and Phantom Lady is Romani). The Freedom Fighters commit various acts of terrorism against Overman's post-Nazi regime while Overman is in conflict with himself as he still feels guilt over the ethnic and ideological purges of the Hitler-era. In the Freedom Fighters most extreme attack, they drop the Earth-10's Justice League orbital base on Metropolis, killing millions of people and even further grieving Overman. DC Rebirth New Super-Man features a group called The Freedom Fighters of China. Each member of the group is a Chinese version of one of the original Freedom Fighters. They are led by Flying Dragon General (an analog of Uncle Sam); other members include Sunbeam (analog of The Ray), Blue Condor (analog of Black Condor), Ghost Woman (Phantom Lady), Folding Paper Man (Doll Man), and Human Firecracker (Human Bomb). Other versions * In the final issue of 52, a new Multiverse is revealed, consisting of 52 realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated \\"Earth-10\\", X being the Roman Numeral for 10. This new alternate Earth differs from the original pre-Crisis Earth-X. In original continuity, the Freedom Fighters were the only metahumans on the original Earth-X. However, the new Earth-10 is premised on the continued ascendancy of Nazi Germany, which was defeated in the original JLA/JSA/Freedom Fighters crossover. Earth-10 is home to the JLAxis, which consists of Nazi counterparts of the Justice League, who combat an alternate version of the Freedom Fighters. Prefigured by comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-X, which renders these new characters unrelated to previous versions. * In the WildStorm miniseries The Authority: Revolution, the initial protagonists are a group called the \\"Sons of Liberty\\", a superpatriot group of the 1940s and 1950s. They consist of Paul Revere (super-strength and \\"broadcast empath\\"), Minute-Maid (super-strength), Johnny Rocketman (supersonic flight), the Human Hand-Grenade (with the power to shrink, explode, and re-constitute his own body), and Fallout (a man with undefined nuclear powers who wears a shroud). The group is a pastiche of the Freedom Fighters. * In the DC Comics universe, the \\"Sons of Liberty\\" were a paramilitary group that funded Agent Liberty. * In Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer: Superwoman/Batwoman #1, written by Freedom Fighters writers Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti, Earth-11 was revealed to be an Earth home to gender-reversed versions of the heroes of New Earth. Among them were the Freedom Fighters, consisting of female versions of the Ray, Human Bomb, Black Condor, and, strangely, Etrigan, as well as a male version of Phantom Lady named Phantom Man. They are led by Columbia, a female version of Uncle Sam. * In an alternate timeline featured in The All-New Booster Gold #8, a group calling themselves the Freedom Fighters exists. It consists of Hawkman, Green Arrow, Anthro, Wild Dog, and Pantha. * In \\"Time of Crisis\\", the Crisis on Infinite Earths homage module for Mutants and Masterminds, the √úbermenschen team is composed of analogues to the original Freedom Fighters. In other media Television * The original Freedom Fighters appear in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Cry Freedom Fighters!\\". The line-up consists of Uncle Sam as the leader, Doll Man, Human Bomb, the Ray, Phantom Lady, and the Black Condor. They travel to the planet Qward to help Batman and Plastic Man defeat its oppressive government led by the Supreme Chairman of Qward before he can lead his army to invade Earth. * A contemporary version of the Freedom Fighters appears in the 2017 Arrowverse crossover event \\"Crisis on Earth-X.\\" The members that appear are Raymond Terrill / The Ray (who was displaced from Earth-1), Leonard \\"Leo\\" Snart / Citizen Cold, Jimmy Olson / Guardian, General Winn Schott, and Red Tornado. This group was formed on Earth-X where World War II was not won by the Allied Forces, and by 2017, the resistance movement under Schott's leadership struggles against the forces of Dark Arrow (Oliver Queen) and Overgirl (Kara Zor-El of Krypton-X). The Freedom Fighters eventually developed a temporal gateway, a device that enables interdimensional travels, in which later seized by Dark Arrow for his schemes to invade parallel Earths. However, it is revealed later that it is what the Freedom Fighters intended because of their awareness of Dark Arrow had been researching means to travel interdimensionally, and thus baited the archer for a plot to strand him and Overgirl on a parallel Earth after the Fighters destroy the gateway to separate them from their army. However, with Terrill and Snart's aids, the Fighters' plan is foiled by Earth-1 and Earth-38's heroes, who are stranded in their universe and need the gateway to return to Earth-1. Despite this, Dark Arrow and Overgirl are later killed during their fights with their respective parallel universe counterparts, Green Arrow (Oliver Queen of Earth-1) and Supergirl (Kara Zor-El of Krypton-38), on Earth-1. In the aftermath, Terrill and Snart establish an alliance with Earth-1 and Earth-38 heroes for future battles against the New Reich and other threats. In \\"Fury Rogue\\", an episode of The Flash, reveals that the Freedom Fighters begin rebuilding their world after winning the war against the New Reich and is fighting to suppress the regime's remnants. In the comic book tie-in of the crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", reveals that The Reich's remnants have retreated to Germany and the Allies are again fighting the Axis Powers, and thus in the middle of World War III. * In the Stargirl episode Hourman and Doctor Mid-Nite, it was revealed that Red Bee was a member of both the All-Star Squadron and the Freedom Fighters. He was later killed by Baron Blitzkrieg when his secret identity was revealed. Miscellaneous * The original Freedom Fighters appeared in Justice League Unlimited #17. A rogue US Government agency led by General Mendenhall and Capt. Finn sends them against the Justice League. The roll call was Uncle Sam, Doll Man, Human Bomb, Phantom Lady, the Ray, and Black Condor.Justice League Unlimited #17 A line of dialogue in the story clarifies that the Ray included as a member of the Freedom Fighters is the father of the Ray who appeared in several episodes of the Justice League Unlimited animated series.

It is primarily used for censorship. The effect is a standard graphics filter, available in all but the most basic bitmap graphics editors. As censorship A familiar example of pixelization can be found in television news and documentary productions, in which vehicle license plates and faces of suspects at crime scenes are routinely obscured to maintain the presumption of innocence, such as how it appears in the television series COPS. Bystanders and others who do not sign release forms are also customarily pixelized. Footage of nudity (including male and female genitals, buttocks, nipples, pubic hair, or areolae) is likewise obscured in some media: before the watershed in many countries, in newspapers or general magazines, or in places in which the public cannot avoid seeing the image (such as on billboards). Drug references, as well as gestures considered obscene (such as the finger) may also be censored in this manner. Pixelization is not usually used for this purpose in films, DVDs, subscription television services, or pornography (except for countries in which the law requires it). When obscene language is censored by an audible bleep, the mouth of the speaker may be pixelized to prevent lip reading, such as in COPS. Graphic injuries and excess blood may also be pixelized. Pixelization may also be used to avoid unintentional product placement, or to hide elements that would date a broadcast, such as date and time stamps on home video submissions. Censorship for such purposes is most common on reality television series. Image:Pixelization mosaic.jpgPixelization was used to anonymize this photograph.

In this updated print, the image of the large ocean wave shifts from the traditional style of the Japanese woodcut print to a pixelized image and finally to a wireframe model computer graphics image.vorpal.us: \\"Wave of the Future is now the Past\\". Retrieved July 13, 2009vorpal.us: \\"High resolution image of 'Wave of the Future'\\". Retrieved July 14, 2009 Westworld (1973) was the first feature film to use digital image processing to pixelize photography to simulate an android's point of view. Alternative techniques The mosaic tiles of this human figure in the Saint Stephen Church in Umm Er-Rasas in Jordan have been rearranged by aniconists. A black rectangular or square box (known as censor bars) may be simply be used to occlude parts of images completely (for example, a black bar covering the eyes instead of the entire face being pixelized). Censor bars were extensively used as a graphic device in the January 2012 protests against SOPA and PIPA. A drawback of pixelization is that any differences between the large pixels can be exploited in moving images to reconstruct the original, unpixelized image; squinting at a pixelized, moving image can sometimes achieve a similar result. In both cases, integration of the large pixels over time allows smaller, more accurate pixels to be constructed in a still image result. Completely obscuring the censored area with pixels of a constant color or pixels of random colors escapes this drawback but can be more aesthetically jarring. An additional drawback, when pixelization is used to reduce the repulsing, disturbing or, more generally shocking, aspect of an image, is that all information contained in the pixelized area are lost for the audience. Other visual processing techniques, on the other hand can help reduce the shocking aspect of images or videos while preserving most of the information of the media. International legal standards Nudity is obscured on television networks in the United States. FCC states It is a violation of federal law to air obscene, indecent, and profane programming at any time especially during certain hours. Monetary penalties and revocation of licenses are issued for law breakers. Japanese pornography laws require that genitals in films (including animated works) and other forms of adult media (such as eroge, drawings, etc) be obscured. Article 175 of Penal Code (Act No.45 of 1907) still in effect today in Japan forbids any person and imprisons anyone who distributes, sells or displays in public an obscene document, drawing or other objects of such nature. In Thailand, restrictions are placed on television broadcast depiction of cigarettes being smoked,2Bangkok.com: \\"Smoking on Thai TV\\" Retrieved February 15, 2007 alcohol being consumed, or guns being pointed at people. Pixelization is one method of censoring this content; otherwise, censor bars are used. In the Philippines, pixelization is also used if there are scenes of naked people or cadavers, bloody depiction of death by any means (e.g. gunshot wounds) and exposure of innards (sometimes rendered in black and white and blurred), and the finger gesture, among objectionable content. However, nudity and some bloody scenes are cut entirely and pointing of guns or blades to oneself or others are cropped. Philippine law states production, printing, publication, importation, sale, distribution, and exhibition of obscene and pornographic material is strictly prohibited and is punishable by law.

The character was created by Gardner Fox and Murphy Anderson, and first appeared in Hawkman #4 (November 1964). Zatanna is both a stage magician and an actual magician, like her father Giovanni \\"John\\" Zatara. As such she has many of her father's powers relating to magic, typically controlled by speaking the words of her incantations spelled backwards. She is known for her involvement with the Justice League, her retconned childhood association with Batman, and her crossing of the Vertigo line with characters such as romantic partner John Constantine. Due to her long history in DC Comics, she has been named as one of DC's best and most powerful female characters, one of the Justice League's greatest and most important characters, and as a member of some of the Justice League's best line-ups. Zatanna made her first live-action appearance as a recurring character in the final three seasons of Smallville, portrayed by actress Serinda Swan. Publication history Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Murphy Anderson, Zatanna first appeared in Hawkman #4 (November 1964). When she is introduced, she is on a quest to find her father Zatara who made his first appearance in Action Comics #1 but had not been published regularly for several years. The storyline crossed multiple comics published by DC at the time, culminating in issues of Justice League of America, also written by Fox. Fictional character biography Pre-Crisis Zatanna is the daughter of magician Giovanni \\"John\\" Zatara who appeared in Golden Age comic books and Sindella, a member of the mystical species Homo magi. Her younger cousin, the teenager Zachary Zatara, is also a magician in the DCU. Zatanna makes her living as a stage illusionist prior to discovering her magical abilities while investigating the disappearance of her father. Her original costume is based upon her father's costume but substituting fishnet stockings and high heels for slacks. Zatanna's search for her father was the subject of a storyline which was featured in several titles edited by Julius Schwartz, and in it, Zatanna interacts with Hawkman and Hawkgirl; battles Batman and Robin while in disguise as a witch and under the control of the villain the Outsider; and teams with the Atom, Green Lantern, and the Elongated Man. The series culminated in Justice League of America #51 (February 1967). This Justice League adventure took place during the Batman television craze when Batman was at the height of his popularity. The premise that the witch in Detective Comics #336 was Zatanna was perceived as an attempt to get Batman participating in this issue of Justice League of America no matter how vague the connection to Zatanna's quest was. She briefly was featured in backup features in Adventure Comics and Supergirl from 1971 to 1973.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 153: \\"For ten issues, [Supergirl] continued flying solo, albeit with the occasional help of guest stars like Zatanna and Prez.\\" Zatanna assists the Justice League of America on a few missions before being elected to membership in Justice League of America #161 (Dec. 1978). Soon after Zatanna joined the group, the identity of her mother was revealed in a multi-issue storyline. Zatanna teamed with Superman in DC Comics Presents and with Batman in The Brave and the Bold. A ten-page short story in DC Special Blue Ribbon Digest #5 (Nov.‚ÄìDec. 1980) revealed new details about Zatara's origin and how Zatanna's quest to locate her father began. During her tenure with the Justice League, her power level diminishes, so that she can only control the four elements of earth, air, fire, and water. She starred in a backup feature in World's Finest Comics #274‚Äì278 and the limitation of her powers is reversed in World's Finest Comics #277 (March 1982). She assists Wonder Woman and several other superheroines in fighting an extraterrestrial threat.Manning, Matthew K. \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 196: \\"In a three-part tale by plotter Paul Levitz, scripter Roy Thomas, and artist Gene Colan, Wonder Woman was helped by Zatanna, Supergirl, Madame Xanadu, Black Canary, Starfire, Wonder Girl, and the Earth-2 heroines Huntress and Power Girl.\\" Post-Crisis Zatanna starred in a special solo one-shot in 1987 that featured Zatanna exploring her mother Sindella's background and battling the villainous sorceress Allura. In Neil Gaiman's The Books of Magic limited series, Zatanna becomes friends and even temporary guardian to Timothy Hunter, a boy destined to become the greatest wizard in the world, and his girlfriend Molly who at the time was cursed by the Queen of the Fairies and unable to touch anything in the human world, including the ground. After a brief stay, she sent Molly home and Tim wandered off on his own adventures. In 1993, Zatanna starred in her first solo limited series, titled Zatanna: Come Together, which saw her summoning her mother's spirit and battling the sorcerer Tannarak and a demon called Xaos. When the Justice League vanish in the past as they attempt to rescue the missing Aquaman, an emergency protocol set up by Batman assembles a new League, with this team including Jason Blood as its magical expert. However, when the current threat is identified as Gamemnae, an ancient Atlantean sorceress who seeks to conquer the world, she uses a quagmire spell to absorb Zatanna and Tempest into herself. When new League leader Nightwing attempts to order Blood to transform into Etrigan to help them against Gamemnae, Blood insists that Zatanna is the one they need, sacrificing himself to Gamemnae's quagmire spell in order to free Zatanna. She subsequently joins Nightwing, Firestorm and Hawkgirl in travelling back to ancient Atlantis, where Aquaman has been trapped in a pool of water as a water wraith, Firestorm creating a channel between the pool and the sea before Zatanna casts a spell that allowed the water-based Aquaman to control the entire ocean as his body, allowing him to sink Atlantis in the past and present and disrupt Gamemnae's power. Zatanna starred in another solo one-shot in 2003, Zatanna: Everyday Magic, in which she fought Nimue Ravensong, a magic-user jealous of Zatanna's ability to use magic naturally and without committing sacrifices. Nimue seduced and cursed John Constantine, leading Zatanna into conflict with the wannabe sorceress. In the 2004 limited series Identity Crisis, Zatanna is a member of the Justice League at the time the villain Doctor Light rapes the Elongated Man's wife, Sue Dibny. When apprehended, he threatens the JLA members' families. Although Zatanna is prepared to erase Light's memories of the incident as she had done to other villains with knowledge dangerous to the League, tampering with Light's mind sparks a debate among the team's members: should the villain's personality be transformed to prevent him from repeating his crime? Zatanna, Hawkman, and the Atom (Ray Palmer) vote for such action, while Green Arrow, Black Canary, and Green Lantern vote against. The Flash (Barry Allen) breaks the tie. Zatanna mind-wipes Light, and the process results in his intellectual abilities being lowered.Cowsill, Alan \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 313: \\"The Justice League had...asked Zatanna to erase Light's memory and alter his mind.\\" In the midst of the process, Batman appears and tries to stop it. Zatanna freezes him, and the members vote unanimously to erase Batman's memories of the incident as well. Her working relationship to Batman sours after he discovers the alteration to his memory. When Zatanna helps Batman with reconnaissance at one of Ra's al Ghul's Lazarus Pits, she asks him why he came to her. \\"I needed someone I could trust,\\" Batman says. \\"But I had to settle for you.\\" After Infinite Crisis, their relationship appears to have warmed; in Detective Comics #824 he calls her for information on a card-counter involved in scamming the Penguin. He makes no mention of their conflict, and casually calls her by her nickname, \\"Zee\\". Catwoman discovers that Zatanna's mind-wipe of Dr. Light in Identity Crisis is not an isolated occurrence; Catwoman's journey from villain to hero and her resulting efforts to lead a moral life are retconned as being the result of Zatanna's mental intervention. Catwoman comes to distrust her memories, motives, and the choices she has made since that incident. In retaliation, Catwoman covers Zatanna's mouth with a piece of duct tape, gagging her, and shoves her out a window. A 2005 four-issue Zatanna limited series was published as part of Grant Morrison's Seven Soldiers event.Cowsill \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 319: \\"Grant Morrison's imagining of the Seven Soldiers of Victory was one of DC's most adventurous titles...The story started in Seven Soldiers of Victory #0 and continued in seven four-issue miniseries ‚Äì The Bulleteer, Frankenstein, Mister Miracle, Zatanna, Shining Knight, Manhattan Guardian, and Klarion.\\" In it, at a support group for superheroes, she recounts a failed magical ritual to search for her father's tomes, during which one of her past spells summons a shapeshifter named Gwydion, who kills her companions. This trauma, combined with her guilt from her former mind-wipes, robs her of her powers. With the help of her new apprentice, Misty Kilgore, she captures Gwydion to use as her own. She eventually regains her confidence and powers, and uses them to defeat Zor, a rogue Time Tailor who released the Sheeda as a plague to infect and degrade the entire universe. As a reward, the other Time Tailors allow her one last meeting with her father, who reveals that his books were written for her, his \\"greatest spell and gift to the world.\\" In the final battle against the Sheeda, Zatanna casts a spell to move time and space, retroactively positioning the Seven Soldiers to overthrow the Sheeda. In Detective Comics #833 (August 2007), it is stated that Zatanna's father was a friend of Thomas Wayne. Zatara trained Bruce Wayne in the art of escape, and Bruce and Zatanna were childhood friends, although Batman believes that he has never met her in Justice League of America #51, and her only memory of meeting him is while she was disguised. Bruce helps Zatanna investigate the death of one of her former assistants; all clues point to a performer named Ivar Loxias. Loxias is revealed to be the Joker in disguise; he shoots Zatanna in the throat and incapacitates Batman. Zatanna is able to heal herself by writing a curing spell in her own blood, and she is instrumental in foiling the Joker's scheme. Bruce puts Zatanna's betrayal behind him, allowing the two to renew their friendship. On the \\"Roll Call\\" of Justice League of America #22 (August 2008), Zatanna is listed as a part of the team. Called upon to help with the Red Tornado's restoration in his android form, she aids the League when they are attacked by a new, powerful iteration of Amazo. During the battle, Zatanna has her mouth magically removed with her spells, and once again uses her blood to write out spells and restore it. She is silenced again after Amazo uses his power ring to create a gag for her mouth that she is unable to remove, rendering her useless for much of the fight. After Wonder Woman throws off Amazo's concentration and causes the gag to vanish, Zatanna defeats Amazo once and for all by using the Red Tornado's soul. Following this battle, Zatanna rejoins the team. Zatanna later accompanies Firestorm, Black Lightning, and Batman to Metropolis after they come to believe Kimiyo Hoshi has been kidnapped by agents of the covert metahuman team known as the Shadow Cabinet. After a brief conflict, Zatanna and the others are informed by teenage superheroine Rocket that Kimiyo's perceived abduction was actually a misunderstanding caused by the Shadow Cabinet's mission to seek out her help in dealing with the cosmic vampire known as Starbreaker. With assistance from Hardware and Icon, Zatanna and her comrades are able to defeat Starbreaker in a battle in the Himalayas. New 52 costume. Art by Mikel Janin. In Gotham City Sirens Zatanna is visited and restrained by Poison Ivy, who interacts via a tree and asks her if her encounter with Catwoman changed Selina in any way. Zatanna takes a leave of absence from the JLA, only to reappear during a battle with Despero. Once he is defeated, Zatanna informs the League of the apocalyptic events of the Blackest Night taking place across the globe. After taking the team to the Hall of Justice to find Firestorm, she is forced to fight the undead form of her father, continually pitting the black magic he wields against her own; it is implied she was successful in banishing the Black Lantern, but was left psychologically crushed from having to kill her father again. In the aftermath of Blackest Night, Kimiyo mentions that Zatanna is one of the members who has left the team. In May 2010 Zatanna received her own solo series, written by Paul Dini and drawn by St√©phane Roux. No longer an active member of the JLA, Zatanna is asked by officer Dale Colton to help solve a murder case at a restaurant frequented by mobsters. Zatanna informs Dale that the murderer was a powerful sorcerer known as Brother Night, who rules the supernatural crime scene in San Francisco. After Zatanna shows up at Night's demonic nightclub and threatens him, he responds by calling upon a powerful nightmare demon for help in battling her, but Zatanna defeats and imprisons the demon to aid her later. A crooked casino owner who had made a deal for eternal youth with the demon of avarice by selling the souls of his brides to the demon attempts to use a love potion to win Zatanna's soul. When her cousin Zachary Zatara breaks the spell, the casino owner begs Zatanna to turn him into a soulless lump of gold in order to escape torment in Hell. Aside from Brother Night, Zatanna faces other threats, such as Oscar Hample, a man who tried to murder her when she was a child and was turned into a puppet by her father. Zatanna is kidnapped by a new villain named Siphon, who tries to steal her abilities. Siphon incapacitates Zatanna by binding and gagging her, preventing her from incanting spells. As Siphon taunts his captive of her predicament, she is able to relay her location to Power Girl. Power Girl soon discovers Siphon's plot and defeats Siphon, rescuing the bound and gagged Zatanna. The Zatanna series ended with issue #16 (October 2011). The New 52 In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Zatanna is one of the main characters in Peter Milligan's Justice League Dark series. She sports a new costume, though she still wears her classic magician's outfit during shows. In the first issue, she learns that Superman, Wonder Woman, and Cyborg have been defeated by the Enchantress and volunteers her services to the League. The Black Canary and Zatanna graphic novel Bloodspell written by Paul Dini and drawn by Joe Quinones was to be released in 2012, but was delayed until May 2014. The story centers around a 16-year-old Black Canary's first meeting with Zatanna. DC Rebirth Zatanna makes her first appearance in Detective Comics #958, assisting Bruce in taking out a robot chasing after a cult member. Later on, it is revealed Bruce would like to see her in hopes that she will teach him more about magic that would revive Tim Drake. After the conclusion of the main storyline of the DC Rebirth Batwoman series, Zatanna is implied to be an outpatient therapist of sorts for Beth Kane, Kate Kane's twin sister.Batwoman (vol. 3) #17 (September 2018). DC Comics. In 2018, a new Justice League Dark series began, with a redesigned Zatanna being part of the team.https://www.cbr.com/justice- league-dark-wonder-woman-swamp-thing/ Zatanna travels to Northern Italy to bind a group of demons called Il Osservatori in a 2018 story called Zatanna: Sleight of Hand, published in the DC New Talent Showcase 2018 #1. Relationships Zatanna has had various romantic relationships with fellow DC characters, including John Constantine (with whom she practiced tantra) and Doctor Thirteen. Zatanna had a flirtational relationship with her fellow Justice Leaguer Barry Allen / the Flash shortly after the death of his wife Iris. She has a strong friendship with Batman due to their shared (retconned) pasts. In Detective Comics #843-844, Zatanna and Bruce briefly discuss the possibility of having a more meaningful relationship. Both later concede that Bruce is too devoted to his cause as Batman to give her the relationship she wishes for, but the pair reaffirm their bond as close friends. The DC Animated Universe touches on Bruce and Zatanna's closeness depicted as her having had a crush on him while he trained under her father as \\"John Smith\\" , though she later found out his real name. Decades later, an elderly Bruce is shown to still care for her as he keeps a picture of her along with pictures of his other love interests in a file in the Batcomputer. Catwoman appears to consider Zatanna a more dangerous contender for Bruce's attentions than Jezebel Jet, his fianc√© at the time. A pep talk between the two women confirms how Zatanna really meant, during the fateful discussion with Bruce, to explore the possibility of a true romance, but turned out quietly resigned to the role of best friend and confidant. Claiming to act on Bruce's best interest, she pushes Selina into confessing her feelings to Bruce, thus stealing him from Jezebel Jet before it is too late. In the TV series Young Justice, Zatanna has a flirtatious and possibly romantic friendship with Dick Grayson / Robin during Season 1. Dick later says that they have a \\"history\\" in Season 2 (five years after Season 1), implying that they dated and eventually broke up but still remained close. In The New 52: Futures End timeline, Zatanna is romantically involved with Jason Blood / Etrigan the Demon. Powers and abilities Zatanna gagged and incapacitated. Art by Sami Basri. Zatanna is one of the most powerful sorceresses in the DC universe, whose abilities are apparently genetic. As a tribute to her father and as a focal point, she usually casts spells by speaking verbal commands backwards. She has proven capable on many occasions of casting spells by speaking normally, saying words that means nothing, and, in rarer occasions, the ability to use magic for simple tasks without speaking. Like the Black Canary, Zatanna's reliance on her voice often leads to her being bound and gagged by villains, a measure that renders her 'powerless'. On very rare occasions, Zatanna has cast spells by writing them in her own blood rather than speaking them aloud. It is used as a last resort, only to heal from severe physical damage preventing her from speaking, like having her larynx mangled by a bullet, or her mouth magically erased by her own powers. The only magic command issued in both cases, Heal me, had to be spelled backwards, as if she were speaking (laeH em). Her magical powers increase if not used, but overuse can deplete them to the point that further use strains her physical well-being; as with other magical users, the only way to restore her waning powers is an extended period of rest. While not as adept as Madame Xanadu, Zatanna has proven herself able to call upon tarot reading for insight or divination. Apparently, such a task does not require verbal incantations, spoken or written, at all, nor is it tied to a specific tarot deck. The limits of her powers have never been clearly established. She is often depicted working alongside the most powerful magic- users on Earth, including Circe, Madame Xanadu, John Constantine, the Enchantress, and Doctor Fate, while on another occasion Jason Blood sacrificed himself to free Zatanna from a trap, as he felt that she was better qualified to face the current threat than he was. She has used her powers to command elemental forces, heal, transmute and transmogrify objects, manipulate minds, and attack her opponents with energy blasts. She has resurrected the city of Metropolis from ruin, merged Aquaman's spirit with the entire ocean in the finale of the \\"Obsidian Age\\" story arc (albeit after the sorcerer Gamemnae had already merged Aquaman with a pool of water), and manipulated time and space. During a portion of her initial tenure with the Justice League, her powers were more limited, consisting in the manipulation of fire, air, water, and earth. Furthermore, her powers seems tied to her self-confidence, as the long series of blunders described in Seven Soldiers left her both emotionally and psychologically shattered, powerless, until she was able to restore her lost confidence. Zatanna is a skilled illusionist, showgirl and stage magician even without resorting to her innate magical powers. She considers part of her \\"training\\" exercising sleight of hand tricks, and she claims to have invented a variation of the three-card monte called the \\"Zatara shuffle\\", in which she is so fast and precise that, even without resorting to cheating, only skilled gamblers like Selina Kyle are able to follow the movements of her hands. Zatanna is also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by her father during her childhood. Other versions DC Super Dictionary The 1978 DC Super Dictionary invented a character, Conjura, who had the same magic ability as Zatanna, in addition to possessing a time-traveling amulet. While possessing similar powers, the character was visually distinct from Zatanna, depicting her as a dark-skinned woman in a purple jumpsuit, jackboots, and yellow turban with a long cape. Earth-3 * Annataz Arataz, Zatanna's evil Earth-3 counterpart, assists Superman-Prime to detain and torment Mr. Mxyzptlk in Countdown to Final Crisis #23. The imp refuses to provide Prime with information, and Annataz restores his powers. Reflecting upon her own prior cruel actions, she allows herself to be killed by the enraged villain. Her spells are recited \\"upside-down\\", rather than backwards. * Zatanna's evil Antimatter Earth counterpart, who unlike the Earth-3 counterpart is called Zatanna, is briefly mentioned in Trinity #35, as one of the few survivors of a purge on magic users. Amalgam Comics In the Amalgam Comics universe, Zatanna is merged with the Scarlet Witch of the Avengers to form a character known as Wanda Zatara, the White Witch. Batman: Holy Terror In Batman: Holy Terror, a world where Oliver Cromwell's Church never fell and the world is ruled by a totalitarian religious group known as the Privy Council, Zatanna is an agent of the council, using her 'sin' in the service of the state to capture other superhumans, but she is defeated by Batman. While focusing on defeating Barry Allen, Batman throws a gas pellet down her throat. JLA: Another Nail She appears in JLA: Another Nail, which shows her teaming with Hawkwoman in Midway City. Flashpoint In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Zatanna is a member of the Secret Seven and is a member of a motorcycle gang. Her father, Giovanni \\"John\\" Zatara, is transformed into a motorcycle when Zatanna is riding on him. Zatanna is killed while trying to cast a death spell on Enchantress. Smallville: Harbinger Zatanna stars in the four-issue mini series, Smallville: Harbinger. Looking for her father's Book of Magick in England, she meets John Constantine for the first time. They team up to rescue Rachel Roth and retrieve the Book of Magick from Brother Blood. Similar to the TV show, her spells are spoken entirely backwards. DC Bombshells In the DC Bombshells continuity, Zatanna was the daughter of a Jewish father and a Romani mother during World War II, but was prevented from being sent to the concentration camps thanks to the Joker's Daughter, who in return, forced her to perform magic to aid the Third Reich. Her lover, John Constantine, confronted her during one of her shows in an attempt to rescue her, but knowing they were surrounded, Zatanna transformed John into a rabbit and kept him under her care to prevent his death. He eventually convinces her to use her magic to aid the Allies, which she does by transforming her soul into a large, spiritual dove that aids Batwoman in freeing a refugee camp. Their attempts are discovered by the Nazis, and the two are depowered of their magic (with John being turned back into a human) and sent into the ghettos. Zatanna slowly gains her powers back over time, and finds a kindred spirit in another magic user imprisoned by the Joker's Daughter, Raven. They eventually defeat and depower the Joker's Daughter after allying herself with the Bombshells. Mystik U A college-aged alternate version of Zatanna is the lead character in the DC limited series Mystik U written by Alisa Kwitney and illustrated by Mike Norton. The Zatanna of this continuity enrolls in Mystik University, a school for magic users, alongside other magical DC characters like Enchantress, Sargon the Sorcerer, and her love interest in the series, Sebastian Faust. The students of the school must figure out which of them is destined to betray the others and become a force of evil. DC Books for Young Readers In 2019, DC announced two stand-alone Zatanna graphic novel titles for its Books for Young Readers program. The first, Zatanna and the House of Secrets, written by Matthew Cody and illustrated by Yoshi Yoshitani, was released in February 2020. The story features a middle-school aged Zatanna who lives in the House of Secrets with her father. Zatanna must protect her pet rabbit, Pocus, from Klarion the Witch Boy, and then rescue her father from Klarion's mother, the Witch Queen. The second Zatanna stand-alone young adult title, Zatanna: The Jewel of Gravesend, is written by Alys Arden and illustrated by Jacqueline de Leon. It is due to be released in April 2021, and features a young Zatanna whose \\"fun in Luna Park comes to an end when a mystic‚Äôs quest for a powerful jewel unravels everything Zatanna thought she knew about herself and her beloved neighborhood. Mysteries and magic surround her as she reveals the truth about her family‚Äôs legacy, and confronts the illusion that has been cast over her entire life.\\" In other media Television Animation *Zatanna has made multiple appearances in the DC Animated Universe: Zatanna as seen on Justice League Unlimited.  Zatanna first appears in a Batman: The Animated Series episode, voiced by Julie Brown. She is an illusionist with no apparent magic powers. She developed a close relationship with Bruce Wayne (using the alias John Smith) during the years in which Bruce was traveling the globe learning skills from Zatanna's father that later serves well as Batman; in particular, escape artistry. In the episode \\"Zatanna\\", she visits Gotham City with her magic show, but finds herself being framed by criminal magic debunker Montague Kane. Batman helps Zatanna clear her name, and by the end of their confrontation with Kane, she realizes Batman is really \\"John Smith\\". At the end of the episode, the two promise to keep in touch, as dear friends.  Zatanna makes two appearances in the Gotham Girls flash animation episodes, voiced by Stacie Randall. In \\"A Little Night Magic\\", Zatanna walks home on her own after a magic show and has some adventures on the way: She turns a robber's gun into a snake, splits a truck in half when it almost runs her over, and turns some street thugs into toads after they take her hat. In \\"Hold the Tiger\\", Zatanna stops Catwoman from stealing the Cat's Eye Opals from a jewelry store. Zatanna does not arrest Catwoman but instead asks for help in finding her white tiger.  Zatanna made a cameo appearance in Batman Beyond. In the episode \\"Out of the Past\\", an elderly Bruce Wayne is looking through a collection of pictures on his computer of past loves, alongside Lois Lane, Catwoman, and Barbara Gordon.  Zatanna reappears in the Justice League Unlimited, voiced by Jennifer Hale (in \\"This Little Piggy\\") and by Juliet Landau (in \\"The Balance\\", albeit uncredited). In \\"This Little Piggy\\", she helps Batman search for Circe after the villainess turned Wonder Woman into a pig. Zatanna is apparently aware of Batman's true identity since her last appearance (\\"Bruce! I haven't seen you for so long...\\") and knows well enough to perceive the Dark Knight's romantic relationship with Wonder Woman. It's revealed that after her encounter with Batman that she somehow came across actual magic power, which she now uses to help people as a crimefighter and secretly uses them at the same time during her magic show tours for public entertainment. Like her comic book counterpart, her spells are often cast backwards, but almost equally often cast without words, and on one occasion, speaking normally. Zatanna also appeared in \\"The Balance\\" amongst the magic-based superheroes affected by the disturbance in the magical balance. In \\"Destroyer\\", Zatanna appears as one of many Justice League members called to help fight the invading Apokoliptan forces. DCAU writer Paul Dini wrote both of Zatanna's appearances described above. In 1998, Alan Burnett told Wizard: \\"Paul Dini wanted to use Zatanna because he‚Äôs secretly in love with her. It‚Äôs something we try not to talk about too much\\". Teenage Zatanna in Cartoon Monsoon * Two episodes of a Cartoon Monsoon contest entry feature Zatanna as a teenage hero who is a cross between Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, voiced by Tara Strong. This saw her match wits with Klarion the Witch Boy, and featured her father (referred to only as \\"Zatara\\") as well as the new character of Zatanna's older, non-magic-wielding brother (named \\"Damon\\" in the second episode). * Zatanna appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, with Jennifer Hale reprising her role. In the teaser of \\"Chill of the Night!\\", she and Batman stop Abra Kadabra from robbing a museum exhibit displaying the history of magicians. Though she relies primarily on vocal spells, she is shown to be able to effectively wield Kadabra's magic wand after Abra gags her mouth shut and when she tries to remove it she pulls out a stream of handkerchiefs stuffed in her mouth. Zatanna gets Kadabra's wand and makes the handkerchiefs disappear, then snaps the wand. While Batman holds back the mind control slaves, Zatanna battles Kadabra, and traps Abra in her hat. She later pulls out a tiny bird cage with Kadabra in it, winning the magic battle. This version wears a slightly modified version of her original outfit, with her trademark fishnets replaced by purple tights. * Zatanna appears in the Young Justice cartoon series, voiced by Lacey Chabert. This version is only thirteen years old, and as such her romantic entanglements involving Batman are instead transferred to Robin. In the episode \\"Humanity\\", Zatara initially brings Zatanna to Mount Justice in Happy Harbor to meet the team, and asks the kids give Zatanna a tour of Mount Justice. They pretend to go along with that request, quickly use Miss Martian's ship to leave the cave and track down Red Tornado with Zatanna, referring to her departure with them as \\"kidnapping\\". Zatara was displeased that his daughter went on a mission with the team. Robin seems to have an interest in her. She returns in the episode \\"Secrets\\", where she and Artemis head to Manhattan on Halloween night. They are ambushed and eventually kidnapped by Harm, a psychotic teenager wielding the mystical sword of Beowulf, who then binds and gags Zatanna. While Harm interrogates Artemis, Zatanna fruitlessly attempts to conjure a spell through her gag. The ghost of Harm's murdered sister, Secret, soon appears and removes the tape from Zatanna's mouth, allowing her to rescue Artemis. Together, the three girls defeat Harm and allow Secret's spirit to move on to the afterlife. Afterwards, Zatanna promises to erect a proper grave for Secret, who had previously been buried in Harm's backyard. In episode \\"Misplaced\\", Zatanna is with the team when all the adults disappear. She is able to use a spell to locate Klarion the Witch Boy on Roanoke Island. As her powers seem ineffective against Klarion (he refers to them as \\"baby magic\\"), she dons the Helmet of Fate as a last-ditch effort. After Klarion escapes, Nabu refuses to relinquish Zatanna as his host, until her father offers himself as Nabu's host. After making Batman promise to take care of her, Zatara dons the helmet and leaves Zatanna with the rest of the team. She then moves into Mount Justice with Miss Martian and Superboy and joins the team full-time. She is shown to be clearly devastated by the loss of her father. In \\"Happy New Year\\", she and Rocket are now shown as adult members of the Justice League. In the episode \\"Depths\\", Nightwing implies a past romantic relationship between them to explain why she was willing to provide him with an enchanted amulet without asking for its purpose. In \\"Satisfaction\\", Zatanna and Miss Martian attend Rocket's bridal shower, and fight Captain Cold alongside Bumblebee, Black Canary, Wonder Girl, and Batgirl. In the episode \\"Cornered\\", Zatanna, Captain Marvel, and the team battle Despero in the Hall of Justice. She helps by possessing Mal and backfiring Despero's powers on himself. In \\"Intervention\\", she assists Rocket in capturing Blue Beetle and releasing him from the Reach. * Zatanna appears in Mad. In episode 46, Zatanna is among the superheroes that ask Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman about being called \\"Super Friends\\". In episode 50, Zatanna (voiced by Tara Strong) appears on a skit called \\"Potions 11\\" where she teams up with Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger for their heist. * Zatanna appears only in the intro of the Robot Chicken DC Comics Special with the Justice League. * Zatanna appears in Justice League Action, with Lacey Chabert reprising the role while her child form is voiced by Dayci Brookshire. In the episode \\"Zombie King\\", she and Swamp Thing help Batman fight Solomon Grundy when he raises an army of zombies with a magical gem. In \\"Trick or Threat\\", she, Batman, Doctor Fate, and John Constantine are turned into children by Klarion the Witch Boy so that he can lure them into a trap at the House of Mystery and steal the Helmet of Fate. In \\"Speed Demon\\", Zatanna helps Batman defeat Harley Quinn who had been enchanted by Brother Night. During the confrontation with Brother Night, Ember, and the rest of Brother Night's followers, Brother Night enchants the Batmobile where it wraps and gags, Zatanna while separating her from her hat and takes her on a ride causing Batman to enlist Etrigan the Demon for help. After Batman and Etrigan the Demon free Zatanna and have both the enchanted Batmobile and the ice cream truck that was enchanted by Merlin teleported to Brother Night's lair, Brother Night and his followers get away as Batman and Zatanna claim the enchanted orb that Brother Night used on the Batmobile that he left behind. In the episode \\"Hat Trick\\", Zatanna was helping Batman and Jason Blood fight the possessed mannequins until Felix Faust appears and makes off with her hat. Upon tracing Felix Faust to the Hebrides, Batman, Zatanna, and Etrigan the Demon are transported there by Merlin. Once there, they find that Felix Faust is using Zatanna's hat to summon the demon Ghast on the world as a way to regain his youth. Once that was done, Zatanna engages Felix Faust in battle while Batman and Etrigan the Demon work to prevent Ghast from reaching the mainland. As Felix Faust animates a gargoyle, Zatanna uses every trick in her arsenal where she destroys the gargoyle and chains Felix Faust up with the chains she conjured. Once Zatanna regains her hat, she casts a spell to send Ghast back to where he came from. * Zatanna appears as a central protagonist in the DC Super Hero Girls TV series. The voice role is reprised by Kari Wahlgren. In this series, she's a teenager at Metropolis High, has purple hair and is both a dramatic fashionista (providing Wonder Woman with her alter ego as Greek exchange student, Diana Prince) and an entertainer for birthday parties. While Zatanna's personality is based on her Young Justice counterpart, she is not a rebel type but still loves her father. * Zatanna has a minor, non-speaking role in Harley Quinn. In \\"So You Need A Crew?\\", she appears in a flashback where she helps the Justice League defeat the Queen of Fables by sealing her in a U.S. Master Tax Guide Book. In \\"The Line\\", a court order forces her to release Queen of Fables from the book. In \\"A Fight Worth Fighting For\\", Zatanna is called by Batman to release the other members of the Justice League, who were prievously imprisoned in a book by the Queen of Fables, before leaving with them to defeat Doctor Psycho and his army of Parademons. Live-action Serinda Swan as Zatanna Zatara in Smallville. Zatanna is a recurring character in the final three seasons of Smallville, portrayed by actress Serinda Swan, marking her first appearance in live-action. The character first appeared late in season eight, in the episode \\"Hex\\". She is described as the daughter of the deceased John Zatara, \\"the world's greatest magician\\". Zatanna is introduced at the Ace of Clubs, the scene of Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack)'s birthday party. To enliven things, Zatanna uses magic to make characters' inner desires come true‚ÄîChloe is physically transformed to resemble her cousin, Lois Lane (Erica Durance), for example, and Clark (Tom Welling) becomes \\"normal\\". Zatanna later approaches Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) and offers him a deal: she will grant him a wish if he returns her father's magical book to her. Once she acquires the Book of Zatara from Green Arrow, whom she recognizes as Oliver, she reveals her aim is to use it to resurrect her father. Because Clark is vulnerable to magic, and Oliver lacks the power to stop her, Zatanna has to realize for herself that her father sacrificed himself so she could live. She later goes to Oliver to explain herself, and decides to help him if he encounters any supernatural foes along the way by leaving him her phone number. Swan reprises the role in the ninth season of Smallville in the episode titled \\"Warrior\\". In season ten episodes which feature the government attempting to hunt down the Justice League, Zatanna's picture is shown among their targets. Although not portrayed by Swan, an actor in costume represents Zatanna in the episode \\"Icarus\\". In the episode \\"Fortune\\", Zatanna is used as a plot device; the episode establishes her as having sent an enchanted bottle of wine to Clark and Lois on the night of their engagement party, which sets the events of that episode in motion.

He played in 11 One Day Internationals. He was a middle-order left-handed batsman and an occasional slow left arm orthodox bowler. Rohan is the son of Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar. Domestic career Gavaskar batted left-handed, and bowled a slow, gentle left-arm spin that picked up crucial wickets at times for Bengal. He spent many years in the shadow of his more illustrious father, Sunil. In Indian domestic cricket, he represented Bengal in the Ranji Trophy, and East Zone in the Duleep Trophy. Since Mumbai had great batting line-up at that time and he wouldn't have got the opportunity to play first-class cricket for Mumbai immediately. He would have to wait for another one or two years, which he didn't want to. Bengal gave him that opportunity and he grabbed it.Father's cricket genes propelled Rohan Gavaskar ‚Äì NDTV Sports His first- class average keeps him forever on the fringes of higher honours, and he was a serious contender for a national one-day slot for quite a while before he finally got his chance, against Australia in the 2003‚Äì04 VB Series. He was dropped for the subsequent tour to Pakistan, he was again tried at the start of the 2004‚Äì05 season. Appointed captain of Bengal in 2001‚Äì02 but the two seasons as leader were poor. He was having regret for not winning the Ranji Trophy for Bengal. They were twice in the finals in consecutive years, but couldn't win it. In 2007, Gavaskar signed a contract with Indian Cricket League, playing for the Kolkata Tigers which was declared unauthorised by BCCI. After breaking his links with the league, and returning to mainstream Indian domestic cricket, he was selected to play in the third season of the Indian Premier League for the Kolkata Knight Riders. He played in his last first class match in 2009 and retired in 2012. He was one among the 71 players granted amnesty by the BCCI in June 2009, marking his return to the official fold. Gavaskar announced his retirement from first-class cricket on 9 February 2012. Rohan, who played his first-class cricket for Bengal, scored 5073 runs in 75 matches at 51.24. International career Gavaskar was selected for the Indian cricket team to tour Australia in 2004, and made his ODI debut after Mohammad Kaif was forced out of the team due to injury. He did not make a lasting impression on the international game, and his last ODI came during the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy. Media career Like his father, Rohan followed commentating career post-retirement. He has been seen on doing commentary in IPL 2013 and shows on Star Sports' Star Power and NDTV's sports show.

The X-33 was a technology demonstrator for the VentureStar orbital spaceplane, which was planned to be a next-generation, commercially operated reusable launch vehicle. The X-33 would flight-test a range of technologies that NASA believed it needed for single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicles (SSTO RLVs), such as metallic thermal protection systems, composite cryogenic fuel tanks for liquid hydrogen, the aerospike engine, autonomous (uncrewed) flight control, rapid flight turn-around times through streamlined operations, and its lifting body aerodynamics. Failures of its 21-meter wingspan and multi-lobed, composite-material fuel tank during pressure testing ultimately led to the withdrawal of federal support for the program in early 2001. Lockheed Martin has conducted unrelated testing, and has had a single success after a string of failures as recently as 2009 using a 2-meter scale model.  History In 1994 NASA initiated the Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) program, which among other things led to the development of the X-33 within a few years.Reusable Launch Vehicle Another important vehicle in this program was the Orbital Sciences X-34, which was developed concurrently with the X-33 by 1996. Goals of the RLV program: *To \\"demonstrate technologies leading to a new generation of space boosters capable of delivering payloads at significantly lower cost\\" *To \\"provide a technology base for development of advanced commercial launch systems that will make U.S. aerospace manufacturers more competitive in the global market.\\" The proposals for the X-33 included designs from: *Rockwell *Lockheed Martin *McDonnell Douglas The X-33 contract was awarded to LM in 1996, and $1 billion was spent through 1999 with about 80 percent coming from NASA and additional money contributed by private companies. The goal was to have a first flight by 1999, and an operating space vehicle by 2005. There were three design proposals submitted for the X-33, and the L.M. version won and was further developed.X-33 Contractor Design Proposals Sept 2009 Shows all three proposals The Lockheed Martin proposal was chosen on July 2, 1996. However, the X-33 program was cancelled in early 2001 after the project had problems with a carbon composite hydrogen fuel tank.X-33 Proposal by McDonnell Douglas - Computer Graphic Sept 2009 The program was managed by the NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. Several years after it was cancelled the problems with hydrogen fuel tank were resolved by aerospace companies.Northrop Grumman. \\"Northrop Grumman, NASA Complete Testing of Prototype Composite Cryogenic Fuel Tank\\", News Releases, September 7, 2004, accessed January 9, 2017.

A spacecraft capable of reaching orbit in a single stage would not require external fuel tanks or boosters to reach low Earth orbit. Doing away with the need for \\"staging\\" with launch vehicles, such as with the Shuttle and the Apollo rockets, would lead to an inherently more reliable and safer space launch vehicle. While the X-33 would not approach airplane-like safety, the X-33 would attempt to demonstrate 0.997 reliability, or 3 mishaps out of 1,000 launches, which would be an order of magnitude more reliable than the Space Shuttle. The 15 planned experimental X-33 flights could only begin this statistical evaluation. X-33 launch facility already completed at Edwards Air Force Base. The uncrewed craft would have been launched vertically from a specially designed facility constructed on Edwards Air Force Base, and landed horizontally (VTHL) on a runway at the end of its mission. Initial sub-orbital test flights were planned from Edwards AFB to Dugway Proving Grounds southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah. Once those test flights were completed, further flight tests were to be conducted from Edwards AFB to Malmstrom AFB in Great Falls, Montana, to gather more complete data on aircraft heating and engine performance at higher speeds and altitudes. On 2 July 1996, NASA selected Lockheed Martin Skunk Works of Palmdale, California, to design, build, and test the X-33 experimental vehicle for the RLV program. Lockheed Martin's design concept for the X-33 was selected over competing concepts from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. Boeing proposed a Space Shuttle-derived design, and McDonnell Douglas proposed a design based on its vertical takeoff and landing (VTVL) DC-XA test vehicle. The uncrewed X-33 was slated to fly 15 suborbital hops to near 75.8 km altitude. It was to be launched upright like a rocket and rather than having a straight flight path it would fly diagonally up for half the flight, reaching extremely high altitudes, and then for the rest of the flight glide back down to a runway. The X-33 was never intended to fly higher than an altitude of 100 km, nor faster than one-half of orbital velocity. Had any successful tests occurred, extrapolation would have been necessary to apply the results to a proposed orbital vehicle. The decision to design and build the X-33 grew out of an internal NASA study titled \\"Access to Space\\". Unlike other space transport studies, \\"Access to Space\\" was to result in the design and construction of a vehicle.  Commercial spaceflight  Based on the X-33 experience shared with NASA, Lockheed Martin hoped to make the business case for a full-scale SSTO RLV, called VentureStar, that would be developed and operated through commercial means. The intention was that rather than operate space transport systems as it has with the Space Shuttle, NASA would instead look to private industry to operate the reusable launch vehicle and NASA would purchase launch services from the commercial launch provider. Thus, the X-33 was not only about honing space flight technologies, but also about successfully demonstrating the technology required to make a commercial reusable launch vehicle possible. The VentureStar was to be the first commercial aircraft to fly into space. The VentureStar was intended for long inter-continental flights and supposed to be in service by 2012, but this project was never funded or begun. Aerospike engine test at Stennis Space Center, August 6, 2001  Cancellation  The program was cancelled in February 2001. The main reason for this was reported as being a delay caused in completing the fuel tanks. Construction of the prototype was some 85% assembled with 96% of the parts and the launch facility 100% complete when the program was canceled by NASA in 2001, after a long series of technical difficulties including flight instability and excess weight. In particular, the composite liquid hydrogen fuel tank failed during testing in November 1999. The tank was constructed of honeycomb composite walls and internal structures to reduce its weight. A lighter tank was needed for the craft to demonstrate necessary technologies for single-stage-to-orbit operations. A hydrogen fueled SSTO craft's mass fraction requires that the weight of the vehicle without fuel be 10% of the fully fueled weight. This would allow a vehicle to fly to low Earth orbit without the need for the sort of external boosters and fuel tanks used by the Space Shuttle. But, after the composite tank failed on the test stand during fueling and pressure tests, NASA came to the conclusion that the technology of the time was simply not advanced enough for such a design. While the composite tank walls themselves were lighter, the odd hydrogen tank shape resulted in complex joints increasing the total mass of the composite tank to above that of an aluminum-based tank. Microcracking problem discovered in the liquid-hydrogen (LH2) multi-lobed tank core by NASA scientists at Goddard Space Flight Center ultimately caused NASA to cancel the X-33 program NASA had invested $922 million in the project before cancellation, and Lockheed Martin a further $357 million. Due to changes in the space launch business‚Äîincluding the challenges faced by companies such as Globalstar, Teledesic, and Iridium and the resulting drop in the anticipated number of commercial satellite launches per year‚ÄîLockheed Martin deemed that continuing development of the X-33 privately without government support would not be profitable.  Continued research  After the cancellation in 2001, engineers were able to make a working liquid-oxygen tank from carbon-fiber composite. Tests showed that composites were feasible materials for liquid- oxygen tanks On September 7, 2004, Northrop Grumman and NASA engineers unveiled a liquid-hydrogen tank made of carbon-fiber composite material that had demonstrated the ability for repeated fuelings and simulated launch cycles. Northrop Grumman concluded that these successful tests have enabled the development and refinement of new manufacturing processes that will allow the company to build large composite tanks without an autoclave; and design and engineering development of conformal fuel tanks appropriate for use on a single-stage-to-orbit vehicle.  The alternative proposals  Five companies expressed interest and proposed concepts. Of those five Lockheed Martin, Rockwell and McDonnell Douglas were selected for workup into more detailed proposals.X33; Wade Rockwell Rockwell proposed a Space Shuttle-derived design.Rockwell International X-33 Technology Demonstrator Proposal image It would have used one Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) and two RL-10-5A engines. In a subsequent full-scale system to reach orbit Rockwell planned to use six Rocketdyne RS-2100 engines. McDonnell Douglas McDonnell Douglas featured a design using liquid oxygen/hydrogen bell engines based on its vertical takeoff and landing DC-XA test vehicle. It would have used a single SSME for the main propulsion system.RAND 1995 Project Air Force Workshop on transatmospheric vehicles - chapter 3Full 1995 RAND TAV workshop proceedings  See also  * Armadillo Aerospace * Blue Origin * Blue Origin New Shepard * Bristol Spaceplanes * Interorbital Systems * Kankoh-maru * List of NASA cancellations * Lunar Lander Challenge * Masten Space Systems * McDonnell Douglas DC-X * Quad (rocket) * Reusable Vehicle Testing program by JAXA * Skylon (spacecraft) * Space Shuttle retirement * Zarya References  External links   . * . * . * . * X-033 Category:Cancelled aircraft projects Category:Lifting bodies Category:Rocket-powered aircraft Category:Spaceplanes Category:Single-stage-to-orbit Category:Edwards Air Force Base Category:Proposed reusable launch systems ","title":"Lockheed Martin X-33"},{"id":"559339","text":"An example of a tie-dyed T-shirt A video about how to tie-dye Tie-dye is a modern term invented in the mid-1960s in the United States (but recorded in writing in an earlier form in 1941 as \\"tied-and-dyed\\", and 1909 as \\"tied and dyed\\" by Luis C. Changsut, referenced below)\\"Orphans of the Pacific\\", a book about Philippines published in 1941, referring to tie-dying among the Bagobo tribe: \\"There are a few thousand Bagobos, who wear highly decorated clothing made of hemp fiber, all tied-and-dyed into fancy designs, and who further ornament themselves with big metal disks.\\" for a set of ancient resist-dyeing techniques, and for the products of these processes. The process of tie-dye typically consists of folding, twisting, pleating, or crumpling fabric or a garment and binding with string or rubber bands, followed by application of dye(s).https://web.archive.org/web/20030607054739/http://textilemuseum.org/PDFs/TextileTerms.pdf The manipulations of the fabric prior to the application of dye are called resists, as they partially or completely prevent the applied dye from coloring the fabric. More sophisticated tie-dyes involve additional steps, including an initial application of dye prior to the resist, multiple sequential dye and resist steps, and the use of other types of resists (stitching, stencils) and discharge. Unlike regular resist-dyeing techniques, tie-dye is characterized by the use of bright, saturated primary colors and bold patterns. These patterns, including the spiral, mandala, and peace sign, and the use of multiple bold colors, have become clich√©d since the peak popularity of tie-dye in the 1960s and 1970s. The vast majority of currently produced tie-dyes use these designs, and many are mass-produced for wholesale distribution. However, a new interest in more 'sophisticated' tie-dye is emerging in the fashion industry, characterized by simple motifs, monochromatic color schemes, and a focus on fashionable garments and fabrics other than cotton. A few artists continue to pursue tie-dye as an art form rather than a commodity. Dyes, fabrics, and discharge agents A variety of dyes are used in tie-dyeing, including household, fiber reactive, acid, and vat dyes. Most early (1960s) tie-dyes were made with retail household dyes, particularly those made by Rit. In order to be effective on different fibers, these dyes are composed of several different dyes, and thus are less effective, and more likely to bleed and fade, than pure dyes designed for specific fibers. This is the basis for the famous 'pink socks' phenomenon that occurs when fabrics dyed with mixed dyes are washed with other garments. Most tie-dyes are now dyed with Procion MX fiber reactive dyes, a class of dyes effective on cellulose fibers such as cotton, hemp, rayon, and linen. This class of dyes reacts with fibers at alkaline (high) pH, forming a wash-fast, permanent bond. Soda ash (sodium carbonate) is the most common agent used to raise the pH and initiate the reaction, and is either added directly to the dye, or in a solution of water in which garments are soaked before dyeing. Procion dyes are relatively safe and simple to use, and are the same dyes used commercially to color cellulosic fabrics. Protein-based fibers such as silk, wool, and feathers, as well as the synthetic polyamide fiber, nylon, can be dyed with acid dyes. As may be expected from the name, acid dyes are effective at acidic (low) pH, where they form ionic bonds with the fiber. Acid dyes are also relatively safe (some are used as food dyes) and simple to use. Vat dyes, including indigo, are a third class of dyes that are effective on cellulosic fibers and silk. Vat dyes are insoluble in water in their unreduced form, and the vat dye must be chemically reduced before they can be used to color fabric. This is accomplished by heating the dye in a strongly basic solution of sodium hydroxide (lye) or sodium carbonate (caustic potash) containing a reducing agent such as sodium hydrosulfite or thiourea dioxide. The fabric is immersed in the dye bath, and after removal the vat dye oxidizes to its insoluble form, binding with high wash-fastness to the fiber. However, vat dyes, and especially indigo, must be treated after dyeing by 'soaping' to prevent the dye from rubbing (crocking) off. Vat dyes can be used to simultaneously dye the fabric and to remove underlying fiber-reactive dye (i.e., can dye a black cotton fabric yellow) because of the bleaching action of the reducing bath (see below). The extra complexity and safety issues (particularly when using strong bases such as lye) restrict use of vat dyes in tie-dye to experts. Discharge agents are used to bleach color from the previously-dyed fabrics, and can be used as a reverse tie-dye, where application of the agent results in loss of color rather than its application. Household bleach (sodium hypochlorite) can be used to discharge fiber reactive dyes on bleach-resistant fibers such as cotton or hemp (but not on wool or silk), though the results are variable, as some fiber reactive dyes are more resistant to bleach than others. It is important to bleach as long as required to obtain the desired shade (which will be lighter than observed on wet, unwashed fabric), and to neutralize the bleach with agents such as sodium bisulfite, to prevent damage to the fibers. Thiourea dioxide is another commonly used discharge agent that can be used on cotton, wool, or silk. A thiourea dioxide discharge bath is made with hot water made mildly basic with sodium carbonate. The results of thiourea dioxide discharge differ significantly from bleach discharge due to the nature of the reaction. Since thiourea dioxide only bleaches in the absence of oxygen, and the fabric to be bleached retains oxygen, a fractal pattern of bleaching will be observed. This is in distinct contrast with household bleach discharge, where the bleaching agent penetrates fabric easily (particularly in bleach formulations containing detergent). For example, pleating fabric multiple times and clamping on a resist will yield a clear design after outlining the resist with household bleach, but discharge with reducing agents will only partially penetrate the resisted area. In general, discharge techniques, particularly using household bleach, are a readily accessible way to tie-dye without use of often messy and relatively expensive dyes. It is particularly easy to put design on cloth using stencils and sprayed-on solutions of household bleach, but the intricate and unintended results of discharge using reducing agents often surpasses the results of oxidizing discharge techniques. Designs and patterns Tie-dye can be used to create a wide variety of designs on fabric, from standard patterns such as the spiral, peace sign, diamond, and the marble effect to beautiful works of art. Using techniques such as stencils (a la screen printing using dyes or discharge pastes), clamped-on shaped blocks, and tritik (stitching and gathering), tie-dye can produce almost any design desired. If a modern kit is used, then it is easier to accomplish a spiral or circle. History Earliest examples The earliest examples in the Far East are from V century China. The earliest surviving examples of pre-Columbian tie-dye in Peru date from 500 to 810 AD. Their designs include small circles and lines, with bright colors including red, yellow, blue, and green. Asia Example of Mudmee tie-dye, an art form originating in ThailandShibori is a form of tie-dye which originated in Japan. It has been practiced there since the 8th century. Shibori includes a number of labor-intensive resist techniques which include stitching elaborate patterns and tightly gathering the stitching before dyeing, forming intricate designs for kimonos. Another shibori method is to wrap the fabric around a core of rope, wood or other material, and bind it tightly with string or thread. The areas of the fabric that are against the core or under the binding would remain undyed. In the 1941 book \\"Orphans of the Pacific\\", about Philippines, it was noted: \\"There are a few thousand Bagobos, who wear highly decorated clothing made of hemp fiber, all tied-and-dyed into fancy designs, and who further ornament themselves with big metal disks.\\" Plangi and tritik are Indonesian words, derived from Japanese words, for methods related to tie- dye, and 'bandhna' a term from India, giving rise to the Bandhani fabrics of Kutch. Ikat is a method of tie-dyeing the warp or weft before the cloth is woven. Mudmee tie-dye originates in Thailand and neighboring part of Laos. It uses different shapes and colors from other types of tie-dye, and the colors are, in general, more subdued. Another difference is that the base color is black. Africa Tie-dye techniques have also been used for centuries in the Hausa region of West Africa, with renowned indigo dye pits located in and around Kano, Nigeria. The tie-dyed clothing is then richly embroidered in traditional patterns. It has been suggested that these African techniques were the inspiration for the tie-dyed garments identified with hippie fashion. Tie-dye in the Western world Tie dye vendor, July 2013 A tie-dyed lab coat Tie-dyeing was known in the US by 1909, when Professor Charles E. Pellow of Columbia University acquired some samples of tie-dyed muslin and subsequently gave a lecture and live demonstration of the technique. Although shibori and batik techniques were used occasionally in Western fashion before the 1960s, modern psychedelic tie-dying did not become a fad until the late 1960s following the example set by rock stars such as Janis Joplin and John Sebastian (who did his own dyeing). The 2011 film documentary Magic Trip, which shows amateur film footage taken during the 1964 cross-country bus journey of countercultural icon Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters, shows the travelers developing a form of tie-dye by taking LSD beside a pond and pouring enamel-based model airplane paint into it, before placing a white T-shirt upon the surface of the water. Although the process is closer to paper marbling, in the accompanying narrative, the travelers claim credit for inventing tie- dyeing. Tie-dying, particularly after the introduction of affordable Rit dyes, became popular as a cheap and accessible way to customize inexpensive T-shirts, singlets, dresses, jeans, army surplus clothing, and other garments into psychedelic creations. Some of the leading names in tie-dye at this time were Water Baby Dye Works (run by Ann Thomas and Maureen Mubeem), Bert Bliss, and Up Tied, the latter winning a Coty Award for \\"major creativity in fabrics\\" in 1970. Up Tied created tie-dyed velvets and silk chiffons which were used for exclusive one-of-a-kind garments by Halston, Donald Brooks, and Gayle Kirkpatrick, whilst another tie-dyer, Smooth Tooth Inc. dyed garments for Dior and Jonathan Logan. In late 1960s London, Gordon Deighton created tie-dyed shirts and trousers for young fashionable men which he sold through the Simpsons of Piccadilly department store in London.

The characters first appeared in a 16-page special insert in The New Teen Titans #16 (February 1982), followed by a series published from 1982 to 1983. The Zoo Crew characters were created by Roy Thomas and Scott Shaw! Although the series, which was the last original funny animal property to be created by DC Comics, proved short-lived, it is still fondly remembered by many comic fans of its generation, and the characters appear occasionally in cameos in the mainstream DC Universe (this is made possible due to the existence of a \\"multiverse\\" in the DCU, which allows the Zoo Crew characters to exist on a parallel Earth). The series was introduced in a 16-page insert in The New Teen Titans #16. The series was cancelled after 20 issues, with six issues still in preparation. These six issues were eventually published in three double-sized issues as Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! in The Oz-Wonderland War #1-3, with the indicia title Oz-Wonderland Wars (plural). The series did not, in fact, depict a conflict between the Land of Oz and Wonderland, which plotter E. Nelson Bridwell considered antithetical to Ozite politics, but rather depicted the Nome King retrieving the magic belt and using his powers against both Oz and Wonderland, with the Zoo Crew coming in as reinforcements against him. The series was praised for its artwork, by Carol Lay, for its close emulation of the work of John R. Neill and Sir John Tenniel, but the story, scripted by Joey Cavalieri, was seen by many to be too close to the plot of Ozma of Oz to reach its full potential. The series featured cameos from both Hoppy the Marvel Bunny and the Inferior Five. A Showcase Presents reprinting of the entire series was slated for September 2007 but was postponed, along with several other Showcase editions, due to royalty issues in DC's contracts of the 1980s. The book was finally released in September 2014. After years of absence, the Zoo Crew was reintroduced in Teen Titans (vol. 3) #30-31 (December 2005-January 2006). In October‚ÄìDecember 2007, a three-issue miniseries called Captain Carrot and the Final Ark featured the Zoo Crew picking up from the Teen Titans storyline. Location The various members of the Zoo Crew lived on a parallel Earth that, during DC's Pre-Crisis Multiverse system, was named \\"Earth-C\\". Earth-C consisted of a world where various anthropomorphized talking animals existed; the series featured many animal- themed pun names for real-world aspects. For instance, the Zoo Crew operated out of \\"Follywood, Califurnia\\", a parody of Hollywood, California.The New Teen Titans #16 (February 1982) Similarly named Earth-C cities include \\"Gnu York\\" (New York City), \\"Tallahatchee\\" (Tallahassee, Florida),Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! #1 (March 1982) and \\"Loondon\\" (London).Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! #6 (August 1982) Countries on Earth-C include \\"Cornada\\" (Canada),Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! #3 (May 1982) and the \\"United Species of America\\" (United States of America); the capital of the United Species was \\"Waspington, D.C.\\" (Washington, D.C.). The President of the United Species of America was \\"Mallard Fillmore\\" (a reference to the 13th president of the United States, Millard Fillmore). Other famous figures of Earth-C included \\"Liz Whaler\\" (Elizabeth Taylor), \\"Marlin Brando\\" (Marlon Brando), \\"Byrd Rentals\\" (Burt Reynolds) and \\"Rova Barkitt\\" (Rona Barrett)-the last two of whom became members of the Zoo Crew as Rubberduck and Yankee Poodle, respectively. Historical figures and events on Earth-C also parallel those of the real world, including the \\"Second Weird War\\" (World War II; Earth-C's version featured the U.S. and the Allies fighting the \\"Ratzis\\" (Nazis))Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! #5 (July 1982) and President Abraham Linkidd (a goat, Earth-C's version of Abraham Lincoln), who was immortalized in the nation's capital in the \\"Linkidd Memorial\\". Earth-C's population also consisted of the various \\"funny animal\\" characters that appeared in DC Comics over the years, particularly those in such Golden Age and Silver Age DC titles as Funny Stuff, The Dodo and the Frog, Real Screen Comics, and so forth. Indeed, several characters from these series made cameo appearances during the run of Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!. One of those older characters, Peter Porkchops, was a member of the Zoo Crew itself as Pig-Iron. Reference was also made to Fastback's uncle being Merton McSnurtle, a Golden Age funny animal superhero known as the Terrific Whatzit.Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! #4 (June 1982) Eventually, readers (and the Zoo Crew) were introduced to the parallel Earth of \\"Earth-C- Minus\\", which turned out to be the home of the \\"Just'a Lotta Animals\\" (a parody of the Justice League of America) and whose world was an all-animal reflection of the universe of Earth-One in the original DC Multiverse. After the 1985 miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths, it was stated that the universes of Earth-C and Earth-C-Minus were actually \\"alternate dimensions\\" rather than parallel universes, and thus were spared from the effects of the Crisis. The miniseries The Kingdom presented Earth-C as a Hypertime reality. In the series Countdown to Final Crisis, the Monitors include one who has a neck and head that appears to resemble a giraffe's. There is an equivalent of Earth-C in the newly reestablished DC Multiverse, designated \\"Earth-26\\", with a history and population similar to that of the Pre-Crisis Earth-C. Origin The origin of the team came about when Superman was investigating a strange phenomenon causing the citizens of Metropolis to begin acting like their primate ancestors. He determined the cause to be rays of energy originating from the planet Pluto. Flying towards outer space, he encountered an energy barrier around the Earth, but after noticing a meteor pass through unaffected, he grabbed the meteor and attempted to use it to get him through the barrier. When Superman and the meteor struck the barrier, they were both shunted into an alternative dimension of \\"funny animals\\", later designated as Earth-C. There, Superman met several of the world's residents, who had gained superpowers when they were struck by the various meteorite fragments. The animals and Superman soon teamed up to stop the source of the ray (which was also causing the denizens of Earth-C to behave like their non-anthropomorphic animal ancestors), which turned out to be the old Justice League villain Starro the Conqueror, a starfish-shaped alien, who was launching his de- evolution assault from the Earth-C universe's Pluto. After defeating the villain, the animals decided to stick together and form the Zoo Crew, and Superman returned home. Unlike many superhero teams, the Zoo Crew initially had considerable difficulty fighting as a unit. For instance, they would often take on a foe in pairs, and find themselves interfering with each other and being put out of action as a result. However, as the series progressed, the Zoo Crew persevered to develop their tactics in order to become a coherent fighting force. Zoo Crew reunited In Teen Titans (vol. 3) #30-31 (December 2005-January 2006), the Zoo Crew made their first return appearance in some time, in stories presented as excerpts from a comic book story \\"Whatever Happened to Captain Carrot?\\" that Kid Devil reads in #30. In these excerpts, the Zoo Crew is shown to have mostly disbanded and now lives in a \\"darker\\" world than in their prior adventures. Little Cheese is dead. Yankee Poodle has lost her secret identity and is a fugitive from the law, accused of trying to assassinate President Mallard Fillmore. Fastback has disappeared, Pig-Iron and Rubberduck operate as underground superheroes against the current anti- superhero law and Captain Carrot is in self-imposed retirement after the death of his partner, Carrie Carrot, at the hands (or paws) of Armordillo and Frogzilla. He has not left his apartment in years, and drinks heavily out of guilt over Carrie's death. The only Zoo Crew member prospering is Alley-Kat Abra, who has revealed her identity publicly and become a world-famous magician. The story is a parody of the grim and gritty trend most often identified with the late 1980s to early 1990s superhero comics, and it includes references to several of DC's own series (such as Batman: The Dark Knight Returns and Watchmen, including the cover of the Captain Carrot comic, which bears a resemblance to the cover of Watchmen #1). A new hero, the American Eagle, overhears Pig-Iron, Rubberduck and Yankee Poodle at the scene of Little Cheese's murder when they decide to regroup in order to avenge him. Acting independently of them, he confronts Roger Rodney Rabbit and bullies him into becoming Captain Carrot again. The others are disappointed when Abra refuses to rejoin the team, but rejoice when the American Eagle brings Captain Carrot back to them. Their investigation reveals that the crimes against their members are connected. The president bribed Alley-Kat-Abra to reveal all of the Zoo Crew's secrets to the government; she took the money and made herself rich and famous. She banished Fastback into the future, killed Little Cheese and framed Yankee Poodle for the crime when she got too close to finding out what had happened to Fastback. When Alley-Kat-Abra is arrested for murdering Little Cheese, she tells them that she did it simply because she is a cat and cats hate mice. The Zoo Crew inducts the American Eagle as their newest member and heads into the future to retrieve Fastback. Issue #31 was drawn by ghost artist Scott Roberts. Many fans spotted the difference and complained. Scott Shaw! had, in fact, drawn the pages, before DC's switch to another artist. Countdown The Zoo Crew returned in a Countdown to Final Crisis tie-in entitled Captain Carrot and the Final Ark #1-3 (October‚ÄìDecember 2007). In the new DC Multiverse, the Zoo Crew now resides on Earth-26. It is revealed that they enlisted the aid of Chip Hunter, Time Master in a successful rescue of Fastback from the future. They returned to their own time to find major changes. President Mallard Fillmore's bribing of Alley-Kat-Abra was revealed and he resigned in shame. Vice President Beneduck Arnold took over and promptly created the Collar I.D. Initiative, (a parody of the Superhuman Registration Act storyline of Marvel Comics' Civil War crossover event), which required that all superheroes reveal their secret identities to the government and wear identity collars. The government immediately stopped funding the Zoo Crew, and they were forced to leave their headquarters and all of the equipment that came with it. The Zoo Crew officially resisted the Collar I.D. Initiative and refused to sign up, but fought crime on the sly. The Zoo Crew members restored both their civilian and their superhero identities. Roger Rodney Rabbit regained his status as a comic book artist/writer, but he had to stop writing Just'a Lotta Animals. Their attorney presented him with a cease and desist order, and he complied. Fastback started The World's Fastest Delivery Service. Rubberduck's acting career as Byrd Rentals was all but over, but he did get a reality TV show featuring him and other washed-up actors. The American Eagle continued his radio career as Johnny Jingo, \\"the radio talk show host with two right wings\\". Pig-Iron got a job working on an oil derrick, and Yankee Poodle became the highest-rated talk show host in the business after she was exonerated of all charges. The Zoo Crew operated briefly in defiance of the new law in a battle with the Salamandroid (at a comic book convention where Roger Rodney Rabbit was on a writers' panel) and again when they learn of a threat to destroy Gnu York's greatest landmarks. Frogzilla reappears in a dumbed-down state (reminiscent of the \\"Hulk smash!\\" version of the Hulk) and battles the Zoo Crew. During the fight, he swallows Pig-Iron. He is manipulated into vomiting Pig-Iron into a particular building, which houses a dimensional warp. The crash frees Alley-Kat-Abra from a netherworld. After defeating Frogzilla, Abra tells her former teammates that she was imprisoned there by Dark Alley, an evil version of herself created by the Just'a Lotta Animals foe Feline Faust. Dark Alley was the one who killed Little Cheese and framed Yankee Poodle for the crime. Pig-Iron vouches for her and tells them that she contacted him telepathically from the netherworld while he was in Frogzilla's belly and told him her escape plan. The team accepts her back as a probationary member (until they are sure that they can trust her again) and they promptly go to search for the Salamandroid's base under the ocean. Starro the Conqueror surprises them and uses his starfish duplicates to make them forget how to use their powers. Only Pig-Iron escaped-he could not go underwater for fear of rusting. Starro is working with Rash Al Paca to flood Earth-26 so that he can rule it. When President Arnold reveals that the ID collars have eliminated the powers of every superhero on Earth-26, the Zoo Crew summons the Just'a Lotta Animals for help. Green Lambkin leads a JLA team (including Hawkmoose, the Elon-Gator, the Crash, the Batmouse and Zap-Panda) to help, and they and the Zoo Crew fight in vain to stop the flood. They manage to evacuate a number of Gnu Yorkers using a huge ocean liner called Boa's Ark. As Pig-Iron stays behind battling Starro hoof to tentacle, Green Lambkin, Zap-Panda and the Crash combine their powers to transport the ship full of refugees to Earth-C-Minus. En route, the JLA encounters Muttron, Lightstray and Orihound of the New Dogs; while the two groups face off, the ship is accidentally sucked into the New Dogs' Kaboom Tube and sent to New Earth. Hawkgirl, Zatanna and the Red Arrow encounter the ship and land it safely, but all of the passengers, including the Zoo Crew, have been transformed into non-anthropomorphic animals. Zatanna takes Roger Rodney Rabbit to participate in her stage show, as the other transformed Zoo Crew members look on helplessly (a pig is among the transformed Crew, although Pig- Iron had not been on the ship when it left). Final Crisis In the climatic battle in Final Crisis #7, Monitor Nix Uotan restores the Zoo Crew to their anthropomorphic forms, speech and powers. Team members The members of the Zoo Crew include: *Roger Rodney Rabbit / Captain Carrot: A rabbit from Gnu York and leader of the team, who is often called Rodney so as to avoid confusion with the title character of the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit. After consuming one of his \\"cosmic carrots\\" (as Rodney called them), Rodney gains superpowers for roughly 24 hours, although major exertion could exhaust the powers sooner. His powers include superstrength, endurance, heightened hearing and vision senses and a super-powerful leap. As such, he is the only member who has to constantly replenish his powers and keeps a pair of carrots holstered on his belt for such a need in emergencies. The source of these carrots was initially a windowbox in which he grew the carrots, which one of the meteor fragments had struck. Later, he arranged a grow-op at the team headquarters to ensure an adequate continuous supply. In his alter ego, Rodney was the writer and artist of the comic book Just'a Lotta Animals, until its members sued for copyright violation and prevented any further reproductions of their adventures. *Felina Furr / Alley-Kat-Abra: A cat from Mew Orleans, martial arts instructor and student of the mystical arts. Felina uses her \\"Magic Wanda\\" to cast various types of spells. She has a crush on Rodney / Captain Carrot, and was relieved to see Wonder Wabbit (of Earth C-Minus) return to her own world due to her attraction to him. She was imprisoned by Feline Faust, unknown to her teammates, during which time an evil counterpart, \\"Dark Alley\\", impersonated her, murdered Little Cheese, and framed Yankee Poodle for the crime. *Peter Porkchops / Pig-Iron: A pig from Piggsburgh who was struck by a meteor fragment, and fell (along with the meteorite) into a vat of molten metal in the steel mill where he worked. The consequent chemical reaction transformed his now-enormous body into living steel, with strength and invulnerability to match. Peter was originally a character from an earlier series of DC \\"funny animal\\" comics. Pig-Iron is also nicknamed the \\"Swine of Steel\\" and the \\"Porcine Powerhouse\\". Pig-Iron remains behind on Earth-C in the Final Ark comic book series, fighting against Starro to save his friends. Despite this, a pig is shown alongside the rest of the Zoo Crew after they are transformed into non-anthropomorphic animals at the end of Final Ark, and Pig- Iron is shown as one of the Zoo Crew restored to his anthropomorphic form by Monitor Nix Uotan in Final Crisis #7. *Byrd Rentals / Rubberduck: A duck from Follywood, Califurnia, who was originally a movie star, and is given the power to stretch his body into any shape and length when a meteor fragment struck his hot tub when he was in it. Byrd Rentals' name is a parody of actor Burt Reynolds. Rubberduck is also nicknamed the \\"Malleable Mallard\\" and the \\"Ductile Duck\\". *Rova Barkitt / Yankee Poodle: A poodle who is also from Follywood, who worked as a gossip columnist (or as she prefers to call it, a \\"celebrity interviewer\\") and was interviewing Byrd when they were both struck by meteor fragments. Rova gained the ability to project a repelling force (in the form of blue stars) with one hand and an attraction force (in the form of red-and-white stripes) with the other. Rova Barkitt's name is a parody of gossip columnist Rona Barrett. *Timmy Joe Terrapin / Fastback: A turtle from the Okey-Dokey swamp in the American South, who while trying to catch a bus to Kornsas City, was struck by a meteor fragment and gained the ability to move at superchelonian speed. Fastback is also nicknamed the \\"Reptilian Rocket\\". Timmy Joe is not the first fast-moving turtle in his family. His uncle Merton McSnurtle was secretly the Terrific Whatzit, a superhero during the Second Weird War. One issue mentions McSnurtle's participation in \\"Operation Overlard\\". *Chester Cheese / Little Cheese: A mouse and student at Follywood High School, who has the ability to shrink from the comparable size of his teammates to a size of only a few centimeters, and was the only team member not to gain his powers from a meteor fragment (he gained his powers from eating a piece of experimental cheese brought back from Earth-C's Moon), as well as the first non-founding member. He soon revealed his secret identity to the public and left the Zoo Crew to become a lawyer. \\"Dark Alley\\", an evil version of Alley-Kat-Abra created by Feline Faust, a villain from Earth-C- Minus, later killed him and framed Yankee Poodle for the crime. *Johnny Jingo / The American Eagle: An eagle, who is \\"the radio talk show host with two right wings\\" by day, and a vigilante by night. Jingo replaced Little Cheese on the reconstituted Zoo Crew after the latter's death. He is the only member who does not have superpowers, though he does use gadgets similar to those used by the Batman. In the story in Teen Titans (vol. 3) #30-31, deceased Earth-C meta-animals named (other than Little Cheese) include Carrie Carrot, Giant Giraffe, Marvel Bunny Jr., Ballistic Baboon, Amazing Ant, and Power Panda. These heroes may or may not have been former Zoo Crew members. Villains Enemies of the Zoo Crew include: *Dr. Hoot: an owl who uses various scientific gadgets to commit crimes. *Amazoo: An android from Earth-C-Minus that is a funny animal counterpart of the DC Comics villain Amazo; it has the abilities of all animals on Earth C-Minus. *The Shaggy Dawg: A sheepdog from Earth-C- Minus that is a funny animal counterpart of the DC Comics villain the Shaggy Man. *A.C.R.O.S.T.I.C.: A Cabal Recently Organized Solely To Instigate Crimes (as well as other variants designed to fit that particular acrostic), a secretive organization that plots to overthrow the American government. *\\"Feathers\\" Fillmore / Brother Hood: A.C.R.O.S.T.I.C.'s shadowy leader, named for his black hood. He is President Mallard Fillmore's criminally adept brother. *Cold Turkey: A turkey with weather control and \\"cold ray\\" devices; he calls his hoodlums \\"Snowbirds\\". *Jailhouse Roc: A giant vulture who had been in jail since the late 1950s, until he is released to work for A.C.R.O.S.T.I.C. *Melvin McMole / Digger O'Doom: A mole who gains tremendous strength after eating one of Rodney's cosmic carrots. *Fennimore Frog / Frogzilla: Formerly a frog, he is turned into a giant frog by A.C.R.O.S.T.I.C. as a means of seeking revenge against his old foe, Dunbar Dodo. Both Fennimore and Dunbar originally appeared in DC's \\"funny animal\\" title The Dodo and the Frog. *Feline Faust: A cat sorcerer from Earth-C-Minus that is a funny animal counterpart of the DC Comics villain Felix Faust. His servitor, \\"Dark Alley\\", later killed Little Cheese and framed Yankee Poodle for the crime. *Gorilla Grodd: The brilliant, mind-controlling gorilla once transported himself to Earth-C, only to be defeated by the Zoo Crew and the Changeling.Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! #20 (November 1983) *Armordillo: A villainous armadillo from the \\"Lone Stork State\\" of Taxes with \\"nine-banded armor\\" and razor-sharp claws.Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! #2 (April 1982) *Kongaroo: A giant kangaroo from Aukstralia, who is transformed into a giant kangaroo by A.C.R.O.S.T.I.C. *Garrison Gorilla / King Kone: A disgruntled gorilla ex-employee of the Basset & Robins ice cream company who wears a refrigerated suit (√† la Mr. Freeze), equipped with a gun that projected destructive blasts of ice cream.Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! #18 (August 1983) *The Time-Keeper: A rotund bear who collects great moments from history, disrupting the normal flow of time on Earth-C. His time-control powers are considerable; he proves to be capable of aging or infantizing others at will, and transporting others through space and time. He attempts to pursue Alley-Kat Abra romantically.Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! #9 (November 1982) *The Salamandroid: A heat-based salamander android and a creation of Dr. Hoot; a member of the anti-mammal movement in The Final Ark. *Rash Al Paca: An alpaca and an Earth-26 analogue of Ra's al Ghul; he is working with the anti-mammal movement in The Final Ark to flood the world. *Starro the Conqueror: An alien starfish and an enemy of the Justice League of America. After a past battle between the JLA and Starro on Earth-One in the original DC Multiverse, a severed piece of Starro falls through a chartreuse hole and regenerates into a new Starro on Earth-C, although this version's motives and tactics are somewhat different from the original Starro. He was the Zoo Crew's first opponent, and most recently appeared in Captain Carrot and the Final Ark #1-3. *A. \\"Wolfie\\" Wolfe / The Wuz-Wolf: A wolf who was formerly Peter Porkchop's neighbor, Wolfe became the villainous character after acquiring a talisman that contained some of the steel that Peter had fallen into and given him his powers (thus containing some of the meteor fragment as well). He is Earth-C's version of a werewolf (depicted here as a human being, a mythical creature on Earth-C); in this case, having suffered from the compulsion to eat Peter in his youth (which he got psychiatric help for), Wolfe acted on this impulse as the Wuz-Wolf and was left disgusted after the Zoo Crew managed to cure him.Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! #10-11 (December 1982-January 1983) Other media *The Zoo Crew appeared in the Robot Chicken DC Comics Special in a skit in which the superheroes of Earth-One travel to Earth-C for the funeral of Captain Carrot. Green Lantern cannot keep from cracking up, however, because the natives of that dimension are all talking animals that look like cartoon characters. After Little Cheese comments on Green Lantern's insensitive behavior, Batman begins to snicker at his name. Pig-Iron and Rubberduck also made a brief cameo in the third DC Comics special. Rubberduck was voiced by \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic. *The Zoo Crew made an appearance in Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure.

Precanceled stamps are typically used by mass mailers, who can save the postal system time and effort by prearranging to use the precancels, and delivering the stamped mail ready for sorting. Precancels were also used on newspaper wrappers in Canada, Austria and Great Britain. The postal administration will typically offer an incentive in the form of a reduced price for precanceled stamps in volume. Precancels cannot normally be purchased by the general public, although they are often seen in one's daily mail. A number of nations of the world use precancels, typically in the form of an overprint on definitive series stamps. For instance, in France, the overprint is a semicircle reading AFFRANCHts. POSTES (Affranchissements Postes) The United Nations Postal Administration issued one, on Scott catalogue #2, 1 1/2-cent stamp first issued in 1951. Many towns and cities of Belgium and the United States have issued precancels printed with the community's name; in the case of the US, some 9,500 distinct examples of \\"bureau precancels\\" are known. Some types of precancels include a date as well. In the US, overprints have been gradually displaced by special-purpose stamps typically inscribed \\"bulk rate,\\" \\"presorted first-class,\\" or \\"presorted STD.\\" The Precancel Stamp Society, formed in 1922 from two previously-existing clubs, specializes in the study of precancels. A number of catalogs list all the types of precancels issued in the countries that use them. Postal training Around the early twentieth century, some U.S. business colleges used specially pre-cancelled stamps or stamp-like labels to train students in the handling of stamps.Carlton, R. Scott.

He was a member of the Liberal National Party of Queensland, and sat with the Liberal Party in federal parliament. On 1 March 2019 Ciobo announced his decision to retire from politics at the 2019 federal election. Ciobo served as the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment in the Turnbull Government from February 2016 until his resignation on 21 August 2018 in the wake of the Liberal Party leadership spill earlier that day.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-22/malcolm-turnbull-leadership-crisis- deepens/10149440 He went on to serve as Minister for Defence Industry, working in conjunction with the Defence Minister, until his resignation in March 2019. He previously served as Minister for International Development and the Pacific from September 2015 to February 2016, and earlier as a parliamentary secretary in the Abbott Government from September 2013 to September 2015 (initially to the Treasurer and later to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Trade and Investment). Early life and education Ciobo was born and raised in Mareeba, North Queensland, the youngest of three children in an Anglican family. His parents, Bruno and Joan, ran a tourism business in Cairns. Ciobo's father was born in Bari, Italy, while his paternal grandfather was born in Valona (Vlor√´), which at the time was part of Ottoman Albania. His maternal grandfather was born in London.Citizenship Register ‚Äì 45th Parliament Ciobo graduated in law and commerce from Bond University and earned a master's degree in law from the Queensland University of Technology. He worked at a food processing factory to help support himself while studying. While at university he reportedly considered joining Australia's domestic intelligence agency, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). Before entering parliament, Ciobo worked as a consultant with Coopers & Lybrand, as a senior consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers, and as an adviser to Senator Brett Mason.  Political career  Howard Government (2001‚Äì07) Ciobo was elected to parliament at the 2001 federal election, replacing the retiring Kathy Sullivan in the Division of Moncrieff. Ciobo has repeatedly called for the introduction of daylight saving for South East Queensland, despite this position being at odds of that of the Liberal National Party in the Queensland Parliament. In 2005, he urged the government to change the law to strip naturalised Australians of their citizenship if they incite, support or engage in terrorist activity. In 2006, Ciobo called for the first home owner grant to be doubled, a policy which was adopted by the Rudd government in October 2008 as an economic stimulus measure. In the lead up to the 2007 federal election, responding to a dare from a local radio station, Ciobo and his wife were thrown into the air on a sling shot bungee at the Surfers Paradise Adrenalin Park. While hurled up in the air, Ciobo's wife spotted one of her husband's stolen election signs on the balcony of a Surfers Paradise apartment. The radio station has since posted a video of the dare on YouTube.'Accelerate Your Candidate ‚Äì Steven Ciobo' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0gLwCLASsA Opposition (2007‚Äì13) After the Coalition lost the 2007 election, Ciobo was made Shadow Minister for Small Business, the Service Economy and Tourism in the Shadow Cabinet of Brendan Nelson. Nelson promoted him into the shadow ministry despite Ciobo publicly pledging his support for Nelson's opponent, Malcolm Turnbull, in the previous month's leadership ballot. Ciobo was critical of the merger of the Liberal and National parties in Queensland, telling ABC Local Radio in July 2008: \\"I don't believe it's going to have a positive effect on a federal level. But at a state level it certainly is going to make a very big difference.\\" When Turnbull replaced Nelson as leader in September 2008, Ciobo's portfolio was changed to Shadow Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors, Tourism and the Arts.'Coalition Shadow Ministry' In December 2009, Tony Abbott won a leadership ballot to replace Turnbull as Leader of the Opposition. He subsequently demoted Ciobo to the outer frontbench, as the Shadow Minister for Tourism and the Arts and the Shadow Minister for Youth and Sport. In September 2010, shortly after the 2010 federal election, Opposition Leader Tony Abbott removed Ciobo from the shadow ministry, relegating him to the backbench. Abbott refused to answer questions on the reason for Ciobo's demotion, other than to say: \\"There is something of the quality of snakes and ladders about the business of politics.\\" In an article in The Australian, contributing editor Peter van Onselen speculated the reasons for Ciobo's demotion were that \\"Abbott has never especially gotten along with Ciobo personally\\" and that Ciobo was \\"a Malcolm Turnbull lieutenant.\\" Van Onselen said the demotion reflected poorly on Abbott because Ciobo is \\"talented, a good media performer and part of the next generation in the Liberal Party.\\" In November 2009, Ciobo introduced his first private members bill as a shadow minister. The bill proposed changes to the government's producer offset to encourage more local feature film production. In November 2008, Ciobo attacked the Rudd Government over Peter Garrett's decision to axe funding for the Australian National Academy of Music, saying the decision was \\"the latest chapter in bungled Labor decisions that have ended one of Australia's centres of excellence and left students' futures in limbo\\". He also said Garrett's move to scrap the Uluru climb would be another setback to the tourism industry which had been hit hard by the global economic downturn. In April 2011, Ciobo called for a radical rethink of the tourism strategy for the Gold Coast, calling on the city to focus on more casinos and glitz. He said turning Surfers Paradise into a world-class entertainment precinct to rival Las Vegas and Macau was the solution to save the Gold Coast from rising unemployment and economic doom. In 2011 Ciobo and Labor MP Kelvin Thompson were seconded to the United Nations in New York City for 12 weeks. Ciobo was a prominent opponent of Andrew Wilkie's plan (initially adopted by the Gillard Government but later shelved) to require all poker machine players to set a daily betting limit. He told a Queensland newspaper the plan \\"will place the entire population that want to have a $10 flutter within arms' reach of big brother government.\\" In an opinion piece he wrote for ABC's The Drum in June 2011, Ciobo declared he was a libertarian who would \\"attempt to persuasively argue the need for less regulation.\\" In the article he said that \\"like the Tassie Tiger, personal responsibility has died out\\" and that \\"increasingly, I find myself thinking it is not this new law that is required, rather, it is a good dose of 'toughen up and stop blaming others for your bad decision'.\\" Abbott Government (2013‚Äì15) Ciobo addressing a Financial Services Council conference in Sydney in 2014. On 18 September 2013 Ciobo was appointed the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Joe Hockey. He was also appointed as Australia's alternate governor to the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Ciobo was given responsibility for the Foreign Investment Review Board, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Royal Australian Mint, the National Housing Supply Council and the Australian Valuation Office. Since his appointment, Ciobo has abolished both the National Housing Supply Council, saying the council's activities were \\"no longer needed\\"; and the Australian Valuation Office, saying \\"a compelling case for the Commonwealth providing its own valuation services no longer exists, particularly given there is a highly competitive market of private sector providers\\"; and announced plans to privatise the Royal Australian Mint. In December 2014, Ciobo was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to the Minister for Trade and Investment. Zaky Mallah incident In June 2015, Ciobo was part of an ABC Q&A; panel when he was asked a question from a member of the live audience. The questioner, Zaky Mallah, was the first to be charged under new anti-terrorism laws in 2003, and had been found not guilty after spending two years in a correctional facility pending trial. Mallah asked Ciobo a question that had been pre-approved by the ABC: \\"What would have happened if my [terrorism] case had been decided by the Minister and not the courts?\\" Ciobo responded that he understood Mallah's acquittal had been on a technicality, and he would be happy to see the government remove Mallah from Australia. Mallah later was given an opportunity to respond, and stated \\"The Liberals now have just justified to many Australian Muslims in the community tonight to leave and go to Syria and join ISIS because of ministers like him.\\" Moderator Tony Jones called these comments \\"totally out of order\\". Mallah later wrote, in Comment is free, that he \\"hates ISIS\\" and his comments were \\"misinterpreted\\". Following this incident, the ABC reported that it had received over 1,000 complaints about Zaky Mallah's presence in the audience,Tony Abbott declares 'heads should roll' at ABC over Q&A; 'betrayal'; abc.net.au; 25 June 2015 while Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott condemned the ABC - asking \\"which side is the ABC on?\\" and accusing it of having 'betrayed' Australia. Abbott subsequently banned front bench members of his government from appearing on Q&A;, demanding that the show be moved to another part of the ABC's editorial programming. When the ABC met Abbott's demands, accusations were made by an ABC 'source' that this was \\"the biggest example of editorial interference I've ever heard of\\". Turnbull Government (2015‚Äì2018) Ciobo in 2017 Ciobo reportedly supported Malcolm Turnbull in the 2015 leadership spill that saw Tony Abbott replaced as leader. He was subsequently made Minister for International Development and the Pacific ‚Äì a new position ‚Äì in the first Turnbull Ministry. Following the retirement of Andrew Robb in February 2016, he was promoted to Minister for Trade and Investment. His title was altered to Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment in July 2016. In early 2016, Ciobo publicly opposed Sydney's lock- out laws. Confronted with statistics of a 42.2% drop in assaults after Sydney instated lock-out laws, he responded \\"Well how does that sit with the way in which patronage is down? I heard someone quip, 'well there were 0 assaults in the Simpson desert too.'\\" Ciobo ran in the August 2018 Deputy Liberal Party leadership spill Minister for the Environment and Energy Josh Frydenberg won a majority in the first round with 46 votes, while Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Steven Ciobo received 20 and Minister for Health Greg Hunt received 16. On 1 March 2019 Ciobo announced his decision to retire from politics at the next federal election.  Personal life  Ciobo is married with two children and lives on the Gold Coast. In 2010, he told a newspaper his happiest moment was when his son, who was born with a heart condition, came through a five-and-a-half-hour operation well. His wife, Astra Ciobo, is a successful businesswoman who co-founded a Gold Coast public relations firm.

Champlevee enamel with Diapering: Barry of argent and azure, an orle of martlets gules William de Valence (died 18 May 1296), born Guillaume de Lusignan, was a French nobleman and knight who became important in English politics due to his relationship to King Henry III of England. He was heavily involved in the Second Barons' War, supporting the King and Prince Edward against the rebels led by Simon de Montfort. He took the name de Valence (\\"of Valence\\") after his birthplace, Valence, near Lusignan. He was the fourth son of Isabella of Angoul√™me, widow of John, King of England, and her second husband, Hugh X of Lusignan, Count of La Marche, and was thus a half-brother to Henry III, and uncle to Edward I. William was born in the , Couh√©-V√©rac, Vienne, Poitou-Charentes, near Lusignan,Cokayne, George Edward, Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom, extant, extinct, or dormant.

Move to England difference a label gules of five points each charged with three lions rampant argent The French conquest of Poitou in 1246 created great difficulties for William's family, and so he and his brothers, Guy de Lusignan and Aymer, accepted Henry III's invitation to come to England in 1247. The King found important positions for all of them; William was soon married to a great heiress, Joan de Munchensi or Munchensy (c. 1230after 20 September 1307), the only surviving child of Warin de Munchensi, lord of Swanscombe, and his first wife Joan Marshal, who was one of the five daughters of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke and Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembroke suo jure. As an eventual co-heiress of the Marshal estates, Joan de Munchensi's portion included the castle and lordship of Pembroke and the lordship erected earldom of Wexford in Ireland. The custody of Joan's property was entrusted to her husband, who apparently assumed the lordships of Pembroke and Wexford between 1250 and 1260. The Second Barons' War This favouritism to royal relatives was unpopular with many of the English nobility, a discontent which would culminate in the Second Barons' War. It did not take long for William to make enemies in England. From his new lands in South Wales, he tried to regain the palatine rights which had been attached to the Earldom of Pembroke, but his energies were not confined to this. The King heaped lands and honours upon him, and he was soon thoroughly hated as one of the most prominent of the rapacious foreigners. Moreover, some trouble in Wales led to a quarrel between him and Simon de Montfort, who was to become the figurehead for the rebels. He refused to comply with the provisions imposed on the King at Oxford in 1258, and took refuge in Wolvesey Castle at Winchester, where he was besieged and compelled to surrender and leave the country. However, in 1259 William and de Montfort were formally reconciled in Paris, and in 1261 Valence was again in England and once more enjoying the royal favour. He fought for Henry at the disastrous Battle of Lewes, and after the defeat again fled to France, while de Montfort ruled England. However, by 1265 he was back, landing in Pembrokeshire, and taking part in the Siege of Gloucester and the final royalist victory at Evesham. After the battle he was restored to his estates and accompanied Prince Edward, afterwards Edward I, to Palestine. Welsh wars and death From his base in Pembrokeshire he was a mainstay of the English campaigns against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and later Dafydd ap Gruffudd; in the war of 1282‚Äì3 that led to the conquest of Wales he negotiated the surrender of one of Dafydd's last remaining castles, Castell-y- Bere, with its custodian, Cynfrig ap Madog. He also went several times to France on public business and he was one of Edward's representatives in the famous suit over the succession to the crown of Scotland in 1291 and 1292.

He was the 37th mayor of San Francisco, California from January 1976 until his assassination in November 1978. He was known as \\"the people's mayor\\", who opened up City Hall and its commissions to reflect the diversity of San Francisco. Moscone served in the California State Senate from 1967 until becoming Mayor. In the Senate, he served as Majority Leader. Early life and education Moscone was born in the Italian-American enclave of San Francisco's Marina District, California.Sward, Susan (November 26, 1998). \\"Moscone's Time Was Anything But Quiet\\". San Francisco Chronicle. The Moscone family comes from Piedmont and Liguria.http://www.fontanarossa.net/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=131&Itemid;=152‚ü®=it His father was George Joseph Moscone, a prison guard at nearby San Quentin, and his mother, Lena, was a homemaker who later went to work to support herself and her son after she separated from her husband. Moscone attended St. Brigid's, and then St. Ignatius College Preparatory, where he was a noted debater and an all-city basketball star. He then attended College of the Pacific on a basketball scholarship and played basketball for the Tigers. Moscone then studied at University of California, Hastings College of the Law, where he received his law degree. He married Gina Bondanza, who he had known since she was in grade school, in 1954. The Moscones would go on to have four children.\\"Mayor, Supervisor Killed in San Francisco Shooting\\", Cornell Daily Sun, November 28, 1978. After serving in the United States Navy, Moscone started private practice in 1956. Career As a young man playing basketball and as a young lawyer, Moscone became close friends with John L. Burton, who would later become a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. John Burton's older brother, Phillip, a member of the California State Assembly, recruited Moscone to run for an Assembly seat in 1960 as a Democrat. Though he lost that race, Moscone would go on to win a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1963. On the Board, Moscone was known for his defense of the poor, racial minorities and small business owners, as well as supporting the first successful fight in San Francisco to block construction of a proposed freeway that would have cut through Golden Gate Park and several neighborhoods. California State Senator In 1966 Moscone ran for and won a seat in the California State Senate, representing the 10th District in San Francisco County.George R. Moscone, Candidate Election History. JoinCalifornia, Retrieved February 19, 2007. Moscone was quickly rising through the ranks of the California Democratic Party and became closely associated with a loose alliance of progressive politicians in San Francisco led by the Burton brothers. This alliance was known as the Burton Machine and included John Burton, Phillip Burton, and Assemblyman Willie Brown. Soon after his election to the State Senate, Moscone was elected by his party to serve as Majority Leader. He was reelected to the 10th District seat in 1970 and to the newly redistricted 6th District seat, representing parts of San Francisco and San Mateo Counties, in 1974. He successfully sponsored legislation to institute a school lunch program for California students, as well as a bill legalizing abortion that was signed into law by Governor Ronald Reagan. In 1974 Moscone briefly considered a run for governor of California, but dropped out after a short time in favor of California Secretary of State Jerry Brown. Moscone was considered ahead of his time as an early proponent of gay rights. In conjunction with his friend and ally in the Assembly, Willie Brown, Moscone managed to pass a bill repealing California's sodomy law. The repeal was signed into law by California Governor Jerry Brown. Mayor of San Francisco On December 19, 1974, Moscone announced he would run for Mayor of San Francisco in the 1975 race.Nolte, Carl (November 26, 2003). \\"CITY HALL SLAYINGS: 25 Years Later\\". San Francisco Chronicle. In a close race in November 1975, Moscone placed first with conservative city supervisor John Barbagelata second and supervisor Dianne Feinstein coming in third. Moscone and Barbagelata thus both advanced to the mandated runoff election in December where Moscone narrowly defeated the conservative supervisor by fewer than 5,000 votes. Liberals also won the city's other top executive offices that year as Joseph Freitas was elected District attorney and Richard Hongisto was re-elected to his office of Sheriff. Market Street Moscone ran a grassroots mayoral campaign which drew volunteers from organizations like Glide Methodist Memorial Church, Delancey Street (a rehabilitation center for ex-convicts) and the Peoples Temple which was initially known as a church preaching racial equality and social justice but turned into a fanatical cult.Taylor, Michael (November 12, 1998). \\"Jones Captivated S.F.'s Liberal Elite\\". San Francisco Chronicle. For the rest of his life, Barbagelata maintained that the Peoples Temple had committed massive election fraud on behalf of Moscone by bussing people in from out of town to vote multiple times under the names of deceased San Francisco residents.Cothran, George (November 18, 1998). \\"Barbagelata's Return?\\" San Francisco Weekly. The Peoples Temple also worked to get out the vote in precincts where Moscone received a 12 to 1 vote margin over Barbagelata. After Peoples Temple's work and votes by Temple members were instrumental in delivering a close victory for Moscone, Moscone appointed Temple leader Jim Jones as Chairman of the San Francisco Housing Commission. Moscone's first year as Mayor was spent preventing the San Francisco Giants professional baseball team from moving to Toronto and advocating a citywide ballot initiative in favor of district election to the Board of Supervisors. Moscone was the first mayor to appoint large numbers of women, gays and lesbians and racial minorities to city commissions and advisory boards. In 1977, he appointed Del Martin, the first openly gay woman and Kathleen Hardiman Arnold, now Kathleen Rand Reed, the first Black woman, as Commissioners on the San Francisco Commission on the Status of Women (SFCOSW). Moscone also appointed liberal Oakland Police Chief Charles Gain to head the San Francisco Police Department. Gain (and by extension Moscone) became highly unpopular among rank and file San Francisco police officers for proposing a settlement to a lawsuit brought by minorities claiming discriminatory recruiting practices by the police force. In April 1977 Moscone stood up to officials in Washington by supporting 25-day occupation of San Francisco's Federal Building by a group of over 100 people with disabilities demanding their civil rights in what would become known as the 504 Sit-In. While federal officials hoped to starve out the protesters, the mayor visited them and arranged to have portable showers and towels brought in. Thanks in part to Moscone's support, the occupation was successful, and helped pave the way for passing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) thirteen years later. In 1977 Moscone, Freitas and Hongisto all easily survived a recall election pushed by defeated Moscone opponent John Barbagelata and business interests. It was a political vindication for Moscone, who won in a landslide. Barbagelata announced he was retiring from politics. That year also marked the passage of the district election system by San Francisco voters. The city's first district elections for Board of Supervisors took place in November 1977. Among those elected were the city's first openly gay Supervisor, Harvey Milk, single mother and attorney Carol Ruth Silver, Chinese-American Gordon Lau and fireman and police officer Dan White. Milk, Silver, and Lau along with John Molinari and Robert Gonzales made up Moscone's allies on the Board, while Dan White, Dianne Feinstein, Quentin Kopp, Ella Hill Hutch, Lee Dolson, and Ron Pelosi formed a loosely organized coalition to oppose Moscone and his initiatives. Feinstein was elected President of the Board of Supervisors on a 6‚Äì5 vote, with Moscone's supporters backing Lau. It was generally believed that Feinstein, having twice lost election to the office of mayor, would support Kopp against Moscone in the 1979 election and retire rather than run for the Board again. Peoples Temple investigation In August 1977, after Housing Commission Chairman Jim Jones fled to Jonestown following media scrutiny alleging criminal wrongdoing, Moscone announced his office would not investigate Jones and the Peoples Temple. The later mass murder-suicide at Jonestown dominated national headlines at the time of Moscone's death. After the tragedy, Temple members revealed to The New York Times that the Temple arranged for \\"busloads\\" of members to be bussed in from Redwood Valley to San Francisco to vote in the election. A former Temple member stated that many of those members were not registered to vote in San Francisco, while another former member said \\"Jones swayed elections.\\" Prior to leaving San Francisco, Jones claimed to have bribed Moscone with sexual favors from female Temple members, including one who was underage; his son, Jim Jones, Jr., later remembered how Moscone frequented Temple parties \\"with a cocktail in his hand and doing some ass grabbing\\". Assassination Late in 1978, Dan White resigned from the Board of Supervisors. His resignation would allow Moscone to choose White's successor, which could tip the Board's balance of power in Moscone's favor. Recognizing this matter as such, those who supported a more conservative agenda and opposed integration of the police and fire departments talked White into changing his mind. White then requested that Moscone appoint him to his former seat. Moscone originally indicated a willingness to reconsider, but more liberal city leaders, including Supervisor Harvey Milk, lobbied him against the idea. Moscone ultimately decided not to appoint White. On November 27, 1978, three days after Moscone's 49th birthday, White went to San Francisco City Hall to meet with Moscone and make a final plea for appointment. White sneaked into City Hall through a basement window to avoid the metal detector at the main door. He carried his old police revolver. When Moscone agreed to talk with him in a private room, White pulled the gun out of his suit jacket and shot and killed Moscone. White then re-loaded his gun and walked across City Hall to Milk's office, where White shot and killed Milk as well. Dianne Feinstein, President of the Board of Supervisors, was sworn in as the city's new mayor and in the following years would emerge as one of California's most prominent politicians. Dan White later turned himself in at the police station where he was formerly an officer. The term \\"Twinkie defense\\" has its origins in the murder trial that followed. White was convicted of the lesser crime of manslaughter, due in part to his claim of severe depression, which White‚Äôs attorneys argued was evidenced by his consumption of Twinkies and other junk foods. Outrage over White's lenient sentence provoked a mass riot in San Francisco during which police cars were set on fire by angry protestors. White was released from prison and then shortly afterward committed suicide in 1985. Legacy Moscone's grave at Holy Cross Moscone is interred at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California alongside his mother Lena. Moscone Center, San Francisco's largest convention center and exhibition hall, and Moscone Recreation Center are named in his honor. Moscone and Milk also have schools named after them: George Moscone Elementary, Harvey Milk Elementary and Harvey Milk High School. Moscone's main political legacy is his opening up San Francisco City Hall to be a more diverse and inclusive place with political appointments that represented the full spectrum of the population, including minorities and the growing gay community. Despite a backlash from the political old guard and conservatives, and despite the double assassination of Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, both leading progressives, the city never retreated from Moscone's more inclusive view of politics. In 1980, sculptor Robert Arneson was commissioned to create a monument to Moscone to be installed in the new Moscone Convention Center. The bust portraying Moscone was done in Arneson's expressionistic style and was accepted by San Francisco's Art Commission. Arneson included as part of the decoration on the pedestal the likeness of a pistol that gained public disapproval. At issue were references to Harvey Milk, the assassinations, the \\"Twinkie Defense\\", the White Night riots, and Dianne Feinstein's mayoral succession. Arneson refused to make alterations to the work, the commission was returned to him, and it was later resold. In a critique of the event, Frederic Stout wrote that \\"Arneson's mistake was in presenting the city mothers/fathers with something honest, engaging and provoking, that is to say, a work of art. What they wanted, of course, was not a work of art at all. They wanted an object of ritual magic: the smiling head of a dead politician.\\" In 1994, a new bust by San Francisco artist Spero Anargyros was unveiled, depicting Moscone holding a pen, below which are words from Moscone: \\"San Francisco is an extraordinary city, because its people have learned to live together with one another, to respect each other, and to work with each other for the future of their community. That's the strength and beauty of this city ‚Äì it's the reason why the citizens who live here are the luckiest people in the world.\\" Moscone was portrayed by Victor Garber in Gus Van Sant's Harvey Milk biopic, Milk. Their murders were also the subject of the Dead Kennedys' version of the Sonny Curtis song \\"I Fought the Law\\". Moscone's son Jonathan, aged 14 at the time of his father's murder, later co- wrote the play Ghost Light with Tony Taccone about the effects the assassination had on him. It premiered at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2011. A public television documentary about Moscone's political career, Moscone: A Legacy of Change, debuted in November 2018, the 40th anniversary of Moscone's death. Produced by Nat Katzman, written by Stephen Talbot and narrated by Peter Coyote.

Plum Creek was spun off from Burlington Resources as a master limited partnership (MLP) on June 8, 1989. Burlington Resources was created from the Burlington Northern railroad's natural resources holdings in 1988. Plum Creek Timber is heir to some of the of timberland originally granted by the federal government to the Northern Pacific Railway in the 1860s, and most of Burlington's lands were originally purchased, or otherwise acquired as timberland. The MLP converted to a real estate investment trust on July 1, 1999 in order to obtain tax and accounting advantages available to real estate developers. Plum Creek Timber produces a line of softwood lumber products, including common and select boards, studs, edge-glued boards, and finger- jointed studs. These products are targeted to domestic lumber retailers, such as retail home centers, for use in repair and remodeling projects. These products are also sold to stocking distributors for use in home construction. The company also does mineral extraction, natural gas production, and deals with communication and transportation rights of way. As of December 31, 2014, the company owned and managed approximately of timber lands in 19 states, as well as owned and operated five wood product conversion facilities in the northwest U.S. On November 8, 2015, it was announced that Plum Creek would be bought by Seattle-based Weyerhaeuser for $8.4 billion, forming the largest private owner of timberland in the United States. The transaction closed on February 19, 2016.http://investor.weyerhaeuser.com/2016-02-19-Weyerhaeuser- completes-merger-with-Plum-Creek Transactions with the U.S. Federal Government In late 1999, Congress approved a land swap involving more than of forest land in the Cascade Mountains. In the deal, Plum Creek gave up of land, much of it along Interstate 90 east of Seattle, in exchange for in Federal lands. Plum Creek had warned the U.S. Government that it would log the land should the deal not go through. The federal government also had to pay $4.3 million as part of the deal. In 2008, Senator Max Baucus arranged for appropriations in the 2008 Farm Bill to be used to purchase of Plum Creek land in Montana. This project became known as the Montana Legacy Project. Environmental record There is some controversy over the management of Plum Creek's timberland, mostly from environmental groups who decry the recent move from Plum Creek as a timber management company into a developer of its land, taking advantage of the much more profitable land values that have occurred for undeveloped land in the late 1990s until the crash in real estate prices. Plum Creek is engaged in a proposal for a large resort and development tract in the Northern Maine Woods, on Moosehead Lake by Greenville, Maine, one of the largest undeveloped forests east of the Mississippi River. This follows on the heels of their development of managed land in Washington state (Suncadia) and Montana (Moonlight Basin, Yellowstone Club) into costly resorts, bringing golf courses and luxury housing into the deep forests. The debate pits conservation groups trying to balance recreation and protection, and the effects of sprawl and overdevelopment upon wildlife, quality of life, and the employment of local populations who depend in part on the hunting, fishing and tourist trades which may be damaged by the overdevelopment of the area. Plum Creek states that they follow three principles, Replanting, Protecting Water Quality, and Managing Wildlife Habitat. Every year Plum Creek replants approximately 85 million seedlings and plans for the natural regeneration of millions of trees. Close to of land owned by Plum Creek are a part of four habitat conservation plans across the country and in Montana are involved in a conservation agreement for the grizzly bear.http://www.plumcreek.com/Environment/tabid/68/Default.aspx In 2001, Plum Creek at their Medium Density Fiberboard facility completed the installation of a biofilter, a new air emission treatment technology. This technology uses naturally occurring bacteria to destroy air pollutants that are generated in the wood fiber drying and pressing processes. The technology does not burn natural gas like most treatment systems do to destroy pollutants.http://www.plumcreek.com/downloads/reports/2003EnvRepFinal.pdf They are also currently working on a Plum Creek Moosehead development.

The Philippines is known to have had the first hip hop music scene in AsiaMusic of the Philippines - Filipino Hip-Hop - Encyclopedia II Global Oneness since the early 1980s, largely due to the country's historical connections with the United States where hip hop originated. Rap music released in the Philippines has appeared in different languages or dialects such as Tagalog, Bicolano, Chavacano, Cebuano, Ilocano and English. In the Philippines, Francis Magalona and Andrew E. are among the most influential rappers in the country, being the first to release mainstream rap albums. Apl.de.ap of the Black Eyed Peas, Cassie Ventura and Chad Hugo of the Neptunes and N.E.R.D. are among the contemporary Filipino-American hip-hop artists. History Origins Hip hop music found its way to the Philippines back when the country was under American rule. The towns and barrios surrounding the numerous American military bases that were scattered throughout that country such as Clark Air Base in Angeles City and Subic Bay Naval Base in Olongapo were among the earliest to be exposed to the culture; as contact with African-American, Filipino-American and Latino servicemen resulted in some of the earliest exposure the locals had to the new musical genre. 1980s: Seeds of a movement In 1980, the earliest rap recording came from Dyords Javier's single \\"Na Onseng Delight\\", a parody of \\"Rapper's Delight\\" by the Sugarhill Gang, released under Wea Records. That same year, pioneer Vincent Dafalong released the album Okay Sa- rap, with singles \\"Ispraken-Delight\\" and \\"Mahiwagang Nunal\\". Groundbreaking hip hop films such as Wild Style (1982), Breakin' (1984) and Krush Groove (1985) were influences. In 1982, local breakdancing crews like the Angeles City-based Whooze Co. International, with members consisting primarily from Clark Air Base, The Eclipse (whose former members included Francis Magalona, Dance 10's Darwin Tuason and current Federation Sounds' Glenn \\"Kico\\" Lelay), Info-Clash Breakers and Ground Control (whose members included Rap Master Fordy, later to be known as Andrew E.), and Jay \\"Smooth\\" MC of Bass Rhyme Posse became mainstays in local parks and malls in and around the Metro Manila area such as the Glorietta Mall, which was an early hotspot for breakers. Several mobile DJ crews of the era included such names as the Rock All Parties Crew which emerged onto the scene only to produce future Pinoy rap pioneers such as Andrew E. and Norman B. 1990s: The golden age The genre soon entered the mainstream with Francis Magalona's debut album, Yo! (1990), which included the nationalistic hit \\"Mga Kababayan\\" (\\"My Countrymen\\"). Magalona became an instant superstar thereafter. More artists followed in Magalona's footsteps. The list includes Andrew E. who released his first single, \\"Humanap Ka ng Pangit\\" (\\"Look for Someone Ugly\\") in 1990 and Michael V. with the release of his first song \\"Maganda ang Piliin\\" (\\"Pick Someone Pretty\\") in 1991, a cover of Andrew E.'s \\"Humanap Ka ng Pangit\\". Known as the \\"golden age\\" of Pinoy hip hop, the 1990s marked the beginning of many rapid stylistic innovations beginning in 1991 with the establishment of the Disco Mix Club Philippines which was one of the earliest platforms for Philippine DJ mixing battles. Early innovators of the style included DJs Carlo Yalo, Noel Macanaya, Rod \\"DVS\\" Torres and Omar Lacap, among others. Following the path set forth by their Bass Rhyme predecessors, the tri-lingual rap group Rapasia released their self-titled debut record in 1991, garnering the hit \\"Hoy! Tsismosa\\". One of the earliest Filipino hip hop groups to embrace such an abstract format, the album's lyrical content often contained a mixture of various Philippine languages (including Tagalog and Chavacano) along with English.pinoyrap.com Rapasia's innovative style would later be built upon years later by other Pinoy rap groups such as Zamboanga's Ghost 13. Rapasia's members included Martin \\"Bronx\\" Magalona, brother of Pinoy rap entrepreneur Francis Magalona. The other two members are Filipino-American, Ronald Jamias a.k.a Ronski J and the Tausug-born Ben Mohammad a.k.a Brother BM. The group was initiated via an International Rap Competition sponsored by VIVA Records and was held at the Music Museum in Mandaluyong. Andrew E emceed the program. Mastaplann was also another group that did all their music in English. The group had three DJs and two MCs. The MCs were known as Type (Johnny Luna) and Tracer One (Butch Velez, brother of actor Vivian Velez). They released three albums that went multi- platinum. The group was formed in 1992 in the Philippines, with original group members Butch Velez a.k.a Tracer One, Johnny Luna a.k.a Type Slickk, Disco Mix Competition DJs Sonny Abad, Noel Macanaya a.k.a DJ MOD, Lopie Guzman a.k.a DJ Ouch (also of 89.1 DMZ-FM and RSL Sound & Lighting Company), and managed by Jesse Gonzales and DJ Gilby. Butch and Johnny were balikbayans from the San Fernando Valley near Los Angeles, Sonny a balikbayan from Hercules near the San Francisco Bay Area and Noel and Lopie native Filipinos. In 1992, Mastaplann was signed by Universal Records, where they released two records; their debut eponymous release in 1993, and in 1994, The Way of tha Plann. These albums eventually obtained platinum status. The pioneering Pinoy hip hop act Bass Rhyme Posse would release their self-titled debut album on VIVA Records in 1991 which spawned the cult hits \\"Let the Beat Flow\\", \\"Buhay Estudyante\\" (\\"Student Life\\") and \\"Juan T.\\", becoming the genre's first rap group to release a record. 1992 marked a turning point for Pinoy rap with the release of Francis M's influential second album, Rap Is Francis M, which is highly regarded as one of the greatest Pinoy rap albums ever. Ushering in a socially awoken wave not seen in the Philippine music industry since the heyday of Juan De La Cruz, Sampaguita and 1970s Pinoy rock, Magalona's tracks dissected the various cultural, social and political problems that plagued his country such as drug addiction in \\"Mga Praning\\" (\\"The Addicts\\"), political corruption and instability in \\"Halalan\\" (\\"Election\\") as well as the detrimental effects of a colonial mentality to Filipino culture in \\"Tayo'y Mga Pinoy\\" (\\"We Are Filipinos\\"). The record's complexity and socially sentient message quickly earned it its classic status and became the standard by which future albums of the genre were to be compared to. Magalona's enduring contributions to the genre would later be recognized in the All Music Guide to Hip-Hop: The Definitive Guide to Rap and Hip-Hop (2003) published by Backbeat Books;Amazon Online Reader: All Music Guide to Hip-Hop: The Definitive Guide to Rap and Hip-Hop as well as in the U.S.-based hip hop publication The Source (May 2004). Another Filipino hip hop artist who achieved prominence during the 1990s is the formerly Los Angeles-based DJ Andrew E (born Andrew Espiritu), whose tracks \\"Humanap Ka ng Pangit\\" (\\"Look for Someone Ugly\\") and \\"Makati Girl\\" (as done by Norman B. of Bass Rhyme Posse; the first Pinoy rap track recorded to contain beatboxing) became big hits in the Philippines, rivaling even Francis M's previously untouchable reign on top. Prior to landing a recording contract, the rapper had competed in various rap contests around the Philippines; the likes of which also produced Pinoy rap stars Michael V., Denmark and Martin \\"Bronx\\" Magalona. Andrew E's 1991 hit \\"Humanap Ka ng Pangit\\" was the first to spawn a plethora of response records from other rappers in the country, such as Michael V's \\"Maganda ang Piliin\\" (\\"Pick Someone Pretty\\"). The rapper's ability to combine unique storytelling with raunchy and humorous wordplay laced with catchy beats made Andrew the first of his kind in the genre. He then went on to release a movie titled Andrew Ford Medina: Huwag Kang Gamol in 1991 which was the first film in the Philippines to include a full-on freestyle battle on screen. By the mid-1990s, he had established his own record label, the controversial Dongalo Wreckords, as well as many successful rap groups, including Cebuano rappers The Anthill Mobb, Madd Poets and Bicolano rappers Salbakuta. The former, known for their complex and versatile lyrical ability, achieved fame with their debut album Ikatlong Mundo. In 1997, Andrew E produced and hosted the first Pinoy rap television show, Rap 13. 1994 saw the emergence of another rap group, headed by a female balikbayan from New York. The group called 4 East Flava consisted of three homegrown rapistas - Von \\"Mack\\" Padua (who was molded by Martin \\"The Bronxman\\" Magalona and now with the group Pinoy Republic), Bernard \\"P-Slick\\" Santiago, and Paul \\"Shorty\\" Navarro, two DJs (DJ Edge and DJ Mec), and Jug \\"Honeyluv\\" Ramos, hailing from New York who was known as \\"the rose among the thorns\\". They brought out the hit \\"Check the Hood\\" (used for a shoe commercial) which was misunderstood as a diss towards Mastaplann. The same year, going against the wave of radio-friendly rap tracks that dominated at the time, the group Death Threat, founded by rappers Beware and Genezide, released the first Filipino gangsta rap album which told tales of the daily lives and struggles impoverished Filipino youth faced growing up in the slums of Metro Manila's barrios titled Gusto Kong Bumaet (I Want to Be Good).Death Threat In 1997, the underground Pinoy rap group Pamilia Dimagiba released their album Broke-N- Unsigned on Tenement Records, marking the re-emergence of the conscious emcee in Pinoy rap. A coalition of sorts, Pamilia Dimagiba composed itself of several underground Pinoy rappers and crews such as 8th Messenger, Shadowblyde, Spoon, Murder-1 of Khan's Assassins, and Young Galaxy of Iron Triangle, among others. The raw seven-track, politically minded album was a breath of fresh air at the time, as Pinoy rap during the era had taken a more hardcore, gangster persona. Known for their coarse lyrics, serious subject matter complemented by heavy beats fused within traditional Filipino folk music, the camp's records \\"Duelo\\", \\"Manila's Finest\\", \\"Reality Hurtz\\" and \\"Brainstorming\\" among others were largely in essence a throwback to the early, nationalistic Francis M inspired days of the genre.pinoyrap.com The widespread popularity of Pinoy rap in and around the islands has resulted in the spawning of a new breed of Pinoy emcees: junior \\"rapistas\\". Far from being a new trend, Jaymie \\"Baby\\" Magtoto and her 1991 hit single \\"Eh! Kasi Bata\\" (\\"Cause I'm a Kid\\") was an early example of Pinoy kiddie rappers. The single was also included in the soundtrack for Magtoto's motion picture debut of the same name released later that year. The 2000s saw the resurgence of grade school rappers in Filipino hip hop. 2005 was a breakthrough for kid rappers in the Philippines as Aikee, through the Madd World/Circulo Pugantes Camp released his debut Ang Bawat Bata (Every Child) on Alpha Music and at eleven years of age, became the youngest Filipino rapper to release a full rap album. 2000s: The rise of Philippine hip hop scene In the new millennium, Filipino hip-hop rivalled Pinoy rock's traditional popularity amongst Filipino youth. Artists who are currently active and have released both rap albums and music videos in the Philippines since 1990 include Andrew E, Denmark, Beware, K-Ozz, Michael V. and Gloc-9. Other popular rap artists and groups of the 2000s included 2 High, 6 Signs, 7 Shots of Wisdom, 8th District, Anak ni Bakuko, Lawiboi, Apokalipsis, Artstrong, Akuma, Bass Rhyme Posse, BB Clan, Black Pro, Blanktape, Boom, Brownstyle, C-4, Candy Cousart, Chill, Chinese Mafia, Circulo Pugantes, Cris Asero, Cypha-Sis, Dagtang Lason, D.O.P.E.

In 2000, the golden-era rap group Mastaplann released a third album through BMG Records, under the new sub-label, Francis M's Red Egg Records, titled Mastaplann.com, a reference to their newly developed website. Additionally, the group scaled down their line- up to just Butch and Johnny, and then added Johnny Krush, another balikbayan from the San Francisco area. This album has already obtained gold status in the Philippines. Currently, the group is based in the States where they still perform and make music. Mastaplann is currently working on their fourth album, yet to be titled, to be released under True Asiatik Productionz. Since 2004, the Philippine Hip-Hop Music Awards has been held annually in Metro Manila. The show is reminiscent of The Source Awards in the US. Gloc-9, considered to be the fastest rapper in the Philippines and former member of the rap group Death Threat, held the title for Best Rap Artist at the awards show for four consecutive years, from 2005 to 2008, achieving mainstream popularity and releasing successful commercial albums every other year. Like the American hip hop industry, music videos have become an important trend (even containing small cameos from different Filipino rappers) and air on TV channels like MTV Philippines and MYX. Despite Metro Manila's powerful position over the music industry, rap groups in the south have started to gain their own share of popularity, like Dice & K9 a.k.a Mobbstarr from Cebu City with their first hit single \\"Itsumo\\" in 2003, Thavawenyoz from Davao City with their debut album Hubag in 2005, and Zambo Top Dogz from Zamboanga City, known for their Chavacano rapping in the songs \\"Noticias\\" and \\"Conversa Ta\\". It is also not uncommon for Filipino-American artists to perform live, sell records, and win awards in the Philippines while living in the States, for example Pikaso from San Francisco, California who won the Producer of the Year award in 2008.The 4th Philippine Hip-hop Awards Results - News Section - The Online Resource for Filipino Songs In 2002, Carlo Maniquiz and Nick Tuason, together with the assistance of FUBU's headquarters in New York City, established the FUBU Philippines clothing line, opening up several stores in the Philippines. In promotion of the new franchise, Francis M released a compilation album showcasing new local hip hop talent as well as two volumes of Tha Rappublic of the Philippines series, which featured young unsigned Filipino rap artists that were discovered through the nationwide talent search of the same name (including groups Crazy as Pinoy, Kamandag ng Marikina, and the Stick Figgas). Francis M would also go on to form his own clothing line in 2006 called Francis Magalona Clothing Company (FMCC) which are sold at his own branches of stores called Three Stars & a Sun.a Free Mind The F-Word was an album Francis M was rumored to be working on in 2008 to follow his last album from 2000, but leukemia and other health problems interfered later that year.TALK @ PhilMusic.com - The Online Home of the Pinoy Musician - Index The popularity of artists such as Dice & K9 a.k.a Mobbstarr (known for their popular Japanese and English combination hit song \\"Itsumo\\"), Pikaso, Audible,AUDIBLE Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's and Krook and J.O.L.O., who primarily use English lyrics in their tracks, has given way to the ongoing divide between Tagalog lyricists and English lyricists. With English tracks dominating the airwaves, several Tagalog-based emcees felt a sort of bias in the Philippine music industry, which favors artists who use English rather than Filipino. The conflict over language became evident in the 2004 Black Eyed Peas concert in Manila in which rapper Mike Swift's Tagalog-based track was cut short halfway through the song due to the \\"English Only\\" policy enforced by the event's organizers towards Black Eyed Peas' opening acts. Rap group Salbakuta, under Andrew E's Dongalo Wreckords, recorded the track \\"Ayoko ng Ganitong...\\", which contained lyrics partly attacking such \\"English Only\\" Pinoy rap artists. In 2006, the group Stick Figgas, runners-up in Francis M's Rappublic of the Philippines talent search, released their debut album Critical Condition under joint-release with Dice & K9's 6000 Goonz imprint and Francis M's Red Egg Records sub-label, which, amidst critical acclaim, sparked a resurgence and renaissance of sorts in Tagalog rap. The Stick Figgas relied on clever punchlines, creative lyricism and intricate rhyme schemes, re-introducing a technical poignancy that has been absent in Tagalog rap since B.B. Clan's first album Mabanges. This rap style has arguably inspired the current generation of Tagalog rappers to place much more emphasis on multi-syllable rhyme schemes, punchlines and metaphors than before. In 2009, after the death of Francis Magalona, independent rap labels and production emerged in the local rap scene such as Wika Records of D-Coy and PR Records and Entertainment (as owned by Von Padua of Pinoy Republic), Pikaso's Hustlin Records, Longevity Records and Turbulence Records, and Young JV's Doin' It Big Productions. Pinoy hip hop fashion has also emerged such as Pinoy Republic, Turf Clothing, Rapista Clothing, Boss Balita and Wika following Francis M's clothing line FMCC. 2010s: FlipTop battle league, trap genre emergence and second golden age The influence of the original rap battle leagues in the West ‚Äì Grind Time Now (U.S.), King of the Dot (Canada) and Don't Flop (UK) ‚Äì all founded in 2008, inspired the creation of other battle leagues around the world, FlipTop being one of them, in 2010. This local rap battle competition typically involves both parties (either 2 rappers or 2 duos) hailing mudslinging words and rhymes at each other, who are then judged at the end based on a number of factors including flow and use of insults/punchlines and audience impact. The one with the most votes from the judges is declared winner. Some popular artists who participate in FlipTop include Loonie, Smugglaz, Abra, Dello, Bassilyo, Batas and BLKD. Many other amateur rap battles arose such as Sunugan, Bolero Rap Battles, Bahay Katay, etc. The emcees also began to make and produce their own music. Famous battle emcees turned musicians from the early 2010s period include Abra, Shehyee, Loonie, Smugglaz and Bassilyo. Shehyee signed with Viva Records while Loonie and Bassilyo signed with Universal Records and MCA Music, respectively. However, Abra founded his own Artifice Records that would eventually become defunct. During the late 2000s up to the early 2010s, some Filipino rap artists began to concentrate and incorporate homosexuality issues into their songs. In 2009, indie rapper Dagtang Lason released a song called \\"Nagmahal Ako ng Bakla\\", a song about lads who prefer to love a gay because of their disappointment with girls. The song became popular among teens, Internet caf√©s and the jejemon culture at the time. In 2012, Gloc-9 released the song \\"Sirena\\", in which the music video features a gay person from his childhood to teenage years being abused by his father. Also in 2012, Abra released \\"Gayuma\\", which features a man who is in love with his partner, but it turns out the partner is a gay, which the man realizes later on after being given a potion. By 2015, several prominent trap and hip-hop recording artists emerged with notable hits including unknowns from the underground scene. The most popular artists which carries styles mixed with R&B; associated with trap beats influenced by Western hip-hop nowadays includes hip-hop collective Ex Battalion (whose hit \\"Hayaan Mo Sila\\" almost topped the now defunct Billboard Philippines Top 20 chart) and teen artists Shanti Dope (with hits including \\"Nadarang\\" and Mau\\"), kiyo, Angelo Acosta and Because. Rising star BJ Castillano (popularly known as Because) struck a deal with Viva Records after his track titled \\"Marlboro Black\\", first released on the platform SoundCloud became popular. Other names include Al James, Arvey, Skusta Clee and his own trap/hip-hop trio, O.C. Dawgs, with the track \\"Pauwi Nako\\" that became a nationwide hit in 2019. Filipino hip-hop acts also began to incorporate trending hip-hop sub-genres from the U.S. in their tracks such as lo-fi and trap soul. Significant projects of the time included Gatilyo (BLKD), The Lesser of Your Greater Friends (Calix), Manila Circle Jerk (Den Sy Ty), IKUGAN (Calix), as well as BLKD and Calix's collaborative effort (KOLATERAL). Hip-hop groups like ALLMO$T and Manila Grey (based in the U.S.) also made a huge influence and garnered tens of millions of streams from Filipino music listeners in 2019. Their tracks were used in social media challenges like the \\"Dalagang Pilipina Challenge\\" which uses the track \\"Dalaga\\" by ALLMO$T, one of the most streamed hip-hop tracks in 2019. Since 2017, the local hip-hop underground scene led by prominent hip-hop collectives such as Baryo Berde, 727 Clique, OWFUCK, 357 Pro (Rekta Sa Kalye) and Bawal Clan were established. Other elements of hip hop The art of MCing or rapping in Filipino hip hop is also represented in other forms such as battle rapping or freestyling. Several annual contests such as the F√™te de la Musique, the Blazin' Freestyle Battle and PR's Rap Mania are held annually within the Philippines specifically aimed at showcasing such talents, often drawing masses of undiscovered, amateur Pinoy \\"rapistas\\". Artists representing other elements include b-boy crews such as The Battle Krew (TBK), Funk Roots Crew, Soulstice Crew, Air Grounds Crew, Tru Asiatik Tribe (TAT) and The Balikbayan Tribe (BBT); \\"grapistas\\" such as Flip-1, Bonz, Ripe-1, Dope, Chas-1, Meow and Xzyle, and graffiti crews such as Samahan Batang Aerosol (SBA), Pinoy Bomber Crew (PBC), Pinoy Style Insight (PSI), Day Night Bombers (DNB), Katipunan Street Team (KST) and Crime In Style Crew (CIS), as well as beatboxers Christopher Oreo a.k.a BoomBuster and Cool MC Norman B (of the Bass Rhyme Posse). Beatbox Beatboxing is another element of hip-hop; Xam Penalba a.k.a The Bigg X represented the Philippines at the Beatbox World Championship in May 2015 at the Astra Kulturhaus Berline. He is a member of the Philippine Human Beatbox Alliance and beatbox group Microphone Mechanics with members G-Who, Leaf, Mouthfx and Abdhul. Filipino-American hip-hop Birth of a culture Filipino-American hip-hop culture bases its historical roots in the Filipino American, Latino American and African- American neighborhoods along the West Coast, specifically in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, and San Diego. The movement that had been born in the South Bronx among Jamaican, Puerto Rican and African-American youth in turn had its West Coast identity formed within the respective African-American, Filipino and Latino communities. Similar to the Filipino-American zoot suiters, be-boppers and ballroom dancers of previous generations, the dynamics within these respective communities would reincarnate itself once again in the form of hip hop.With Style: Filipino Americans and the Making of American Urban Culture by Victor Hugo Viesca Since the 1990 Census, Filipino Americans have made up the second largest Asian Pacific American group in the United States (after Chinese Americans),https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/censr-17.pdf and until 2000 were the largest Asian group in California. In West Coast hip hop, their role has been comparable to that of Puerto Rican artists on the East Coast, who were an integral part, along with African Americans, in the creation of the foundations of hip hop culture. As early as the late 1970s, during hip hop's infancy, pioneering mobile Bay Area Filipino mobile DJ crews such as Sound Explosion, Unlimited Sounds, Electric Sounds, Fusion, Ladda Sounds, 3-Style Attractions, Ultimate Creations, Sound Patrol, Soundsation, Sound City Productions, Kicks Company, Images, Non-Stop Boogie, Imperial Sounds, Unique Musique, Nite Life Sensations, Rok A Long and Sound Sequence among many others helped capitalize on the massive Filipino party scene by introducing the newly formed genre of music while spreading its popularity throughout South San Francisco and its surrounding areas through paid gigs in house/block parties, family gatherings, school pep rallies, weddings and church halls; primarily playing and mixing electro funk alongside Latin freestyle. Rival crews would often one-up each other by showcasing superior equipment and providing elaborate set-ups. Early mobile DJ stars included DJ Ren (born Rene Anies), founder of one of the first Filipino American DJ crews Electric Sounds, DJ Dynamix (born Dave Refuerzo) of Sound Patrol who established 3-Style Attractions, a widely known mobile DJ crew in the Bay Area, and DJ D-Styles (born Dave Cuasito), who in 1987 established the mobile DJ crew Sound City Productions. In 1983, a real-estate agent by the name of Mark Bradford established Imagine, which began primarily as a showcase for Filipino DJ talent in and around the Bay Area and came to serve as the premier event for DJs until the founders' murder in 1991. The movement would reach its pinnacle in 1987, when more than one hundred mobile DJ crews would participate in all- important DJ sound clashes and showcases. By the late 1980s, the \\"mobile DJ\\" movement had declined in popularity and had given way to the \\"turntablist\\", largely due to the rise of Q-Bert and the innovation of scratching within the DJ community. The legacy of the \\"mobile DJ\\" would live on however, because many of the Bay Area turntablists that would go on to define the art in the 1990s such as Q-Bert himself, along with DJ Shortkut, often had their beginnings in mobile DJ work.NOiSE Also in New York City, early hip hop musician and salsa legend Joe Bataan (half Filipino and half African American) had one of the first rap hits, \\"Rap-O Clap-O\\" in 1979, released on his Salsoul label.Joe Bataan Rap-O Clap-O (Brazilian 12\\") DiscoMusic.com In 1981, DJ Nasty Nes (of Rap Attack and NastyMix Records fame) of Seattle launched the specialty show Fresh Tracks on Seattle's 1250 KFOX introducing the first ever hip-hop radio station on the West Coast. He would later go on to serve as the DJ for pioneering Seattle rapper Sir Mix-A-Lot. In the 1980s, several legendary Filipino b-boy groups such as the Renegade Rockers, Knuckleneck Tribe, Rock Force Crew, Daly City Breakers, Jughead Tribe and Concrete Rockers also emerged from the Bay Area rivaling even the New York City-based Rock Steady Crew, whose official West Coast contingent is known to consist of several Filipino American members. Kalifornia Noize Terrorists' Paul Sirate, better known as P-Kid P-Kid (listed under the category B-boys/girls) is the same person as Pikaso (Mr. Sirate), listed under the category Producers emerged from the Bay Area becoming one of the early premier breakdancers and later went on to MCing and producing, lacing tracks for the likes of the Bronx's Terror Squad and L.A.'s Pharcyde. Elsewhere in the Bay Area, pioneering Filipina rapper Lani Luv (born Melanie Cagonot) became one of the early West Coast female MCs. Several tagging crews such as Oakland's Those Damn Kids (TDK) were some of the originators of \\"graf art\\" on the West Coast. It was during this time in 1983 that TDK's King Dream (born Michael Francisco) surfaced out of the graf art world. Francisco utilized his pieces to celebrate, express and educate from his own Filipino American background in order to promote tolerance while simultaneously strengthening bonds with others from differing cultures, eventually achieving international recognition. Now deceased (Dream was murdered in 2000), he is considered by many to have been one of the greatest and most influential graf writers whose work had been expressive of his urban environment while focusing on social issues concerning not only Filipino Americans, but also other people of color in America such as police brutality, racism, nationwide liberation and rebellion.The Dream Kontinues - www.dreamtdk.com Although generally associated with the West Coast with individuals and groups such as Blue Scholars and Native Guns, Filipino American hip hop is increasingly represented by emcees in other regions, from East Coast performers such as Q-York hailing from Queens, New York (currently residing in the Philippines) to Midwestern groups such as Chicago's The Pacifics. West Coast rapper/producer hailing from Los Angeles, Sevenes, is known for his track \\"Lakas\\" being the first Tagalog rap song to feature on an American TV show, on NCIS: Los Angeles. Maryland's Gagong Rapper crew gained fame in the early 2000s by flooding the Internet with their home-recordings and heading the underground sub-label Sandamukal Records. L.A.'s Grupo ni Berdugo and Sunog Baga, under F.O.B Entertainment, has recently been making names for themselves, the latter being signed by Andrew E's Dongalo Wreckordz and opening up for Gloc-9's L.A. show. Hailing from San Jose, California, Yung Rizzo of Fly High Music Group, has established himself as a hip hop artist from this region. Yung Rizzo's versatility and unique style of delivery has earned both national and international acclaim. Currently he is working on projects that include singles featuring mainstream artists the Jacka of the Mob Figaz and Mistah F.A.B., as well as his first studio album, Back of My Mind which is planned after the release of the EP, Mindset. Even further north of the American border in Canada, Filipino hip hop has established an active scene, with the likes of Montreal's New Elementz, Vancouver's conscious rap-tandem The On Point Collective,On Point Collective Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's the veteran emcee Jae Spillz, Filipino rapper ONE3D,ONE3D - Filipino Hip Hop ONE3DMusic.com and the hip hop power label Cashtown Records; home to a variety of artists including the underground Tagalog emcees Franchizze One and Lyrikal Abstrakt, or Dos Armados, who went on to form their own label subsidiary, Southeast Cartel.Southeast Cartel Rise of the turntablists By the 1990s, hip hop artists of Filipino descent (particularly turntablists like DJ Qbert, Mix Master Mike, and the Invisibl Skratch Piklz) achieved prominence and came to dominate the DJ art form of scratching, introducing the world to a more innovative style of scratching utilizing a wide variety of new techniques, including the playing of actual melodies,Invisibl Skratch Piklz: Biography : Rolling Stone as well as the inventions of the \\"crab scratch\\", \\"tweak scratch\\", \\"strobing\\", and furthering the development of \\"flare scratching\\". In 1996, the International Turntable Federation, which hosts the largest international turntablist competitions, was established by Alex Aquino. DJ Glaze of Long Beach's Foesum have together been staples in the West Coast gangster rap scene since the G-funk era of the 1990s. DJ Babu (born Chris Oroc) has gained notoriety for his work with the turtablism group Beat Junkies and the alternative hip hop act Dilated Peoples. Many other notable DJ champions from other countries around the world such as Canada, Australia, Japan and Germany have also been of Filipino descent.Davey D's Hip-Hop Corner: The New Source For The Hip-Hop Generation Other notable DJs include DJ Kuttin Kandi (the first woman to place in the US finals of the prestigious DMC USA competition in 1998), DJ Roli Rho (1999 East Coast regional DMC Champ/1999 & 2000 Vibe Music Seminar Champion of New York City's 5th Platoon), DJ Icy Ice of Los Angeles' KDAY 93.5 FM, DJ E-Man of Los Angeles' Power 106 FM, DJ Marlino a.k.a da5footafunk of San Diego's XHITZ-FM Z90.3, DJ Enferno (2003 US DMC Champ/2003 1st runner-up DMC World) and DJ Geometrix of the Trooperz Crew, both from the Washington DC area, and DJ Manila Ice (2007 DMC US finalist) and DJ Jester a.k.a the Filipino Fist, both from Texas. Another longtime contributor is music producer and Hawaii's first hip hop DJ champion Joseph Netherland, better known as DJ Elite of Elite Empire Entertainment, LLC. Two longtime staples for entertainment in Sacramento are DJ Eddie Edul and DJ Billy Lane. The \\"raptivists\\" Filipino American hip hop also infuses influences from the native Philippine literary art of balagtasan, or Filipino spoken word poetry; although most Filipino American rappers primarily use English or \\"Taglish\\" in their lyrics, as opposed to their Philippine- counterparts. In the millennium, underground rap groups such as Blue Scholars, Native Guns (now defunct) and Kontrast have utilized this method in their styles, producing pure hip hop while promoting community activism and social consciousness through their lyrics, earning the title of \\"raptivists\\". Some groups, like San Jose, California-based Sons of Rebellion, also unify several communities through their music as they represent the Filipino American, African American, and Muslim experience. (offline as of last access, see ) Lyrics from Sons of Rebellion have even been used as part of a nationwide high school curriculum, for the technology-based high school SiaTech, and tracks from former Native Guns member Kiwi's album Writes of Passage: Portraits of a Son Rising have also been used in a Filipino-American literature course taught at San Francisco State University. Many socially conscious and community minded Filipino emcees often perform benefit shows to help out the Filipino community locally and internationally. In February 2007, Filipino American emcees Kiwi, Kapatid X, Power Struggle, Praxis Roks, Blue Scholars, and Rhapsodistas joined forces with other Filipino American community artists to perform a 'Stop the Killings' benefit concert in San Francisco to help raise awareness about the political climate in the Philippines.Stop the Killings MP3 Downloads - Stop the Killings Music Downloads - Stop the Killings Music Videos - Stop the Killings Pictures - MP3.com The Stop the Killings event utilized the power of hip hop to expose the numerous killings of innocent people in the Philippines. Blue Scholars and Kiwi went on to do a subsequent Stop the Killings tour, with shows happening in several major cities across the nation. apl.de.ap (Allan Pineda Lindo) Perhaps one of the most successful mainstream Filipino-American rappers is the Black Eyed Peas' apl.de.ap, who has released songs such as \\"The Apl Song\\" (from Elephunk), \\"Bebot\\" (from Monkey Business), and \\"Mare\\" (from The E.N.D.) which not only contain Filipino (Tagalog) lyrics but also native Filipino musical elements. Pineda has also founded his own record label, the Los Angeles-based Jeepney Music, to help discover and promote Filipino hip-hop talent from both the United States and the Philippines. \\"The Apl Song\\" not only contains elements of Tagalog and Filipino elements, but the track itself according to video producer Christina DeHaven, represents Allan Pineda Lindo's view of the Philippines when he travels back for the first time since he was 14 years old. In the English verses of the song, Pineda describes aspects of Filipino life back home which is seen in the lyrics, \\"How would you feel if you had to catch your meal, Build a hut to live and to eat and chill in, Having to pump the water outta the ground?\\". The shifting between Tagalog and English can be interpreted as showing both languages as equal or in an equal hierarchical relationship to one another which is especially important having included another language other than English in an American pop song, even though English is one of the two official languages of the Philippines. Chad Hugo (producer) One of the most successful Filipino-American producers is Virginia Beach's Chad Hugo. One half of the popular music production duo the Neptunes, Hugo, with his production partner Pharrell, have laced chart-topping hits for the likes of Jay-Z, Nelly, Gwen Stefani and Snoop Dogg, among many others.Chad Hugo Photos - Chad Hugo News - Chad Hugo Information He has also collaborated with the Black Eyed Peas' apl.de.ap, making an appearance in apl's music video for \\"The Apl Song\\". Media Film The 2000 documentary film Beats, Rhymes and Resistance: Pilipinos and Hip Hop in Los Angeles (produced and directed by Lakandiwa de Leon, Dawn Mabalon and Jonathan Ramos) chronicles the development of hip hop culture among Filipino Americans in Southern California during the 1990s.Locus : Music, Mayhem and the Silver Screen Radio There were two FM stations in the Philippines that played all kinds of R&B;, hip hop and rap music. These are the now defunct radio stations Power 108 FM and Blazin' 105.9 FM, which were the stations that recognized the latest and the greatest of the hip hop genre. The former project known as 'Project: Hip hop' was founded in 2002 by three high school friends, namely DJ Caine, MC Satoshi and Quaizy Ileon. Former radio stations such as 89 DMZ are now online radio stations, streaming live on the Internet. In 2007, Wave 891 eliminated its pop jazz/easy listening format and switched to full hip hop and R&B; in order to retain the Pinoy hip hop scene.

Production commenced in 1965 and ceased in 1987. A total of 312 of all variants of these armored engineer vehicles were produced. Design Combat Engineer Vehicle, T118E1 Development and Production Prototype development began in the late 1940s at Ft. Belvoir, VA by the US Army Engineer Research & Development Laboratories in conjunction with Chrysler. These early T39 Demolition Tank prototypes were based on the M26 using several different modified turrets, demolition guns and heavy mortars. The T118 prototypes used the T95 hull beginning in 1960. Both prototypes went through extensive testing at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds through 1963 and final trials in 1964. The T118E1, with a modified M60A1 turret was then accepted into service as the M728 in 1965 and achieved operational capability in 1968.Tank Data, vol. 3. Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD: US Army Ordnance School, Jul 1968. The turrets for the M728 were manufactured at Chrysler Corp.'s Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant, Warren, Michigan. Final assembly and mating to the vehicle hulls was performed at Anniston Army Depot in Alabama.Hunnicutt 1984, pp. 439‚Äì443 Initial production of the M728 was from 1965 to 1972. Many of the M782A1s were former M60A2 Patton tanks converted to M728A1s from 1982 to 1987. All M728A1s were converted and assembled at the Anniston Army Depot under contract with General Dynamics Land Systems with a total of 312 of all variants produced. Vehicle Description The M728 is a full-tracked combat engineer vehicle designed to provide maximum ballistic protection for the crew and is a heavily armed derivative of the M60 series tank modified to provide a mobile and maneuverable weapon for combat support of ground troops and vehicles. The M728 vehicle is used for breaching, obstacle removal, and pioneering operations. Although the M728 consists of a tank hull and a short-barreled turret, it is not a tank and should not be routinely used against enemy tanks. It is an excellent heavy assault support vehicle when used as part of a combined engineer-infantry team. The CEV is issued two per Engineer Company in the Heavy Division, two per Engineer Company in Corps (Mechanized), three per Engineer Company in Armor/Infantry Separate Brigades and three per Engineer Company in the Armored Cavalry Regiment. The M728 CEV with a M9 Dozer Blade Assembly and the A-frame crane boom deployed It is usually equipped with either a hydraulically operated M9 Dozer Blade Assembly or a D7 Mine Plough. The M9 Dozer Blade Assembly is used for clearing the way, filling depressions, leveling ground and for other purposes. The D7 Mine Plough is a V-shaped plough that performs countermine activities by lifting buried mines and pushing them to the side as the vehicle moves forward. They are controlled by the driver. A winch and retractable A-frame crane are mounted on the turret for lifting, carrying and winching operations. The hull front contains the driver's compartment, controls and instruments. The hull rear contains the engine, transmission, fuel tanks, and related automotive components. The turret has positions for the commander, gunner, and loader. The vehicle is also equipped with a NBC protection system for the crew. It can produce a limited smokescreen by dumping raw diesel fuel into the exhaust system to visually obscure the area around the vehicle as well as provide a limited vehicle recovery capability. Weapon Systems The vehicle is armed with a 165mm M135 short-barreled demolition gun with 30 rounds of HEP (high explosive, plastic) ammunition. The M135 is a license- built copy of the 165 mm L9A1 gun that was used on the British Army's FV4003 Centurion Mk.5 AVRE (armoured vehicle Royal Engineers) tank. Depending on the usage, the gun can be depressed and elevated against targets up to an effective range of . The gun's primary purpose is for clearing defensive fixtures and obstacles, such as walls, fences, roadblocks and bunkers, or for destroying buildings and is generally not meant to be for use in anti- personnel or anti-tank warfare. The pushing and heaving effects caused by the HEP round's base detonating fuze and large amount of explosive can demolish barriers and knock down walls. One round creates a 1-foot (0.3 m) diameter hole in a 7-inch (178 mm) thick reinforced concrete wall. The round's effects against bunkers and field fortifications are dramatic, often crushing or smashing entire walls. The gun fires two types of fixed ammunition, the M123E1 HEP Round and the M623 Target Practice Round. The main gun has a coaxial 7.62√ó51mm NATO M240E1 machine gun, with 2,000 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition. In addition, a .50 caliber M85 machine gun is mounted in the commander's cupola; this has 600 rounds of ammunition. Service history United States It was first deployed in 1968 during the Vietnam War.Decker, Oscar C. \\"The Patton Tanks: The Cold War Learning Series.\\" Camp Colt to Desert Storm: The History of U.S. Armored Forces. Eds. George F. Hofmann, Donn A. Starry. USA: University Press of Kentucky, 1999 The M728 was used in fire support, base security, counter ambush fire, direct assault of fortified positions, and limited reconnaissance by fire. They were also deployed at this time to West Germany during the Cold War to support combat engineer operations and participated in annual REFORGER exercises until 1991. During mine clearing operations in Operation Desert Shield, the M1 MCRS was found to be cumbersome, heavy and hard to transport. In addition, since they were originally designed for the firmer soil conditions of Europe, its rollers were unsuitable for the softer soil of the desert. Instead of rolling, they often merely skidded, pushing soil in front of them until they bogged down.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/mcrs.htm A mine clearing rake was specially designed and fabricated for the CEV in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The full width rake allows the CEV to clear minefields in non-cohesive, granular soils such as sand. The Mine Clearing Rake is a V-shaped tined plough that performs countermine activities by lifting buried mines with its tines and pushing them to the side as the vehicle moves forward. Attached to any M728 CEV's D7 Mine Plow or M60 series tank via a M9 Dozer Blade Assembly. The Mine Clearing Rake also uses an aluminum skid shoe which protrudes from the front of the tines and allows the rake to maintain a consistent plowing depth. It clears a path measuring 180 inches wide, accommodating heavy tanks and other armored vehicles. Additional features are that it weighs 4000 pounds and is easily assembled and installed. M728A1s of 72nd Engineering Company, 24th Infantry Division, inspecting a mine-clearing rake, Operation Desert Storm 18-FEB-1991 They were active during the Desert Shield phase of the Gulf War in clearing suspected minefields, creating temporary defensive fighting positions and staging areas in the deserts near the Iraqi Saudi border. The M728A1s of the 24th Infantry Division and US XVIII Airborne Corps breached the openings for the \\"Left Hook\\" flanking of Iraqi forces during the Desert Storm phase of the war, but they were left behind once they began the pursuit and exploitation phase of the operation.Foss, Chris. Modern Tanks. Glasgow: HarperCollins Publishers, 1995 A CEV of the 6th Battalion, 6th Regiment, 1st Armored Division, fired 21 M123E1 rounds into the stubbornly defended town of Al Busayyah: \\"That totally destroyed all the resistance in the town,\\" according to the battalion commander. After the cease-fire, CEV guns were used to break up coke piles that had formed around approximately 20% of the burning oil wells in Kuwait. According to the US Army, the guns reduced the time to break up coke formation from as long as two days to 15 minutes. Commanders were unanimous in their opinion that the engineer force needs an M1 chassis based vehicle for heavy breaching and gap crossing equipment to fully support the M1 Abrams and M2 Bradley vehicles. 3 M728CEVs were temporally acquired for use by the United States Department of Justice's FBI and ATF SWAT teams in to conduct Operation Showtime during the 1993 Siege of Waco, Texas. They were provided to the ATF by Task Force Six of the Texas Army National Guard from Ft. Hood. They were used to destroy perimeter fences and structures and to crush the cars of people on the compound. A M60 Panther MCDV armored mine clearing vehicle prepares to lead a convoy down a road in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 16 May 1996. Note the M728 in the background. US Army M728A1s were deployed in support of the United Nations' Resolution, NATO led Implementation Force (IFOR) in December 1995. Their initial mission was to assist in protecting and demining the international airport at Sarajevo. By September their mission had expanded to include road clearance, bunker demolition and protecting humanitarian aid and assist relief delivery in the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as to help protect civilian refugees when required by the Red Cross.https://www.revolver.com/page/Bosnian-War Task Force Eagle assumed control of its area of responsibility during a ceremony with United Nations forces at Eagle Base in Tuzla on December 20th consisting of elements of the 1st Armored Division and its supporting elements from the U.S. V Corps and were joined by forces from twelve other nations. During the campaign in Bosnia, at least 3 M60 Panther MCDVs were used in conjunction with the M728. The Panther would lead the convoy followed by the M728. The Panther operator would control the vehicle from the M728 via a remote control system during road clearing operations. There was a Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) camera system attached to the front of the Panther so the remote-operator could see where the tank was going through a screen on the remote control unit. The radio control signal was received by a long antenna protruding from the engine deck. The M728 also provided a good secondary clearing action by use of its bulldozer blade as it followed the Panther. It would skim the trail cleared by the Panther pushing away debris and keeping the route clear for other following vehicles, also smoothing out the road surface and could be used for filling in craters left by any exploding mines or ordinance. The CEV was also useful for quickly recovering the Panther should it become stuck, and its crane allowed easy loading and unloading of the mine roller onto transport vehicles. The 1st Armored Division was relieved by the 1st Infantry Division and returned to Germany in November 1996. The M728 has been determined by the US Army to be inadequate to fully support the M1 Abrams and M2 Bradley vehicles, also cited were the rising costs to maintain and difficulty in acquiring parts for a low density piece of equipment and was retired from combat use with no clear replacement in 2000. In the late 1990s, the Army decided it could not afford to continue developing complicated, maintenance- heavy vehicles for this purpose. The M1 Grizzly Combat Mobility Vehicle (CMV) was canceled in 2001, and the prototype developed never went into full production.http://www.military-today.com/engineering/grizzly.htmM1Grizzly Combat Mobility Vehicle (CMV) The Marine Corps however persisted and funded its own development and testing of the M1150 Assault Breacher Vehicle. As of 2009 it is still used by the Army National Guard and US Army Reserve. In 2018 the US Army began to phase out the M728 from service with the Army Reserves and National Guard replacing them with the M1150 and is to be completely withdrawn from US service by 2024. Other Users The 8 M728s formerly in service with the Singapore Army were retired in 2016, having been replaced by the Leopard 2-based AEV 3 Kodiak armoured engineer vehicle (AEV).armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/ The Spanish Army began the Programa Coraza ‚Äì 2000 (Program Armor ‚Äì 2000) in March 1995. One of its goals was the development of a new combat engineer vehicle, the CZ-10/25E Alacran, based on the M60A1 hull and converted from former M60A3 Patton MBTs with upgrades to the engine. It has an external appearance similar to the M728 CEV, but without the 165mm demolition gun, being replaced by a special backhoe. It also has a frontmounted dozer blade and is armed with a machine gun. An initial batch of 38 vehicles have been produced in close liaison with Engineers at the Army Logistics Command. Portugal retired its M728CEVs in 2013. As of 2015 they continue in service with the armies of a few other countries including Morocco and Saudi Arabia.

Mines containing magnetic or other non-pressure-sensitive fuses may escape destruction from the blast overpressure, but will usually be uncovered and blown to the side out of the lane. Armored vehicles avoid mines by keeping the left track in the cleared centerline. Cleared lanes should also be proofed with plows or rollers when available.https://rdl.train.army.mil/catalog- ws/view/100.ATSC/D571FA47-2A5C-429E-A34F-1C4B8F90E840-1276598592484/miclic/webpages/overview.htm * M1 Mine Clearing Roller System (MCRS) (LIN M18157): The MCRS is installed on the front of the tank through a removable adapter, and provides the capability for neutralization of Anti-Tank (AT) land mines, which are buried or laid on the surface, in the track path of the vehicle.

Also that year, Davis married actor Patrick Page, with whom she appeared in Beauty and the Beast (making her married name Mindy Paige Page). Davis and Page's wedding was featured on the TLC series A Wedding Story. TLC dropped Davis in January 2005, to revamp the show with a host-less format.

Windsor was an independent member for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Tamworth from 1991 to 2001 ‚àí supporting the incumbent Greiner Liberal/National Coalition minority government at the 1991 election. He subsequently entered federal politics, serving as an independent member for the Australian House of Representatives seat of New England from 2001 until retiring in 2013 ‚àí supporting the incumbent Gillard Labor minority government at the 2010 election. At the 2016 election, Windsor unsuccessfully attempted to regain the seat of New England against Nationals incumbent Barnaby Joyce. Early life Tony Windsor was born in Quirindi, New South Wales. He was one of three sons raised by their mother after their father was killed in a farm accident when Windsor was eight years old. He was educated at Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School, Tamworth and the University of New England, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Economics. He was a farmer at Werris Creek before entering politics. New South Wales political career In the 1991 election, Windsor was first elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Member for Tamworth. Windsor had originally sought National Party preselection for this seat, but allegations in regards to a drink-driving incident arose on the day of his preselection, and the National Party endorsed another candidate. In spite of the allegations, Windsor won as an independent candidate and held the seat for ten years. Windsor was one of the four independents who held the balance of power after Nick Greiner's Liberal-National Coalition lost 10 seats, resulting in a hung parliament. His decision to support the incumbent Coalition government ensured a second term in government for Greiner. After an adverse ruling by the Independent Commission Against Corruption against Greiner for offering former minister Terry Metherell a patronage job, the Labor opposition tabled a motion of no confidence in the government. Windsor and the other three independents told Greiner that unless he resigned, they would withdraw their support from the government and support the no-confidence motion. Rather than face certain defeat in the House, Greiner resigned and was succeeded by John Fahey. Federal political career Windsor resigned from the state parliament in September 2001 in order to contest the federal seat of New England. In the federal election held later that year, he defeated one-term National incumbent Stuart St. Clair. Windsor took a large lead on the first count, and defeated St. Clair on Labor and other party preferences. Windsor's victory was considered a shock result, since the National Party and its predecessor, the Country Party, had held New England since 1922, usually without serious difficulty. In September 2004, in an interview with Tony Vermeer from The Sunday Telegraph, Windsor was the centre of controversy over an alleged breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Windsor claimed that he had been approached, in May 2004, by a figure associated with the National Party with the offer of a diplomatic position in exchange for retiring from politics. Windsor made the allegations during the course of the 2004 federal election campaign, some five months after the incident allegedly occurred. The Australian Electoral Commission referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). Windsor was comfortably re-elected in the October 2004 election, increasing his majority to 21 percent. A month later, speaking under parliamentary privilege, he said that National Party leader John Anderson and Senator Sandy Macdonald had made the offer through an intermediary, Tamworth businessman Greg McGuire. Windsor also claimed that the AFP had referred the matter to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for determination. Anderson, Macdonald, and McGuire denied the claims. The AFP investigated Windsor's claims and advised that the matter would not be prosecuted. Windsor was comfortably re-elected in 2007, increasing his majority to 24 per cent. 2010 federal election As one of the six crossbenchers elected to the House of Representatives at the 2010 election, Windsor was at the centre of negotiations to determine the government after both major parties failed to win a majority in their own right. Windsor, together with Rob Oakeshott and Bob Katter, initially resolved to form a bloc to assist negotiations with the major parties to form government. However, several days later, Windsor claimed it should not be assumed that the three rural independents would move together. In a press conference on 7 September 2010, Windsor revealed that he would support the incumbent Labor government during confidence motions and supply bills. Oakeshott also threw his support to the incumbent Labor government, handing Labor a second term. It had been assumed that Windsor would support the Coalition due to his past membership of the National Party but on this Windsor made an analogy of him being an ex-smoker: \\"I've never been in parliament as a National, I gave up smoking about the same time [and] I've rid myself of two cancers\\". Windsor is known as the architect of the bill which became an amendment to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) known as the water trigger. The new legislation forced the government through a process whereby actions by large coal mining developments, in particular coal seam gas, which may adversely affect groundwater in the area and thereby significantly affecting water resources, had to be assessed for environmental impact. 2013 federal election On 26 June 2013 Windsor announced that he would not be contesting the 2013 election; partly due to an undisclosed medical condition. 2016 federal election On 10 March 2016, Windsor announced his intention to contest his former seat of New England as an independent candidate at the 2016 election. Windsor faced incumbent Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and Leader of the National Party of Australia Barnaby Joyce at the 2016 election, who had won the seat upon Windsor's retirement at the previous election. Seat- level polling in the seat of New England found Joyce and Windsor neck and neck.Tony Windsor could beat Barnaby Joyce in New England seat, poll says: The Guardian 29 February 2016Barnaby Joyce claims 'underdog' status against Tony Windsor in fight to keep seat of New England: ABC 14 March 2016Deputy PM in danger of wipe-out: The Australian 14 March 2016 On election day, however, Windsor was convincingly defeated, taking 41 percent of the two-party vote. Joyce actually won a majority on the primary vote, enough to retain the seat without the need for preferences. Before his defeat at this election Windsor said, \\"You haven't seen the last of me\\" and was asked if he would stand again if he did not win he answered, \\"I wouldn't rule anything out.\\"\\"Right Old Barney - A hard fight but Joyce (and daughters) see off Windsor\\", Townsend, Samantha, Sunday Telegraph (Sydney, Australia) July 3, 2016 Political views In an interview published in The Sydney Morning Herald following the 2010 federal election, it was reported that Windsor supports a rent resources tax, deep cuts to carbon emissions, and improved services to rural and regional areas such as Labor's proposed National Broadband Network but wants to ensure the scheme is fully costed. The same article claimed that Windsor supports the Coalition's position on water, and the Greens position on a universal dental scheme. He has fought a long-standing battle protecting the interests of local landholders and farmers living on one of NSW's richest agricultural regions, the Liverpool Plains, due to the impact of mining on underlying groundwater. The region is rich in coal deposits and mining companies, such as BHP Billiton and Whitehaven Coal, have sought to acquire land. Greens have campaigned alongside Windsor, against mining companies. During the 2010 federal election campaign, it was revealed that Windsor had sold his family farm at Werris Creek to a wholly owned subsidiary of Whitehaven Coal, and then leased the property back. The reported sale was for more than A$4.5 million. The Australian subsequently claimed that Windsor yielded a return about three times greater than other farmers who sold their properties to the same company in the previous 18 months. Windsor was present at the February 2011 announcement by the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, on the proposed July 2012 introduction of a tax on carbon emissions, together with Greens senators Bob Brown and Christine Milne, the Minister for Climate Change, Greg Combet, and independent MP Rob Oakeshott. Windsor downplayed his presence at the announcement, stating, \\"Please don't construe from my presence here that I will be supporting anything.\\" He was later reported as stating that he would not accept increased transport fuel costs for country people. He subsequently announced that he was supporting Gillard's carbon policy, as a matter of principle, and stated: \\"This is about the history of people, most of whom haven't even been born yet. And if I'm sacked from politics because of that, well, I'll remove myself with a smile on my face.\\" Tony Windsor called for a referendum on same-sex marriage back in 2013, saying that the issue should be removed from the hands of politicians. He has also endorsed a referendum on the death penalty.https://www.smh.com.au/federal- politics/political-news/windsor-and-joyce-in-spat-over- rednecks-20130424-2iekb.htmlhttp://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/tony- windsor-former-mp-could-return-to-politics-and-barnaby-joyce-is-in-his- sights/news-story/6ef4a9f832cbb5db1a91cf5627ec9586 After politics Tony Windsor ‚Äì The Biography was published in 2014.Fitzgerald, Ross August 9, 2014 The Australian Retrieved 9 April 2015 References Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Independent members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives for New England Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:University of New England (Australia) alumni Category:People from Tamworth, New South Wales Category:Members of the Order of Australia Category:21st-century Australian politicians ","title":"Tony Windsor"},{"id":"559488","text":"William or Bill Boyd may refer to: * William Boyd, 3rd Earl of Kilmarnock (died 1717), Scottish nobleman * William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock (1704‚Äì1746), Scottish nobleman * William Boyd (minister) (died 1772), Irish Presbyterian minister * Bill Boyd (baseball) (1852‚Äì1912), Major league baseball player * William Boyd (educator) (1874-1962), Scottish educator * William Boyd (pathologist) (1885‚Äì1979), Scottish-Canadian professor and author * William \\"Stage\\" Boyd (1889‚Äì1935), American actor * William Boyd (actor) (1895‚Äì1972), American actor, better known as \\"Hopalong Cassidy\\" * William C.

The name originates from the Tamil words mi·∏∑agƒÅy ( 'chilli') or mi·∏∑agu ( 'pepper'), and ta·πá·πái (, 'water'). It is related to the dish rasam. History Mulligatawny was very popular in British India by the end of the 18th century, and by the 1800s it began to appear in cookbooks of the day; with each cook (or cookbook) featuring its own recipe. Recipes for mulligatawny varied greatly at that time and over the years (e.g., Maria Rundell's A New System of Domestic Cookery contained three versions), and later versions of the soup included British modifications that included meat (though the local Madras recipe on which it was based did not). Early references to it in English go back to 1784. In 1827, William Kitchiner wrote that it had become fashionable in Britain: By the mid 1800s, Wyvern, the pen-name of Arthur Robert Kenney-Herbert (1840‚Äì1916), wrote in his popular \\"Culinary Jottings\\" that \\"really well-made mulligatunny is ... a thing of the past.\\" He also noted that this simple recipe prepared by poorer natives of Madras as made by \\"Mootoosamy\\" was made by pounding: In popular culture It was one of the soups prepared by the Soup Nazi in the famous Seinfeld episode of the same name. It was featured in the Homestar Runner cartoon Experimental Film with music written by They Might Be Giants. http://www.hrwiki.org/wiki/Experimental_Film#Commentary_Transcript In Germany, it is referenced in the English-language sketch, Dinner for One, which has gained a broad tradition to be watched every New Years Eve, and as a result ‚ÄúMulligatawny Soup‚Äù (as it is called in the sketch) has ended up with wide name recognition inside of Germany.

In 2010, he retired from politics, and has since written several books and been a political commentator. Background Lindsay Tanner was born in the East Gippsland town of Orbost. He studied at the local state primary school before obtaining a scholarship to Gippsland Grammar School in Sale, where he graduated as dux in 1973. He graduated from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Laws with Honours and a Bachelor of Arts with Honours, and later a Master of Arts in History in 1981. While still at university, he co-wrote a book on environmental politics and worked as a casual layout and design artist. He was Editor of Farrago and a Member of the Melbourne University Law Review. Tanner began his career as an articled clerk and solicitor at Holding Redlich Lawyers in Melbourne. In 1985, he became an electorate assistant to Labor senator Barney Cooney. He was Assistant State Secretary of the Federated Clerks' Union from 1987, then State Secretary from 1988 until 1993. He has been married twice, and has one son and three daughters.From ABC profile at: http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/mp-profiles/melb.htm , accessed online 23-11-2008 Parliamentary career In March 1993 Tanner was elected to the Australian House of Representatives representing the Division of Melbourne, and served one term as a government backbencher during Paul Keating's final term as Prime Minister. The Liberal Party under John Howard won the March 1996 election, and Keating subsequently retired from politics. A major reshuffle by new leader Kim Beazley resulted in Tanner's promotion to the Shadow Ministry and appointment as Shadow Minister for Transport. He remained a member of the Shadow Ministry, despite numerous changes of leadership, continuously until the election of the Rudd Labor government in November 2007. In 1998, Tanner was moved to the portfolios of Finance and Consumer Affairs. In 1999, he wrote a book entitled Open Australia, which explored how information technology could be used to enhance social justice and economic equality; and he also wrote a number of articles on targeted, \\"micro\\" ways of addressing globalisation and the decline of large-scale manufacturing, in which he suggested there was little substance to the notion put forward by neoclassical economists of a \\"simulated free market\\" in East Asian economies that explains their \\"emergence\\" (see 1997 Asian Financial Crisis). Following the 2001 election, he became Shadow Minister for Communications. Tanner has been a prominent member of Labor's left faction and it was thought that he might contest the Labor leadership in 2002, when former leader Kim Beazley first challenged Simon Crean. In the second leadership spill in December 2003, Tanner supported Beazley, who lost the party-room ballot to Mark Latham. The following month, Latham appointed Tanner to the new portfolio of Community Relationships, in addition to his existing responsibilities. After the October 2004 federal election, Tanner was thought to be a candidate for the position of Shadow Treasurer, which had been vacated by Simon Crean. However, once it became clear that Latham did not intend to offer him this position, Tanner announced that he would not stand for a position in the new shadow ministry. He subsequently released a brief statement, stating that he had \\"no complaint about how Mark Latham has dealt with [him] personally\\", but adding that he had \\"serious reservations about the emerging Labor response to our latest election defeat.\\" In June 2005, Tanner was re-elected to the Opposition frontbench and was appointed Shadow Minister for Finance.

The 2007 election saw Tanner's seat of Melbourne face The Greens on the two-party-preferred vote, the first seat to do so at a federal election. Labor retained the seat on 54.7 percent of the two-party- preferred vote. After the successful election of the federal Labor Party, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd retained Tanner as Minister for Finance and Deregulation. The role had previously only been known as Minister for Finance and Administration. On 24 June 2010, during Julia Gillard's first question time as Prime Minister, Tanner announced his intention to not re-contest his seat at the next election, citing that he wanted to spend more time at home with his family and stressing he had already planned to do so before the change in leadership. His tenure as Member for Melbourne ceased on 19 July 2010 when the Parliament was dissolved prior to the 2010 federal election. He remained as Minister for Finance throughout the election campaign.ABC News Post-political career Tanner has been appointed as a Vice Chancellor's Fellow and Adjunct Professor at Victoria University, and a special adviser to financial firm Lazard Australia.ABC News (2010).

In some MahƒÅyƒÅna scriptures, notably the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra, ParinirvƒÅ·πáa is described as the realm of the eternal true Self of the Buddha. Nirvana after death In the Buddhist view, when ordinary people die and their physical bodies disintegrate, each person's unresolved karma passes on to a new birth; and thus the karmic inheritance is reborn in one of the six realms of samsara. However, when a person attains nirvana, they are liberated from karmic rebirth. When such a person dies, their physical body disintegrates and this is the end of the cycle of rebirth. Contemporary scholar Rupert Gethin explains: Parinirvana of Buddha Shakyamuni Buddha attaining Parinirvana ‚Äì Depicted in cave 26 of Ajanta Caves ‚Äì India Accounts of the purported events surrounding the Buddha's own parinirvƒÅ·πáa are found in a wide range of Buddhist canonical literature. In addition to the PƒÅli MahƒÅparinibbƒÅna sutta (DN 16) and its Sanskrit parallels, the topic is treated in the Sa·πÉyutta-nikƒÅya (SN 6.15) and the several Sanskrit parallels (T99 p253c-254c), the Sanskrit-based Ekottara-ƒÅgama (T125 p750c), and other early sutras preserved in Chinese, as well as in most of the Vinayas preserved in Chinese of the early Buddhist schools such as the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins and the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas. The historical event of the Buddha's parinirvƒÅ·πáa is also described in a number of later works, such as the Sanskrit Buddhacarita and the AvadƒÅna-≈õataka, and the PƒÅli MahƒÅva·πÉsa. According to Bareau, the oldest core components of all these accounts are just the account of the Buddha's parinirvƒÅ·πáa itself at Ku≈õinagara and the funerary rites following his death.Bareau, Andrƒó: La composition et les √©tapes de la formation progressive du Mahaparinirvanasutra ancien, Bulletin de l'√âcole fran√ßaise d'Extr√™me-Orient 66, 45‚Äì103, 1979 He deems all other extended details to be later additions with little historical value. Within the Mahaparinibbana Sutta (Pali) The parinirvana of the Buddha is described in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta. Because of its attention to detail, this Theravada sutta, though first committed to writing hundreds of years after his death, has been resorted to as the principal source of reference in most standard studies of the Buddha's life.Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies, Paul Williams, Published by Taylor & Francis, 2005. p. 190 Within the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa s≈´tra In contrast to these works which deal with the Buddha's parinirvƒÅ·πáa as a biographical event, the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa s≈´tra was written hundreds of years later.The Mahaparinibbana Sutta is pre- Ashokan; see Juliane Schober, Sacred biography in the Buddhist traditions of South and Southeast Asia. University of Hawaii Press, 1997, p. 171, while the Mahayana text dates to the second century CE or later: see Shimoda, Masahiro: A Study of the MahƒÅparinivƒÅ·πáas≈´tra ~ with a Focus on the Methodology of the Study of MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tras, Shunj≈´-sha (1997) pp. 446‚Äì448. The Nirvana Sutra does not give details of the historical event of the day of the parinirvƒÅ·πáa itself, except the Buddha's illness and Cunda's meal offering, nor any of the other preceding or subsequent incidents, instead using the event as merely a convenient springboard for the expression of standard Mahayana ideals such as the tathagata-garbha/buddha-dhatu doctrine, the eternality of the Buddha, and the soteriological fate of the icchantikas and so forth.\\"The Doctrine of Buddha-nature in the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra\\", by Ming-Wood Liu, in: Buddhism: YogƒÅcƒÅra, the epistemological tradition and TathƒÅgatagarbha. Paul Williams, Published by Taylor & Francis, 2005. p. 190 Location of Gautama Buddha's death and parinirvana It has been suggested by Waddell that the site of the death and parinirvana of Gautama Buddha was in the region of Rampurva: \\"I believe that Kusƒ´nagara, where the Buddha died may be ultimately found to the North of Bettiah, and in the line of the A≈õ≈çka pillars which lead hither from Patna (PƒÅ»õaliputra)\\"\\"A Tibetan Guide-book to the Lost Sites of the Buddha's Birth and Death\\", L.

In Mahayana literature Attendants to the Parinirvana, Gandhara, Victoria and Albert museum Miyajima, Japan According to the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra (also called the Nirvana Sutra), the Buddha taught that parinirvƒÅ·πáa is the realm of the Eternal, Bliss, the Self, and the Pure. Dr. Paul Williams states that it depicts the Buddha using the term \\"Self\\" in order to win over non-Buddhist ascetics.Paul Williams, MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.Taylor & Francis, 1989, p. 100. \\"... it refers to the Buddha using the term \\"Self\\" in order to win over non-Buddhist ascetics.\\" However, the Mahaparinirvana Sutra is a long and highly composite Mahayana scripture,Paul Williams, MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.Taylor & Francis, 1989, pp. 98, 99. and the part of the sutra upon which Williams is basing his statement is a portion of the Nirvana Sutra of secondary Central Asian provenance - other parts of the sutra were written in India.Williams quotes Ruegg \\"La Traitƒó du TathƒÅgatagarbha de Bu Ston Rin Chen Grub\\" pp. 113‚Äì144, where the reference for this passage is given as Taisho 0525a12-b02 of the Dharmak·π£ema translation. The entire Dharmak·π£ema translation is found at Taisho 0365c06-0603c26. The first 10 juan which scholars unanimously accept as Indic in origin occupies just Taisho 0365c06-0428b20, while the remaining portion from 428b24-0603c26 is deemed by all scholars to be of Central Asian origin. See MahƒÅyƒÅna-MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa MahƒÅ-s≈´tra, subsection \\"Transmission & Authenticity\\" for details of scholarly opinions of textual structure with references. Guang Xing speaks of how the Mahayanists of the Nirvana Sutra understand the mahaparinirvana to be the liberated Self of the eternal Buddha:Guang Xing, The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya, RoutledgeCurzon, Oxford, 2005, p. 89 Only in Mahaparinirvana is this True Self held to be fully discernible and accessible.Kosho Yamamoto, Mahayanism: A Critical Exposition of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, Karin Bunko, Tokyo, 1975, p. 62 Kosho Yamamoto cites a passage in which the Buddha admonishes his monks not to dwell inordinately on the idea of the non-Self but to meditate on the Self. Yamamoto writes:Kosho Yamamoto, Mahayanism: A Critical Exposition of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the Karinbunko, Tokyo, 1975, p. 75 Michael Zimmermann, in his study of the Tathagatagarbha Sutra, reveals that not only the Mahaparinirvana Sutra but also the Tathagatagarbha Sutra and the Lankavatara Sutra speak affirmatively of the Self.

Biography Boyd was born in Accra, Ghana, to Scottish parents, both from Fife, and has two younger sisters. His father Alexander, a doctor specialising in tropical medicine, and Boyd's mother, who was a teacher, moved to the then Gold Coast in 1950 to run the health clinic at the University of Ghana, Legon (formerly University College of the Gold Coast). In the early 1960s the family moved to western Nigeria, where Boyd's father held a similar position at the University of Ibadan. Boyd spent his early life in Ghana and Nigeria and, at the age of nine, went to a preparatory school and then to Gordonstoun school in Scotland, and, after that, to the University of Nice, France, followed by the University of Glasgow, where he gained an M.A.(hons) in English & Philosophy, and finally Jesus College, Oxford. His father died of a rare disease when Boyd was 26. Between 1980 and 1983 Boyd was a lecturer in English at St Hilda's College, Oxford, and it was while he was there that his first novel, A Good Man in Africa (1981), was published. He was also television critic for the New Statesman between 1981 and 1983. Boyd was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2005 for services to literature. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and an Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He has been presented with honorary Doctorates in Literature from the universities of St. Andrews, Stirling, Glasgow, and Dundee and is an honorary fellow of Jesus College, Oxford.\\"Emeritus Fellows\\", The Jesus College Record 2011, p. 21, Jesus College, Oxford. Retrieved 11 March 2018. Boyd is a member of the Chelsea Arts Club. Boyd is married. He met his wife Susan, a former editor and now a screenwriter, while they were both at Glasgow University. He has a house in Chelsea, London and a farmhouse and vineyard (with its own appellation Ch√¢teau Pecachard) in Bergerac in the Dordogne in south-west France. In August 2014 Boyd was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue. Work Novels Boyd was selected in 1983 as one of the 20 \\"Best of Young British Novelists\\" in a promotion run by Granta magazine and the Book Marketing Council. Boyd's novels include: A Good Man in Africa, a study of a disaster-prone British diplomat operating in West Africa, for which he won the Whitbread Book award and Somerset Maugham Award in 1981; An Ice-Cream War, set against the background of the World War I campaigns in colonial East Africa, which won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize for Fiction in 1982; Brazzaville Beach, published in 1991, which follows a scientist researching chimpanzee behaviour in Africa; and Any Human Heart, written in the form of the journals of a fictitious male 20th-century British writer, which won the Prix Jean Monnet de Litt√©rature Europ√©enne and was longlisted for the Booker Prize in 2002. Restless, the tale of a young woman who discovers that her mother had been recruited as a spy during World War II, was published in 2006 and won the Novel of the Year award in the 2006 Costa Book Awards. Boyd's novel Waiting for Sunrise was published in 2012. Following Solo in 2013, Sweet Caress was published in 2015, the fourth novel Boyd has written from a woman's viewpoint. His fifteenth novel, Love is Blind, was published in 2018. Solo, the James Bond novel In April 2012 Ian Fleming's estate announced that Boyd would write the next James Bond novel. The book, Solo, is set in 1969; it was published in the UK by Jonathan Cape in September 2013. Boyd used Bond creator Ian Fleming as a character in his novel Any Human Heart. Fleming recruits the book's protagonist, Logan Mountstuart, to British Naval Intelligence during World War Two. Short stories Several collections of short stories by Boyd have been published, including On the Yankee Station (1981), The Destiny of Nathalie 'X' (1995), Fascination (2004) and The Dreams of Bethany Mellmoth (2017). In his introduction to The Dream Lover (2008), Boyd says that he believes the short story form to have been key to his evolution as a writer. Screenplays As a screenwriter Boyd has written a number of feature film and television productions. The feature films include: Scoop (1987), adapted from the Evelyn Waugh novel; Stars and Bars (1988), adapted from Boyd's own novel; Mister Johnson (1990), based on the 1939 novel by Joyce Cary; Tune in Tomorrow (1990), based on the Mario Vargas Llosa novel Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter; A Good Man in Africa (1994), also adapted from his own novel; The Trench (1999) an independent war film which he also directed; Man to Man (2005), a historical drama which was nominated for a Golden Bear award at the Berlin International Film Festival; and Sword of Honour, based on the Sword of Honour trilogy of novels by Evelyn Waugh. He was one of a number of writers who worked on Chaplin (1992). His television screenwriting credits include: Good and Bad at Games (1983), adapted from Boyd's short story about English public school life; Dutch Girls (1985); Armadillo (2001), adapted from his own novel; A Waste of Shame (2005) about Shakespeare's composition of his sonnets; Any Human Heart (2010), adapted from Boyd's own novel into a Channel 4 series starring Jim Broadbent, which won the 2011 Best Drama Serial BAFTA award; and Restless (2012), also adapted from his own novel. Plays Boyd adapted two Anton Chekhov short stories ‚Äì \\"A Visit to Friends\\" and \\"My Life (The Story of a Provincial)\\" ‚Äì to create the play Longing. The play, directed by Nina Raine and performed at London's Hampstead Theatre, starred Jonathan Bailey, Tamsin Greig, Natasha Little, Eve Ponsonby, John Sessions and Catrin Stewart. Previews began on 28 February 2013; the press night was 7 March 2013. Boyd, who was theatre critic for the University of Glasgow in the 1970s and has many actor friends, refers to his ambition to write a play as finally getting \\"this monkey off my back\\". A further play by Boyd, The Argument, described as a Strindberg-like take on human dynamics, was performed at Hampstead Theatre Downstairs in March 2016. Both plays have been published. Non-fiction Protobiography, an autobiographical work by Boyd that recalls his early childhood, was published initially in 1998 by Bridgewater Press in a limited edition. A paperback edition was published in 2005 by Penguin Books. A collection of Boyd's journalism and other non-fiction writing was published in 2005 as Bamboo. Nat Tate hoax In 1998, Boyd published Nat Tate: An American Artist 1928‚Äì1960, which presents the paintings and tragic biography of a supposed New York-based 1950s abstract expressionist painter named Nat Tate, who actually never existed and was, along with his paintings, a creation of Boyd's. When the book was initially published, it was not revealed that it was a work of fiction, and some were duped by the hoax; it was launched at a lavish party, with excerpts read by David Bowie and Gore Vidal (who were in on the joke), and a number of prominent members of the art world claimed to remember the artist. It caused quite a stir once the truth was revealed. The name \\"Nat Tate\\" is derived from the names of the two leading British art galleries: the National Gallery and the Tate Gallery. Boyd, who also paints, made artwork under the pseudonym of Nat Tate and sent it to auction, where it raised funds for an art charity. Nat Tate also appears in Any Human Heart, also by Boyd, with a wry footnote to the 1998 book.

He was the first coach to win more than 100 games at four different NCAA Division I schools, Driesell led the programs of Davidson College, the University of Maryland, James Madison University, and Georgia State University. He earned a reputation as \\"the greatest program builder in the history of basketball.\\" At the time of his retirement in 2003, he was the fourth-winningest NCAA Division I men's basketball college coach, with 21 seasons of 20 or more wins, and 21 conference or conference tournament titles. Driesell played college basketball at Duke University. Early life Driesell was born on December 25, 1931 in Norfolk, Virginia to Frank Driesell, a jeweler who had emigrated from Germany.Basketball: A Biographical Dictionary, p. 119, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005, . In the fourth grade, Driesell received the nickname \\"Lefty\\" for his left handedness.Left Is All Right; Everything from staircases to scissors gives the advantage to the dextral. So in a world designed with the right hand in mind, why is it that so many lefties are great athletes?, Sports Illustrated, March 9, 2005. He attended Granby High School and quickly became a star on the basketball team. Driesell earned the city's most outstanding player trophy and All-State recognition while leading Granby to the Virginia State Basketball Championship. He was named tournament MVP, totaling 59 points in three games. After graduating high school in 1950 Driesell received a full scholarship to attend Duke University, where he played center on the basketball team under head coach Harold Bradley.Charles \\"Lefty\\" Driesell, Duke University, December 14, 2005. Driesell graduated with a bachelor's degree in education in 1954. Coaching career After college in 1954, Driesell took an office job with Ford Motor Company. Driesell also found time to renew his playing career by joining the Virginia semi-pro ranks, where he once scored 59 points in a single game and earned a tryout with the then Minneapolis Lakers (later Los Angeles Lakers) of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was also given a chance to enter the coaching profession when his prep alma mater offered him its junior varsity position for both football and basketball. After convincing his wife he could offset a significant pay cut by also selling World Book Encyclopedias part- time, he accepted the job and produced back-to-back unbeaten football teams and a city basketball champion in his first two years. Driesell was promoted to varsity basketball coach in 1957, going 15-5 before moving to traditional in-state basketball power Newport News High School. There he inherited a team in the midst of a winning streak that he would build to a still-standing state record 57 straight. That unbeaten team won the Virginia Group I State Championship, besting his old Granby squad with four of his former starters. His combined varsity record at the two schools was 97-15.Milestones in Driesell's Career, The Washington Post, October 30, 1986. Davidson Driesell served as the head coach at Davidson from 1960 to 1969. During his tenure his teams won three Southern Conference tournaments and five regular season championships,Lefty Driesell Coaching Record, Sports Reference, retrieved June 8, 2011. earning him the Southern Conference Sportswriters Association Coach of the Year award four years running from 1963 to 1966.Driesell Named SC Coach of the Year 4th Straight Time, Herald-Journal, March 17, 1966. An excellent recruiter at each of his collegiate coaching stops, Driesell landed Dick Snyder, a first round selection by the St. Louis Hawks.Paul McMullen, Maryland Basketball: Tales from Cole Field House, p. 50, JHU Press, 2002, . He cinched his wooing of college prospect Don Davidson by telling him \\"I'll put your name on the front [of your jersey]\\". When legendary NC State head coach Everett Case attempted to lure Driesell with an assistant position offer Lefty replied, \\"Coach, I got a better team than you got. Why would I do that?\\" Maryland Driesell was hired by the University of Maryland at College Park in 1969. During his introductory press conference on March 19, 1969, he famously and boldly stated that Maryland \\"has the potential to be the UCLA of the East Coast or I wouldn‚Äôt be here,\\" referring to the nation's dominant college basketball program in the middle of a still unrivaled dynasty.Steinberg, Dan. \\"Lefty Driesell on the origins of 'UCLA of the East,'\\" The Washington Post, Friday, April 19, 2013. (Also includes a photograph of William Gildea's written account of the introductory press conference from the newspaper's Thursday, March 20, 1969 issue.) Retrieved January 28, 2020 While Driesell fell short of that overreaching goal, he was successful in leading the Terrapins to eight NCAA Tournament appearances, a National Invitation Tournament (NIT) championship, two Atlantic Coast Conference regular season championships, and one Atlantic Coast Conference tournament championship. Maryland was ranked as high as No. 2 in the Associated Press rankings for four consecutive seasons from 1972 to 1976., and produced a number of All-Americans, including the Number 2 pick in the 1986 NBA draft, Len Bias. Driesell gives his trademark \\"V-sign\\" during his first season at Maryland. Driesell coached the Maryland Terrapins from 1969 to 1986. In 1974, he signed a can't miss prospect sure to dominate college basketball, 6' 10\\" center Moses Malone. Instead, Malone opted to join the ABA Utah Stars, becoming the first modern era player to proceed directly from high school into professional basketball;Goldstein, Richard, \\"Moses Malone, 76ers' 'Chairman of the Boards,' Dies at 60\\", New York Times, September 13, 2015. Retrieved September 14, 2025. by the time he retired, he'd become a 16-time ABA and NBA All-Star, three-time NBA MVP, and Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer. Among other top names during Driesell's Maryland tenure are NBA stars Tom McMillen, Len Elmore, John Lucas, Albert King, Buck Williams and Len Bias. Bias was regarded by many at the time of his draft by the Boston Celtics as potentially as great or greater than fellow ACC legend at rival University of North Carolina Michael Jordan, then emerging as an NBA sensation. He died tragically soon after the night of his selection. At Maryland, Driesell began the now nationwide tradition of Midnight Madness. According to longstanding NCAA rules, college basketball teams were not permitted to begin practices until October 15. Driesell traditionally began the first practice with a requirement that his players run one mile in six minutes, but found that the players were too fatigued to practice effectively immediately afterwards. At 12:03 a.m. on October 15, 1971, Driesell held a one-mile run at the track around Byrd Stadium, where a crowd of 1,000 fans had gathered after learning of the unorthodox practice session. The event soon became a tradition to build excitement for the basketball team's upcoming season.He made midnight a time for madness; The college basketball tradition that resumes tonight began in 1971 with Maryland's Lefty Driesell, St. Petersburg Times, October 13, 2006. Midnight Madness has been adopted by many national programs such as UNC, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan State and Duke. In 1972, Maryland defeated Niagara, 100-69 to secure the NIT championship. Driesell said that the season attained the three goals he had set for the program at the time of his hiring: \\"national prominence\\", \\"national ranking\\", and \\"a national championship\\".Terps attain two of their three goals set by coach Driesell, The Free Lance-Star, March 27, 1972. On July 12, 1973, Driesell saved the lives of at least ten children from several burning buildings. He and two other men were surf fishing around midnight in Bethany Beach, Delaware when he saw flames coming from a seashore resort. Driesell broke down a door and rescued several children from the fire that eventually destroyed four townhouses. An eyewitness, Prince George's County circuit court Judge Samuel Meloy, said, \\"Let's face it, Driesell was a hero. There were no injuries and it was a miracle because firemen didn't come for at least 30 minutes.\\"Driesell lauded for heroism, The Baltimore Sun, December 28, 1973. Driesell said, \\"Don't build me up as any kind of hero. All we did was try to get the kids out. It was just lucky that we were fishing right in front of the houses.\\"Driesell To The Rescue, The Milwaukee Journal, July 21, 1973. For these actions, Driesell was awarded the NCAA Award of Valor.NCAA Award of Valor Recipients, National Collegiate Athletic Association, retrieved June 4, 2011. In the 1974 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament, Maryland was defeated by North Carolina State University in overtime 103-100, eliminating it from participating in that season's NCAA basketball tournament. Many consider it to be one of the greatest college basketball games of all time. NC State eventually went on to win the 1974 National Championship, with Maryland finishing No. 4 in the final Associated Press poll. One great team knocking the other out of the NCAA Tournament prompted its officials to make a landmark decision the next year, expanding its field from 23 to 32 teams, thereby potentially opening the door for more than one team from a conference. Today, that field has been enlarged to 68 teams. In 1984, Driesell led the team to the school's second ACC Tournament Championship.Driesell Keeps Perspective, Star-News, March 10, 1984. In December 1985, the university gave Driesell a ten-year contract extension. Earlier that same year, Driesell was made an Honorary M Club member. On June 19, 1986, Terrapin star Bias died of a cocaine-induced heart attack. A subsequent investigation revealed that Bias had exhausted all his athletic eligibility yet was still 21 credits short of a degree. On October 29, Driesell resigned as head coach and took a position as an assistant athletic director. He also worked as a television analyst during college basketball games. Some members of the media widely described Driesell as a scapegoat of chancellor John B. Slaughter and the university administration.Lefty is a scapegoat, The Robesonian, November 6, 1986.SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; Driesell Reflects, The New York Times, June 8, 1987.What Did Driesell Do Wrong?, Schenectady Gazette, November 7, 1986.Take goat horns off Lefty, Gainesville Sun, June 16, 1987.

His teams captured five Colonial Athletic Association regular season championships, one tournament championship, and an appearance in the NCAA Tournament.

The firm's lawyers come from some 80 countries, speak more than 60 languages and practice US, English, EU, French, Spanish, German, Hong Kong, OHADA and Saudi law, as well as Dubai International Financial Centre law and Abu Dhabi Global Market law. Nearly one-half of the firm's lawyers practice outside the United States. History Wall Street origins Shearman & Sterling was founded in New York City in 1873 by Thomas Shearman () and John William Sterling, who concentrated on litigation and transactional matters respectively. The young firm represented financier Jay Gould and industrialist Henry Ford, and cultivated a number of important business ties that would evolve into long-standing client relationships, such as with the Rockefeller family and the predecessor banks to Citigroup and Deutsche Bank. Postwar global expansion The firm expanded internationally during the post-World War II era, under the direction of Boykin C. Wright, a senior partner who joined the firm from Cahill Gordon & Reindel with a group of lawyers, briefly leading the firm to add his name to the letterhead. The firm's first international office was established in Paris in 1963. The Landmark's Gloucester Tower Bolstering the firm's reputation in international law, President Eisenhower tapped partner Fredrick McCurdy Eaton to be the United States' lead negotiator at the 1960 Nuclear Ten Nation Committee on Disarmament,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/05/obituaries/fredrick-eaton-a- lawyer-is-dead.html in Geneva. From 1964 to 1975, Mr. Eaton was the senior partner. In postwar Germany, Shearman & Sterling helped German companies such as Siemens and BASF restructure their debts and re-emerge as credible exporters to the United States. The firm's lawyers assisted Daimler in its listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1993, the first such listing by a German company, prompting other major companies to follow suit.Miriam Wildman, 'Daimler's NYSE Listing Piques German Interest,' New York Times November 19, 1994. The firm then represented the German automaker in its purchase and subsequent sale of Chrysler. The company practices mergers and acquisitions in Germany, and operates one of the largest London offices of a non-UK law firm.Berris, Julia (2007) The Lawyer, \\"Shearman & Sterling: Empire State.\\" The firm played an important role in the establishment of state-owned oil and gas companies, including Sonatrach in Algeria and throughout the Middle East. In 1979, Shearman & Sterling lawyers represented Citibank during the intense negotiations that ensued during the Iranian Hostage Crisis, after the US government froze all Iranian assets in US banks.Bruce van Voorst et al., 'Iran Hostages: How the Bankers Did it,' Time Magazine, February 2, 1981. During the 1980s, firm attorneys helped restructure the debts of many Latin American nations in the Brady transactions, and also won mandates in the privatization of numerous state-owned entities. In 2004, the firm launched an office in S√£o Paulo, Brazil and has since represented Brazilian companies in a number of important transactions. In East Asia, Shearman & Sterling was one of the first firms to grasp the future strategic importance of the Asia-Pacific region, establishing offices in Hong Kong in 1978, followed by Tokyo, Beijing, Singapore and Shanghai. In late 2018, the firm received a license to open an office in Seoul, headed by Singapore partner Anna Chung.  21st century domestic expansion  Domestically, Shearman & Sterling opened up an office in Austin in the first half of 2018 and another office in Houston just two months later.New York City office at alt=  Notable clients and cases  * CVS Health Corp. in its $69 billion acquisition of health insurance company Aetna * Electronic Arts Inc. in connection with a $1 billion investment grade senior notes public offering * WebMD Health Corporation in its $2.8 billion sale to Internet Brands, a portfolio company of KKR * Salesforce.com in its $2.8 billion acquisition of cloud-based e-commerce platform Demandware, Inc. * The Republic of Lithuania as Respondent in an ICSID arbitration brought by Veolia Environnement S.A. * The Dow Chemical Company in its $4.6 billion split off of the Dow Chlorine Products Business and the related debt-for-debt exchange * Credit Suisse in class action lawsuits alleging price fixing of the ‚Äúspreads‚Äù for initial public offerings * General Electric in its $32 billion acquisition of Baker Hughes Inc. and combination with GE Oil & Gas to form a new publicly traded company * JP Morgan Chase & Co. as lead arranger for ‚Ç¨5.45 billion financings for Pirelli * Qatar Investment Authority in its investment in Manhattan West, a development site valued upon completion at up to $8.6 billion * Sony, as part of a consortium, in the $4.5 billion acquisition of Nortel‚Äôs patents portfolio * Boston Scientific Corporation in the $1.5 billion sale of its Neurovascular Business to Stryker Corporation * Bank of America in connection with a $3.1 billion sale and repurchase agreement financing transaction related to Amgen Inc.‚Äôs $10.5 billion purchase of Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. * Deere & Company on the restructuring of its foreign operations * David Karp, the founder and CEO of tumblr, with his employment, retention and tax arrangements in tumblr's $1.1 billion sale to Yahoo! * Synthes, Inc. in its $21.3 billion acquisition by Johnson & Johnson  Controversies  Among Shearman & Sterling's East Asian clients is the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB, which had wired $368 million from a Swiss bank to the firm's trust account to pay for, among other things, a Beverly Hills hotel, private plane and yacht rentals, and the production of the film The Wolf of Wall Street.

The organisation is directed by Dr. Colin Rubenstein, who was previously a political science lecturer at Monash University. AIJAC has office locations in Melbourne and Sydney. AIJAC is formally associated with the American Jewish Committee. History Origins The Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council (AIJAC) was founded in 1997 through the merger of two earlier Jewish organizations: Australia-Israel Publications (AIP) and the Australian Institute of Jewish Affairs (AIJA). The Melbourne-based Australia- Israel Publications had been founded in 1974 by Robert (\\"Bob\\") Zablud and Isador Magid to present pro-Israel perspectives in the media and political debate through its monthly journal, the Australia-Israel Review. AIP had been established by the Zionist Federation of Australia (ZFA) and the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the two peak representative bodies of the Australian Jewish community, to educate the Australian public about the Middle East in response to growing public criticism of Israel. Under the leadership of Magid and later Mark Leibler, AIP became the best resourced Australian Jewish organisation. During the 1980s, the organisation expanded with the establishment of full-time southern and northern directors in 1982 and of a director of public affairs in 1987. The second organization, AIJA, had been founded in 1984 by the Melbourne businessmen Isi Leibler, Richard Pratt, and Mark Besen. AIJA's purpose was to conduct and encourage research into issues of concern for the Australian Jewish community. AIJA's activities have also included organizing several key conferences relating to anti-Semitism, Jewish education and the National Outlook Conferences, as well as producing research studies on various topics. In 1984, AIJA organized an international conference on anti-Semitism that hosted several prominent guests including Australian Chief Rabbi Sir Immanuel Jakobovits, Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League, Special Counsel to the United States Ambassador to the United Nations Allan Gerson, Israeli academics Itamar Rabinovich and R.J. Zwi Werblowsky, and B'nai B'rith lobbyist William Korey. During its history, AIJA attracted more funding from major businessmen and philanthropists than ECAJ. After Isi Leibler settled in Israel in 1995, he came to believed that the Jewish community needed a more effective advocacy group. Following negotiations, AIP and AIJA merged in 1997 to form AIJAC, which became the main Jewish public advocacy group in Australia. 1990s In May 1997, AIJAC and the American Jewish Committee (AJC) established institutional ties to collaborate on key Jewish communal and international policy issues in the Asia-Pacific region. In 1999, AIJAC and the AJC produced a detailed research study called Islam in Asia: Changing Political Realities, which examined the role of Islam in Indonesia, Malaysia, the southern Philippines, and southern Thailand. AIJAC and AJC regarded the growth of Islamic extremism in Asia as a concern for Australian Jews, the wider Australian population, and Israel and have advocated a \\"peaceful, stable, democratic, and prosperous Southeast Asia.\\" In 1998, AIJAC controversially published the far right One Nation party's secret membership list as part of its campaign against far right groups. During the 1998 Queensland state election, AIJAC national chairman Mark Leibler and national policy chairman Colin Rubenstein joined forces with other Australian Jewish organizations including ECAJ, the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation Commission, and the Queensland Jewish Board of Deputies in lobbying Prime Minister John Howard into disavowing any preference deals with One Nation. 2000s In January 2000, AIJAC strongly campaigned against controversial military historian and Holocaust denier David Irving's tour of Australia. AIJAC's National Chairman Mark Leibler also criticized the Herald Sun newspaper for commissioning a poll asking people whether they \\"agreed with historian David Irving's views on the Holocaust\\"; describing it as offensive to Melbourne's Holocaust survivors and arguing that newspaper's actions legitimized the claims of Holocaust deniers. In May 2000, AIJAC condemned the Australian Government's decision to vote in favour of two World Bank loans to Iran worth US$232 million; with AIJAC's Executive Director Rubenstein claiming that the loans legitimized the Iranian \\"regime's\\" religious discrimination, terrorism, and human rights violation. AIJAC's opposition to the Iranian loans was also influenced by the Iranian government's trial and conviction of ten Iranian Jews on fabricated charges of spying for the US and Israel. The Iranian loans were also opposed by the United States, Canadian, and French governments. Historically, AIJAC has urged the Australian Government to exert pressure and limit relations with Iran due to its opposition to the current regime. In December 2000, AIJAC supported the Victorian Government's Racial and Religious Tolerance Act; arguing that free speech had to be balanced with protection from harassment, vilification, incitement to violence, and hate speech. In 2001, AIJAC and most of the Australian Jewish community praised Prime Minister John Howard for condemning the World Conference against Racism 2001 in Durban in September 2001 and praised Australian efforts to moderate the conference's proceedings. Following the September 11 attacks, AIJAC supported the United States-led coalition's War on Terror and military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. AIJAC also campaigned in favour of Australian involvement in the Iraq War. AIJAC and its institutional partner, the American Jewish Committee, were also concerned by the growth of Islamic extremism in Southeast Asia. Following the 2002 Bali bombings, AIJAC exposed the Australian links of Ramzi Yousef, one of the instigators of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and established close links with moderate Southeast Asian leaders such as Indonesian President and Nahdatul Ulama leader Abdurrahman Wahid. In August 2003, AIJAC joined forces with several other Australian Jewish organizations and media including Australian Jewish News, the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies (NSWJBD), the Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ), and the Zionist Federation of Australia in opposing the Sydney Peace Foundation's decision to award Palestinian intellectual and PLO official Dr. Hanan Ashrawi the 2003 Sydney Peace Prize. AIJAC published a fact sheet criticizing Ashrawi for her alleged anti-Israel rhetoric and extremist views. Despite intense lobbying from Jewish groups and media, the Sydney Peace Foundation refused to rescind Ashrawi's prize. On 6 November 2003, New South Wales Premier Bob Carr awarded Ashrawi the 2003 Sydney Peace Prize during a public ceremony at the New South Wales Parliament. In 2005, AIJAC praised Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, claiming that it proved Israel's commitment to peace. AIJAC and most Australian Jewish groups supported the withdrawal from Gaza. AIJAC National Chairman Mark Leibler disagreed with the State Zionist Council of Victoria president Dr Danny Lamm and the State Zionist Council of New South Wales' president Brian Levitan's opposition to the disengagement from Gaza, stating that communal leaders should not express views that \\"are at odds with the views of the constituency.\\" At the same time, Leibler defended the right to protest by elements of the Jewish community opposed to the Gaza disengagement. AIJAC analyst Ted Lapkin claimed that Hamas's electoral success during the 2006 Palestinian legislative election reflected a long record of Palestinians \\"spurning opportunities for peace.\\" 2010s In 2016, AIJAC accused then senator Nick Xenophon of being \\"highly and one-sidedly critical of Israel\\" during his time in the Australian Senate. The organisation also criticised the Australian Greens for trying to make Israel the \\"sole-aggressor\\" against Palestine. In 2018, AIJAC lodged a complaint against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation regarding an online article which claimed that Hamas was declared a terrorist organisation because of it activities against Israeli \\"occupation\\" of Palestine. The ABC complaints unit agreed with AIJAC that Hamas's status was not, according to the Australian Government, based on any occupation. Dr. Rubenstein said: Aims and activities As both a think tank and public affairs organization, AIJAC's stated purpose is to represent the interests of Australian Jews to the Australian government, media, and other media organizations. While AIJAC's main focus is on combating perceived anti- Israel bias and misinformation in the media and Australian public, the organization also has a domestic agenda that includes promoting multiculturalism, human rights and interfaith dialogue; combating extremism, fundamentalism, racism, and anti-Semitism; promoting Holocaust awareness; pursuing Nazi war criminals; and dealing with the security concerns of Australian Jewish communities and institutions. Besides its advocacy and lobbying activities, AIJAC has also produced regular commentary and analysis on Middle Eastern, Australian, and Asian developments. Several of AIJAC's main activities have including a visitor program bringing international visitors to Australia and New Zealand, the \\"Ramban Israel Fellowship\\" program, the \\"AIJAC Forum\\" for young professionals, their monthly Australia/Israel Review magazine, and the \\"Fresh Air\\" blog and \\"Updates\\" email bulletin on their website. Australia/Israel Review AIJAC publishes a monthly magazine, Australia/Israel Review or AIR (formerly titled The Review), featuring articles on issues of concern to the Australian Jewish community. AIR magazine was first established by AIJAC's predecessor, Australia-Israel Publications, in 1977 with the journalist Samp Lipski serving as its first editor. The magazine's mission was to promote the Israeli case to Australia's opinion makers. Copies of AIR magazine were distributed to members of both the federal and state parliaments, leading clergymen, academics, and journalists. By the late 1980s, AIR magazine had a circulation of 3,600 and had become a national publication with the establishment of a branch office in Sydney. Although AIR magazine's mainly focused on Israel-Palestine, the magazine also devoted considerable resources to monitoring far right figures and elements during the 1980s and 1990s such as Pauline Hanson's One Nation, David Irving, Louis Farrakhan, and the LaRouche movement. Key contributors have included Jeremy Jones and David Greason, one of Australia's leading experts on the far right. In 1995, AIR and its parent organization Australia-Israel Publications were merged into AIJAC. Despite its pro-Israel editorial standpoint, AIR magazine has published interviews with Palestinian figures such as Hanan Ashrawi, Yasser Arafat, and Nabil Shaath. In addition, the magazine has interviewed leading Israeli figures such as Benjamin Netanyahu, Moshe Arens, and Shimon Peres. In addition to its pro-Israel advocacy, AIR magazine has also taken an interest in weapons of mass destruction particularly \\"rogue Middle East states\\" seeking to acquire nuclear weapons capability. By 2000, AIR magazine was devoting more coverage to Australian issues and local politics. Current and archived issues of the magazine are available on the magazine's website, and the organisation also distributes news and alerts to subscribers by email. Lobbying and relationship-building AIJAC has lobbied and cultivated relations with the two major Australian parties, the Liberals and Australian Labor Party. AIJAC has invited politicians from both major parties on Ramban programs and dinner functions. In 2003, the Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, federal Opposition and Labor leader Simon Crean, and Labor Foreign spokesperson Kevin Rudd attended an AIJAC dinner function hosting former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. AIJAC also cultivated close relations with Prime Minister John Howard with left-wing Australian journalist Antony Loewenstein crediting the organization with influencing the Howard Government's pro-Israel foreign policy. AIJAC had also maintained a close relationship with Jewish Australian former Labor Member of Parliament Michael Danby, a former AIJAC staffer who has articulated a pro-Israel standpoint on several occasions. Danby was involved in the Australian Parliamentary Friends of Israel and objected to Jewish-American intellectual and dissident Noam Chomsky's tour of Australia in 1995. Partnerships AIJAC works closely with several Australian and international Jewish organizations including the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the Zionist Federation of Australia, the various state Jewish community organizations, the Jewish National Fund, the United Israel Appeal, the World Union of Jewish Students, and the American Jewish Committee. Despite its cordial relations with mainstream Jewish groups, AIJAC disagrees with dissident Jewish peace groups like the Australian Jewish Democratic Society, which is critical of Israel and has advocated on Palestinian rights. In May 1997, AIJAC and the American Jewish Committee established institutional ties to collaborate on key Jewish communal and international policy issues including defending the rights of Jews and other minorities, promoting friendly relations between Jews and other ethnic and religious groups, advocating for Jewish concerns in Asia and the Pacific Rim, advancing Israeli public diplomacy, combating anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial, and fostering ties between Israel and the Jewish Diaspora. The two organizations also collaborate in the joint sponsorship of research, conferences, symposia, exchange programs, and fact-finding missions in the Asia-Pacific region. Pursuit of alleged Nazi war criminals In line with its interest in combating anti-Semitism and promoting Holocaust awareness, AIJAC has campaigned for alleged Nazi war criminals in Australia to face justice either in Australia or overseas via deportation or extradition. AIJAC has also advocated that the Australian Government re-establish a specialized war crimes investigation unit to pursue both suspects from World War II and more recent conflicts, and to assist international efforts to secure war crime justice. During the mid-1990s, AIJAC helped located the alleged Latvian war criminals KonrƒÅds Kalƒìjs and Karlis Ozols, who were both living in Australia. In March 2000, AIJAC also lobbied for the Australian Government to investigate Lithuanian Nazi war crimes suspect Antanas Gudelis following allegations against him aired on the Special Broadcasting Service's Dateline program. Ramban Israel Fellowship Program In late 2003, AIJAC launched the Ramban Israel Fellowship Program to facilitate educational and fact-finding trips to Israel for selected journalists, politicians, political advisers, government officials, trade union officials, student leaders, and academics. Participation includes \\"air/ground transport, accommodation, meals and other associated costs\\". According to Australian Jewish journalist Antony Loewenstein, the week-long Ramban program included meetings with prominent Israeli politicians such as Ehud Barak and Benjamin Netanyahu, a tour of the Israeli West Bank barrier, and brief meetings with Palestinian leaders in Ramallah. The first Ramban participants were a group of young political leaders who undertook a week-long program of activities in July 2003. The second Ramban mission consisted of a five-member Coalition parliamentary delegation who visited Israel in December 2003. The third Ramban mission in February 2004 was a bipartisan parliamentary delegation consisting of Australian Labor Party Senators Stephen Conroy (Victoria), Linda Kirk (South Australia), Ursula Stephens (New South Wales), and Liberal Members of Parliament Steven Ciobo, Sophie Panopoulos, and Andrew Southcott. More recently, in 2018, Senators Stirling Griff (Centre Alliance) and Kristina Keneally (Labor) attended, along with other politicians, as well as journalists, including Sharri Markson and James Campbell. AIJAC Ramban journalist participants have included The Herald and Weekly Times editor in chief Peter Blunden and journalist John Ferguson, the Australian Financial Review Ben Potter and Robert Bolton, The Age chief editorial writer John Watson, The Courier-Mail Denis Atkins, the Special Broadcasting Service's Sally Watson, the Sydney Morning Herald Louise Dodson, and Channel Ten's John Hill. Criticism Palestinian Authority According to Reich, Palestinian Authority officials have expressed criticism of AIJAC's pro-Israel advocacy work and media management. The-then Head of the General Palestinian Delegation to Australia Ali Kazak alleged that AIJAC tried to prevent factual reporting by the Australian media on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Kazak was particularly critical of an AIJAC report criticising the Australian public broadcaster Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), which he claimed tried to suppress what he referred to as \\"Israel's internationally condemned bloody occupation, violations and war crimes committed on a daily basis against the defenceless Palestinian people on the pretext that such coverage is pro- Palestinian.\\" Arab Australians AIJAC has also clashed with local Arab Australian community organisations and media. Executive Director Rubenstein criticised local Arab community groups for alleged hypocrisy in opposing the introduction of the Racial Vilification Act but being the first to use it. He also alleged that local Arabic newspapers and programs promoted extremism. In November 1995, the Australian Arabic Council (ACC) lodged a complaint against AIJAC's predecessor organisation Australia-Israel Publications after a staff member named David Pryce-Jones remarked that it was an Arab habit to assassinate prime ministers in response to the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by Israeli ultranationalist Yigal Amir. In response, the ACC lodged official complaints against AIP and the Herald Sun with the Australian Press Council and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In December 1997, the AIP published a public apology in the Herald Sun. Journalists AIJAC has received criticism for allegedly serving as a pro-Israel lobby group in Australian politics and the media. Left-wing Australian Jewish journalist Antony Loewenstein has criticized AIJAC for promoting a binary view that Israel is committed to seeking peace and that the Palestinians have spurned opportunities for peace, claiming that AIJAC dislikes or distrusts Arabs and Palestinians. Loewenstein has also criticized AIJAC for lobbying the two Australian public broadcasters, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and SBS to conform to a pro-Israel, pro- American, and anti-Arab agenda under the pretext of ensuring balance. Loewenstein has alleged that AIJAC has used the media complaints process to harass ABC and SBS reporters and senior management over their coverage of the First Gulf War, the Battle of Jenin, and the Israel-Palestine conflict. According to Loewenstein, AIJAC has also blocked the airing of documentaries and films sympathetic to the Palestinians such as Hany Abu-Assad's Ford Transit, Yoav Shamir's Checkpoint, and Simone Bitton's The Wall. Loewenstein blamed AIJAC's lobbying campaigns for demoralising journalists, contributing to staff departures, and low morale. He has likened AIJAC's media monitoring activities to that of other pro-Israel watchdogs including HonestReporting and the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America. In response, AIJAC analyst Ted Larkin criticized Loewenstein's book My Israel Question for alleged factual inaccuracies and glossing over the Palestinian Liberation Organization's support for Saddam Hussein and Palestinian suicide bombing. Similarly, senior ABC News and former The Australian journalist John Lyons has criticized AIJAC for favouring pro-Israel journalists while attacking journalists whose reports and stories they did not agree with. Lyons has alleged that critical journalists have received abuse on social media. Lyons cites an attempt by AIJAC to discredit a story that he had published in the Weekend Australian highlighting the plight of a Palestinian travel agent named Nasser Jaber who had been evicted from their home in Jerusalem. According to Lyons, AIJAC was supported in this episode by the Israeli Embassy in Canberra and the Australian Jewish News. Lyons has also claimed that AIJAC tried to sabotage his career as The Australian Jerusalem correspondent by trying to discredit his news reports. He has also criticized AIJAC for pushing Australian foreign policy in a pro-Israel direction. In response, AIR magazine editor Tzvi Fleischer has defended AIJAC's criticisms of Lyons' media reports, alleging that he had an anti-Israel bias. AIJAC senior policy analyst Ahron Shapiro also criticized Lyons' memoir Balcony Over Jerusalem for promoting what he regarded as a distorted, negative image of Israel. Politicians Former Premier of New South Wales and Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr has criticized AIJAC and pro-Israel elements within the Gillard Government for exerting an unhealthy influence on Australian foreign policy towards Israel and the Palestinian Territories in his 2014 memoir Diary of a Foreign Minister; contending that it hurt Australia's relations with the Arab-Muslim world. Carr also clashed with Prime Minister Julia Gillard on Israel, at one point threatening to resign unless Gillard dropped Australia's opposition to Palestinian efforts to upgrade their United Nations membership to non-member observer status. In response to Carr's criticisms, AIJAC National Chairman Mark Leibler defended the group's efforts to lobby Australian Prime Ministers and rejected Carr's claims of a powerful pro-Israel lobby as a \\"figment of his imagination.\\" Leibler also rejected Carr's claims that AIJAC took an extreme right wing view of Israel and reiterated AIJAC's commitment to a two-state solution. AIJAC policy analyst Ahron Shapiro also criticized Carr for attempting to downgrade Australia's relations with Israel. By contrast, Loewenstein has praised Carr for challenging AIJAC, alleging that AIJAC's lobbying activities and Ramban trips promoted a negative view of Palestinians and isolated Australia in international community.

The booklet stated that only publications carried out under the collective oversight of the co-workers should be used in the local churches. Seeking to restrict the churches from using any other material in a widespread way, it discouraged all members from carrying out private publication works. The booklet also stated that this was not a mandate and that \\"the one publication should not become the basis of our accepting or rejecting any persons in the communion of faith or in the fellowship of the churches; it should not be insisted on as an item of the faith. If any are not inclined to be restricted in one publication, these ones are still our brothers; they are still in the genuine local churches.\\" The booklet also states, \\"There is nearly no item of life or light that has not been covered by our publications\\" and describes the benefit of other publications in this way: \\"...the fact that these publications can be produced and distributed should not give them any more credence among the churches than anything else that can be published today, secular or religious. These are simply other publications that our brothers and sisters may or may not be interested in.

After becoming obsolete in the army co-operation role, the aircraft's exceptional short-field performance enabled clandestine missions using small, improvised airstrips behind enemy lines to place or recover agents, particularly in occupied France with the help of the French Resistance. Royal Air Force army co-operation aircraft were named after mythical or historical military leaders; in this case the Spartan admiral Lysander was chosen. Design and development In 1934 the Air Ministry issued Specification A.39/34 for an army co-operation aircraft to replace the Hawker Hector. Initially Hawker Aircraft, Avro and Bristol were invited to submit designs, but after some debate within the Ministry, a submission from Westland was invited as well. The Westland design, internally designated P.8, was the work of Arthur Davenport under the direction of \\"Teddy\\" Petter. It was Petter's second aircraft design and he spent considerable time interviewing Royal Air Force pilots to find out what they wanted from such an aircraft. Less clear was whether he or the pilots understood the army co-operation role and what the army wanted, which was tactical reconnaissance and artillery reconnaissance capability ‚Äì photographic reconnaissance and observation of artillery fire in daylight ‚Äì up to about behind the enemy front. The result of Petter's pilot enquiries suggested that field of view, low-speed handling characteristics and STOL performance were the most important requirements. Westland Lysander Mk III (SD), the type used for special missions into occupied France during World War II. Davenport and Petter designed an aircraft to incorporate these features with unconventional results. The Lysander was designed to be powered by a Bristol Mercury air-cooled radial engine and had high wings and a fixed conventional landing gear mounted on an innovative inverted U square-section tube that supported wing struts at the apex, was in itself resilient, and contained (internal) springs for the faired wheels. The large streamlined spats also each contained a mounting for a Browning machine gun and for small, removable stub wings that could be used to carry light bombs or supply canisters. The wings had a reverse taper towards the root, which gave the impression of a bent gull wing from some angles, although the spars were straight. It had a girder type construction faired with a light wood stringers to give the aerodynamic shape. The forward fuselage was duralumin tube joined with brackets and plates, and the after part was welded stainless steel tubes. Plates and brackets were cut from channel extrusions rather than being formed from sheet steel. The front spar and lift struts were extrusions. The wing itself was fabric covered, and its thickness was maximized at the lift strut anchorage location, similar to that of later marks of the Stinson Reliant high-winged transport monoplane. Despite its appearance, the Lysander was aerodynamically advanced; being equipped with fully automatic wing slats and slotted flapsFlight 1938 p. 572 and a variable incidence tailplane. These refinements gives the Lysander a stalling speed of only 65 mph (104 km/h, 56.5 knots).Taylor 1969, p. 443. It also featured the largest Elektron alloy extrusion made at the time: the one-piece frame, already mentioned, that support the wings and wheels. (This was a feature of British-built aircraft only ‚Äì Canadian-built machines had a conventionally fabricated assembly due to the difficulties involved in manufacturing such a large extrusion.) The Air Ministry requested two prototypes of the P.8 and the competing Bristol Type 148, quickly selecting the Westland aircraft for production and issuing a contract in September 1936. The high-lift devices gave the Lysander a short take off and landing (\\"STOL\\") performance much appreciated by the Special Duties pilots such as Squadron Leader Hugh Verity. The wings were equipped with automatic slats which lifted away from the leading edge as the airspeed decreased towards stalling speed. These slats controlled automatic flaps. Slow speed flight was therefore greatly simplified, \\"and it was possible to bring a Lysander down to land, if not like a lift, at least like an escalator.\\"Verity 1978 p. 15 The inboard slats were connected to the flaps and to an air damper in the port wing which governed the speed at which the slats operated. The outboard slats operated independently and were not interconnected, and each was fitted with an air damper. On a normal approach, the inboard slats and the flaps would begin to open when the airspeed has dropped to about 85 mph (136 km/h, 74 knots) and be approximately half down at 80 mph (129 km/h, 70 knots). The only control that the pilot has is a locking lever which he can set to lock the flaps down once they have been lowered automatically.Wake-Walker 2014 p. 64 Operational history United Kingdom December 1942. Four Lysander Mk IIIAs of No. 1433 Flight RAF, in Madagascar, shortly after the official end of the Madagascar campaign The first Lysanders entered service in June 1938, equipping squadrons for army co-operation and were initially used for message- dropping and artillery spotting. When war broke out in Europe, the earlier Mk Is had been largely replaced by Mk IIs, the older machines heading for the Middle East. Some of these aircraft, now designated type L.1, operated with the Chindits of the British Indian Army in the Burma Campaign of the Second World War.Masters, John. The Road Past Mandalay. London: Bengal-Rockland, 1961. . Four regular squadrons equipped with Lysanders accompanied the British Expeditionary Force to France in October 1939, and were joined by a further squadron early in 1940. Following the German invasion of France and the low countries on 10 May 1940, Lysanders were put into action as spotters and light bombers. In spite of occasional victories against German aircraft, they made very easy targets for the Luftwaffe even when escorted by Hurricanes.Air International, January 1984, pp. 26‚Äì27.March 1998, p. 243. Withdrawn from France during the Dunkirk evacuation, they continued to fly supply-dropping missions to Allied forces from bases in England; on one mission to drop supplies to troops trapped at Calais, 14 of 16 Lysanders and Hawker Hectors that set out were lost. 118 Lysanders were lost in or over France and Belgium in May and June 1940, of a total of 175 deployed.James 1991, p. 247. With the fall of France, it was clear that the type was unsuitable for the coastal patrol and army co-operation role, being described by Air Marshal Arthur Barratt, commander-in-chief of the British Air Forces in France as \\"quite unsuited to the task; a faster, less vulnerable aircraft was required.\\"Air International January 1984, p. 27. The view of Army AOP pilots was that the Lysander was too fast for artillery spotting purposes, too slow and unmanoeuverable to avoid fighters, too big to conceal quickly on a landing field, too heavy to use on soft ground and had been developed by the RAF without ever asking the Army what was needed. Nevertheless, throughout the remainder of 1940, Lysanders flew dawn and dusk patrols off the coastRickard, J. \\"No. 613 Squadron (RAF): Second World War\\", HistoryOfWar.org, 6 April 2012. and in the event of an invasion of Britain, they were tasked with attacking the landing beaches with light bombs and machine guns.\\"RAF Museum: Westland Lysander III.\\" Royal Air Force Museum, 2012. Retrieved: 23 December 2012. They were replaced in the home-based army co-operation role from 1941 by camera- equipped fighters such as the Curtiss Tomahawk and North American Mustang carrying out reconnaissance operations, while light aircraft such as the Taylorcraft Auster were used to direct artillery.Air International February 1984, p. 81. Some UK-based Lysanders went to work operating air-sea rescue, dropping dinghies to downed RAF aircrew in the English Channel.Air International February 1984, p. 82. Fourteen squadrons and flights were formed for this role in 1940 and 1941. Special duties OSS officer. In August 1941 a new squadron, No. 138 (Special Duties), was formed to undertake missions for the Special Operations Executive to maintain clandestine contact with the French Resistance. Among its aircraft were Lysander Mk IIIs, which flew over and landed in occupied France. While general supply drops could be left to the rest of No. 138's aircraft, the Lysander could insert and remove agents from the continent or retrieve Allied aircrew who had been shot down over occupied territory and had evaded capture. For this role the Mk IIIs were fitted with a fixed ladder over the port side to hasten access to the rear cockpit and a large drop tank under the belly. In order to slip in unobtrusively Lysanders were painted matte black overall (some early examples had brown/green camouflaged upper surfaces and later examples had grey/green upper surfaces); operations almost always took place within a week of a full moon, as moonlight was essential for navigation. The aircraft undertook such duties until the liberation of France in 1944. Lysanders were based at airfields at Newmarket and later Tempsford, but used regular RAF stations to fuel-up for the actual crossing, particularly RAF Tangmere. Flying without any navigation equipment other than a map and compass, Lysanders would land on short strips of land, such as fields, marked out by four or five torches or to avoid having to land, the agent, wearing a special padded suit, stepped off at very low altitude and rolled to a stop on the field. They were originally designed to carry one passenger in the rear cockpit, but for SOE use the rear cockpit was modified to carry two passengers in extreme discomfort in case of urgent necessity.Griffiths, Frank, Winged Hours, 1981, p. 12. The pilots of No. 138 and from early 1942, No. 161 Squadron transported 101 agents to and recovered 128 agents from Nazi-occupied Europe.Gunston, Bill. Classic World War II Aircraft Cutaways. London: Osprey, 1995. . The Germans knew little about the British aircraft and wished to study one. Soldiers captured an intact Lysander in March 1942 when its pilot was unable to destroy it after a crash, but a train hit the truck carrying the Lysander, destroying the cargo.Breuer 2000, pp. 135‚Äì137. Lysanders also filled other less glamorous roles, such as service as target-towing and communication aircraft. Two aircraft (T1443 and T1739) were transferred to the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) for training and 18 were used by the Royal Navy‚Ä≤s Fleet Air Arm. All British Lysanders were withdrawn from service in 1946. Free French Lysander also joined the ranks of the Forces A√©riennes Fran√ßaises Libres (Free French Air Force, FAFL) when Groupe Mixte de Combat (GMC) 1, formed at RAF Odiham on 29 August 1940, was sent to French North-West Africa in order to persuade the authorities in countries such as Gabon, Cameroon and Chad, which were still loyal to Vichy France, to join the Gaullist cause against the Axis powers, and to attack Italian ground forces in Libya. As with all FAFL aircraft, Lysanders sported the Cross of Lorraine insignia on the fuselage and the wings instead of the French tricolor roundel first used in 1914, to distinguish their aircraft from those flying for the Vichy French Air Force. Lysanders were mostly employed on reconnaissance missions, but were also used to carry out occasional attacks. In all, 24 Lysanders were used by the FAFL. Canada RCAF Station Rockcliffe, Ontario. Victoria in 1944 with black and yellow stripes. One hundred and four British-built Lysanders were delivered to Canada supplementing 225 that were built under license by National Steel Car at Malton, Ontario (near Toronto) with production starting in October 1938 and the first aircraft flying in August 1939. The RCAF primarily operated Lysanders in the army co-operation role, where they represented a major improvement over the antiquated Westland Wapiti which could trace its origins back to 1916. Initial training was conducted at RCAF Station Rockcliffe (near Ottawa, Ontario) with No. 123 Squadron running an army co-operation school there. Units that operated the Lysander for training in this role in Canada include 2 Squadron, 110 Squadron (which became 400 Squadron overseas) and No. 112 Squadron. No. 414 squadron formed overseas and joined 110 Squadron and 112 Squadron with Lysanders. Prior to going overseas 2 Squadron was disbanded and its airmen reassigned to 110 and 112 Squadrons to bring them up to war establishment (2 Squadron would later reform in England as a Hawker Hurricane unit and eventually be renumbered as 402 Squadron). In all there were three squadrons ready to begin operations against the Axis Powers. Although Operation Sea Lion ‚Äì the planned German invasion of Great Britain ‚Äì was averted by the British victory in the Battle of Britain in 1940, the high losses suffered by RAF Lysanders in the Battle of France resulted in any plans for cross-channel offensive operations by Lysanders being put on hold, although the Canadian squadrons continued training with the Lysanders until suitable replacements were available. No. 118 Squadron and No. 122 Squadron were the only Canadian units to use their Lysanders on active-duty operations ‚Äì 118 in Saint John, New Brunswick, and 122 at various locations on Vancouver Island, where they performed anti-submarine patrols and conducted search-and-rescue operations. During the same period, No. 121 Squadron and several Operational Training Units (OTUs) used Lysanders ‚Äì painted in a high- visibility yellow-and-black-striped scheme ‚Äì for target towing duties.Kostenuk and Griffin 1977, p. 56. For a brief period in 1940 when every available Hurricane fighter had been sent overseas to fight in the Battle of Britain, leaving the RCAF without a modern fighter aircraft at home in Canada, two RCAF Lysander-equipped squadrons which were supposed to convert to fighter aircraft but had none to convert to were re-designated as operational fighter squadrons. 111 Squadron, a coastal artillery squadron which earlier had replaced its Avro trainers with Lysanders and been reclassified as an army co- operation unit, was again reclassified as a fighter squadron ‚Äì the only one on the Canadian west coast ‚Äì in June 1940. Lysander-equipped 118 Squadron also was redesignated as a fighter squadron. The Lysander completely lacked the capability to operate in a fighter role, and neither squadron saw action as a fighter unit while equipped with Lysanders, but their designation as fighter squadrons did allow RCAF fighter pilots to work up at a critical time without having to wait for the arrival of true fighter aircraft. No. 118 Squadron was disbanded in September 1940, and when it reformed in December 1940, still as a fighter squadron, it was equipped with 15 old, otherwise unwanted Grumman Goblin fighters produced by Canadian Car and Foundry. Both 111 and 118 Squadrons soon re-equipped with the Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk, bringing the brief service of Lysanders in fighter squadrons to an end. By late 1944 all Canadian Lysanders had been withdrawn from flying duties. Other countries Other export customers for the Lysander included the Finnish Air Force (which received four Mk I and nine Mk III aircraft), the Irish Air Corps (which took delivery of six Mk II aircraft), the Turkish Air Force (which received 36 Mk IIs), the Portuguese Air Force (which took delvery of eight Mk IIIA aircraft), the United States Army Air Forces (which received 25), the Indian Air Force (which took delivery of 22) and No. 1 Squadron of the Royal Egyptian Air Force.Steve Rothwell, Military Ally or Liability, The Egyptian Army 1936-42, accessed June 2020. The REAF received 20 aircraft. Egyptian Lysanders were the last to see active service, against Israel in the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war. Civilian use After the war a number of surplus ex-Royal Canadian Air Force Lysanders were employed as aerial applicators with Westland Dusting Service, operating in Alberta and western Canada.Milberry 1979, pp. 98, 213. Two of these were saved for inclusion in Lynn Garrison's collection for display in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Production A total of 1,786 Lysanders were built, including 225 manufactured under licence by National Steel Car in Toronto, Ontario, Canada during the late 1930s.Milberry 1979, p. 116.

All have contributed various elements to the overall style seen worldwide today. Hip hop fashion complements the expressions and attitudes of hip hop culture and has changed significantly during its history. Today, it is a prominent fashion worn across the whole world and popular with all ethnicities.  Late 1970s to mid-1980s  In the late 1970s, sportswear and fashion brands such as Le Coq Sportif, Kangol, Adidas and Pro-Keds were established, attaching themselves to the emerging hip hop scene. During the 1980s, hip hop icons wore brightly colored name-brand tracksuits, sheepskin and leather bomber jackets, backpiece jackets,https://issuu.com/niklasworisch/docs/backpiece_jackets_web_final Clarks shoes, Britishers (also known as British walkers) and sneakers. The brand of sneaker that hip hop icons would use included Pro-Keds, Puma, Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars and Adidas Superstars often with oversized or \\"phat\\" shoelaces. Popular haircuts ranged from the early-1980s Jheri curl to the early-1990s hi-top fade, popularized by Will Smith (The Fresh Prince) and Christopher \\"Kid\\" Reid of Kid 'n Play, among others. Another trend in hip hop clothing, pioneered by Dapper Dan in the early 1980s, was the adaptation and brandishing of high-net-worth fashion house brands such as Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Gucci and logos in custom-designed tracksuits, jackets and mink coats. Trending accessories included large eyeglasses (Cazals), Kangol bucket hats, nameplates, name belts,, multiple rings and heavy gold jewelry.Keyes, p. 152. In general, men's jewelry focused on heavy gold chains and women's jewelry on large gold earrings. Performers such as Kurtis Blow and Big Daddy Kane helped popularize gold necklaces and other such jewelry, and female rappers such as Roxanne Shant√© and the group Salt-N-Pepa helped popularize oversized gold door-knocker earrings. The heavy jewelry was suggestive of prestige and wealth, and some have connected the style to Africanism. MC Schoolly D, for instance, claimed that wearing gold \\"is not something that was born and raised in America. This goes back to Africa... the artists in the rap field are battling. We're the head warriors. We got to stand up and say we're winning battles, and this is how we're doing it.\\"Quoted in Keyes, p. 152 (quoting Schoolly D. \\"The Meaning of Gold.\\" Spin (October 1988), p. 52). 1980s hip hop fashion is remembered as one of the most important elements of old school hip hop, and is often celebrated in nostalgic hip hop songs such as Ahmad's 1994 single \\"Back in the Day\\", and Missy Elliott's 2002 single of the same name. According to Gwendolyn O'Neal, the author of African American Aesthetics of Dress (1997), \\"while an African-American aesthetic of dress is neither African nor American, it is shaped by unique ‚Äòcultural‚Äô experiences resulting from being of African descent and living in America.\\" The rapper Jay-Z echoed this in a Black Book Magazine interview; he defended the upper-class tastes of fashion in the hip hop culture as \\"living it on our terms, instead of trying to emulate an elite lifestyle\\" with the wearing of high-net-worth fashion house brands. It is not necessarily because of conspicuous consumption that the hip hop lifestyle brought in these high end fashion products.  Preppy  Preppy looks also caught on with 80s youth in the first wave of hip hop influence. \\"This group of black yuppy wannabes or ‚Äòbuppies‚Äô rocked to 80s hip hop music and wore styles from Polo, The Timberland and Tommy Hilfiger ... [and] were drawn to Hilfiger because of its all-American, WASP-y, country club feeling‚Äîit was exclusive and aspirational\\". The immense popularity of the brand Tommy Hilfiger among the hip hop subculture community then led to the brand's global expansion.  Celebrity influence  As music played a significant role in the way people dressed during the 1990s, many celebrities were known as fashion icons, especially rappers. Legendary rapper, Tupac, was not only known for his resonating lyrics, but also his timeless style. He was seen as a trend setter during that period and bandanas paired with baggy overalls or Red Wings jersey was known to be his classic style. In return, he made bandanas into an iconic headwear accessory. Today, his fashion influences has taught society to be more acceptable towards different styles as well as inspired fashion designers from all over the world to be innovative towards their designs. Furthermore, Snoop Dogg's strong charisma and his laid-back approach to his rhymes complemented his flannel and sweatshirts with Chucks. When he revamped his style to a cleaner cut of suited and booted look, his Doberman-like facial features and slender frame were masked by his charisma and chic vibe. He has since influenced people that with pride comes with confidence, which is the key of feeling comfortable and looking good in your individual fashion style. Moreover, hip hop has also adopted and then transformed traditional or \\"old world\\" luxury symbols and made them modern- day, \\"cool\\" commodities. Rapper LL Cool J wore a Kangol hat back in the 1980s, when few Americans knew anything about the European hat maker, but its association with hip hop would invigorate the brand. In 2003, London-based Kangol acknowledged the popularity given its sixty-year-old brand by a young LL Cool J in 1983.  Late 1980s to early 1990s  Black nationalism was increasingly influential in rap during the late 1980s, and fashions and hairstyles reflected traditional African influences. Blousy pants were popular among dance-oriented rappers like M.C. Hammer. Fezzes, kufis decorated with the Kemetic ankh, Kente cloth hats, Africa chains, dreadlocks, and Black Nationalist colors of red, black, and green became popular as well, promoted by artists such as Queen Latifah, KRS-One, Public Enemy, and X-Clan. Hip-hop fashion in the 1990s slowly evolved from the 1980s as the hip-hop community started getting influenced by traditional African-American dressing. Bright colors, large pants and headwear were the elements, which inspired the style of dressing in the early 1990s. Will Smith's character from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is a distinctive example of the classic style and fashion trends of the 1990s. His character is always seen dressed in bright colorful garments, throwback jerseys and a baseball cap. In addition, rappers like Kid ‚Äôn Play, Left Eye of TLC also popularized the bright colored clothing and baseball caps. TLC and late R&B; singer Aaliyah also created a fashion trend among women. Baggy pants paired with a crop top or a sports bra and occasionally a big flannel was one of their many iconic looks. This was to show their own version of femininity, and to express that everything does not have to be form-fitting and tight in order to be sexy. Cross Colors is known to be the very first streetwear brand and hip-hop movement, which was established in 1989. The brand went by a proposition, \\"clothes without prejudice\\". The company's theory was aimed specifically to the black youth. They used their clothing to voice out political and social issues the black community faced being the minority. Celebrities like Muhammad Ali, TLC, Will Smith and so on were seen dressed in their attire. Currently, the brand seeks unity, equality and empowerment to the new generation. Kris Kross established the fad of wearing clothes backwards. Kwam√© sparked a brief trend of polka-dot clothing. In 1984, Nike collaborated with Michael Jordan to create the well-known basketball shoes, the Air Jordans. Even though the price point ranged from US$100 (which was considered a high price point then), it did not stop people from lining up hours just to get their hands on a pair of these shoes. To date, Air Jordans are still widely worn by basketball players, and with Nike releasing retro versions from time to time, which sell out globally within minutes of the release date. Other clothing brands such as Reebok, Kangol, Fila, Champion, Carhartt, and Timberland were closely associated with the hip hop scene, particularly on the East coast with hip hop acts such as Wu-Tang Clan and Gangstarr sporting the look. Adidas also had big impact in streets with RUN-D.M.C when the band's now iconic hit song \\"My Adidas\\" drop in 1986. Gangsta rap pioneers N.W.A popularized an early form of street style in the late 1980s from the African American gangs and hustler cliques who were there mimicking cholo fashion. This included Dickies pants, white T-shirts, Locs sunglasses, Air Jordan sneakers, with black Raiders snapback hats and Raiders Starter jackets. These jackets were also a popular trend in their own right in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They became something of a status symbol, with incidents of robberies of the jackets reported in the media. Hip hop fashion in this period also influenced high fashion designs. In the late 1980s, Isaac Mizrahi, inspired by his elevator operator who wore a heavy gold chain, showed a collection deeply influenced by hip hop fashion.Wilbekin, p. 280. Models wore black catsuits, \\"gold chains, big gold nameplate-inspired belts, and black bomber jackets with fur-trimmed hoods.\\" Womenswear Daily called the look \\"homeboy chic.\\" In the early 1990s, Chanel showed hip hop-inspired fashion in several shows. In one, models wore black leather jackets and piles of gold chains. In another, they wore long black dresses accessorized with heavy, padlocked silver chains. (These silver chains were remarkably similar to the metal chain-link and padlock worn by Treach of Naughty by Nature, who said he did so in solidarity with \\"all the brothers who are locked down.) The hip hop trend in high fashion, however, did not last.  Mid- to late 1990s   Fashion among \\"hip hop\\" elites  On the East Coast, members of the hip hop community looked back to the gangsters of the 1930s and 1940s for inspiration.Wilbekin, p. 281. Mafioso influences, especially and primarily inspired by the 1983 remake version of Scarface, became popular in hip hop. Many rappers set aside gang-inspired clothing in favor of classic gangster fashions such as bowler hats, double-breasted suits, silk shirts, and alligator-skin shoes (\\"gators\\"). This look transcended into the R&B; world in the mid-1990s when Jodeci came onto the scene, who were crooners but with a more edgy and sexual look. By wearing gangster-style clothes along with the bad-boy attitude and being a R&B; group, they appealed to both men and women. They were particularly known for their baggy clothing, symbolising a hand-me- down from an older relative with a bigger build, as a sign of toughness. On the East Coast, \\"ghetto fabulous\\" fashion (a term coined by Sean Combs) was on the rise.  Urban streetwear  Rapper Slim Thug wearing a do-rag Tommy Hilfiger was one of the most prominent brands in 1990s sportswear, though Polo Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, Nautica, and DKNY were also popular.Wilbekin, p. 282. Snoop Doggy Dogg wore a striped Hilfiger rugby shirt during an appearance on Saturday Night Live, and it sold out of New York City stores the next day. Furthermore, Tommy Hilfiger tube tops were also a big hit within the hip-hop community. It was considered a \\"must-have\\" piece for every girl influenced by this music genre. Artists like TLC, the late Aaliyah and so on were commonly seen in events dressed in it. Hilfiger's popularity was due to its perceived waspiness, which made it seem exclusive and aspirational. Hilfiger courted the new hip hop market: black models featured prominently in the company's advertising campaigns, and rappers like Puffy and Coolio walked during its runways shows. Karl Kani was another influential designer who merged hip hop with fashion.Karl Kani Other brands, such as Nike, Jordan, FUBU, Southpole, Reebok Pro-Keds, Adidas, Eck≈ç Unltd., Mecca USA, Lugz, Rocawear, Boss Jeans by IG Design, and Enyce, arose to capitalize on the market for urban streetwear.  Throwback clothing  Jim Jones and Juelz Santana of Dipset One sportswear trend that emerged was the rise in popularity of throwback jerseys, such as those produced by Mitchell & Ness. Sports jerseys have always been popular in hip hop fashion, as evidenced by Will Smith's early 1990s video \\"Summertime\\", and Spike Lee wearing a throwback Brooklyn Dodgers jersey in the film Do the Right Thing. The late 1990s saw the rise in popularity of very expensive throwbacks, often costing hundreds of dollars. Hip hop artists donning the pricey jerseys in music videos led to increased demand, and led to the rise of counterfeiters flooding the market with fake jerseys to capitalize on the craze. The mid-to-late 2000s saw a decrease in popularity of throwbacks, with some hip hop artists even shunning them. The \\"hip-pop\\" era also saw the split between male and female hip hop fashion, which had previously been more or less similar. Women in hip hop had emulated the male tough-guy fashions such as baggy pants, \\"Loc\\" sunglasses, tough looks and heavy workboots; many, such as Da Brat, accomplished this with little more than some lip gloss and a bit of make-up to make the industrial work pants and work boots feminine. The female performers who completely turned the tide, such as Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown, popularized glamorous, high-fashion feminine hip hop styles, such as Kimora Lee Simmons' fashion line of Baby Phat. Lauryn Hill and Eve popularized more conservative styles that still maintained both a distinctly feminine and distinctly hip hop feel.  Bling  In the mid- to late 1990s, platinum replaced gold as the metal of choice in hip hop fashion. Artists and fans alike wore platinum (or silver-colored) jewelry, often embedded with diamonds. Juvenile and The Hot Boys were largely responsible for this trend. Platinum fronts also became popular; Cash Money Records executive/rapper Brian \\"Baby\\" Williams has an entire mouthful of permanent platinum teeth. Others have fashioned grills, removable metal jewelled teeth coverings. With the advent of the jewellery culture, the turn-of-the-century- established luxury brands made inroads into the hip hop market, with brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton and 212 Diamond City making appearances in hip hop videos and films.  Modern (2000s‚Äì2010s)  Kanye West performing in 2006, wearing a fitted sportcoat In the 1990s and beyond, many hip hop artists and executives started their own fashion labels and clothing lines.Wilbekin, p. 283. Notable examples include Wu-Tang Clan (Wu-Wear), Pharrell (Billionaire Boys Club/Ice Cream), Nelly (Vokal and Apple Bottom Jeans), Russell Simmons (Phat Farm), Kimora Lee Simmons (Baby Phat), Diddy (Sean John and Enyce), T.I. (AKOO), Damon Dash and Jay-Z (Rocawear), 50 Cent (G-Unit Clothing), Eminem (Shady Limited), 2Pac (Makaveli Branded), OutKast (OutKast Clothing), Lil Wayne (Trukfit), and Kanye West (Yeezy). Up-and-coming urban clothing lines have dominated the fashion in the hip hop genre. Skinny jeans also came into style in part due to New Boyz' jerk dance from the song \\"You're a Jerk\\". Common wearing a t-shirt and tight jeans The hip hop fashion trends of the 2000s were all over the place and changed constantly, starting with the baller-type image. Michael Jordan's cover on Sports Illustrated was an iconic moment in hip-hop fashion because he was able to influence millions of people into the direction of baggy shorts, baggy tops, and gold chains. There have been other celebrity influences among fashion trends, with most of these influences coming from hip hop artists. Gucci and Louis Vuitton became extremely popular among the hip hop/urban community from the use of the words, \\"Gucci\\" and \\"Louis\\" in lyrics and music videos. Throughout these years many fashion trends from the 1980s and early 1990s were made popular again, such as door knocker earrings and form fitting jeans for men. Bright colors and cartoon graphic print hoodies by Bathing Ape made popular by artist and producer Pharrell also gained popularity. Women wore high heels in all different forms, and many new ideas for shoes emerged, like the open toed boot. In recent years the hip hop world has seen a resurgence of old fads as well as the emergence of new ones. The last few years of the first decade of the new millennia gave rise to the popularity of tattoos covering artists from head to toe. Soulja Boy, Wiz Khalifa, Lil Wayne and Tyga have set the trend of being completely \\"tatted up.\\"hop%E2%80%99s-most-off-the-dome-tattoo-addicts/ \\"Ink Heads, Hip-Hop's Most Off the Dome Tattoo Addicts\\" xxlmag.com, December 1, 2009.

Tattoos covering the face and the head have also become increasingly popular. Birdman now sports a star tattoo on the crown of his head, Gucci Mane has an ice cream tattoo on his right cheek, and Lil Wayne has tattoos on his eyelids and forehead.\\"Lil Wayne, Gucci Mane And Game: A Journey Into Face Tattoos\\" rapflix.mtv.com, February 23, 2011.

Stars such as Rihanna, Cassie and Kelis have all set the new trend of the half-shaven head.\\"Rihanna's shaved head for 'Italian Vogue. s2smagazine.com, July 7, 2009. Date Accessed: May 10, 2011. The reemergence of Adidas track jackets and the use of fashion scarves have been some of the latest trends to hit the hip hop fashion scene. Adidas tracksuits are certainly not new to hip hop culture, as they have been around essentially since commercialized hip hop was created, but they have recently once again become popular. Fashion scarves have also become popularized in recent years. Kanye West is the most recent artist to launch his own line of products by selling decorative scarves with provocative depictions, named Risque Scarves.\\"Kanye West's Risque Scarf Line Coming Up\\". sojones.com, May 9, 2011. Date Accessed: May 10, 2011 Skateboarding fashion has been used in the hip hop scene since the early 2010s, including knit caps, bonnets, fitted pants or shorts, Vans, Nike SB (skateboarding), shirts with sleeves and trinted Tees (brands like OBEY, Supreme, Stussy, Adidas, Supra, Circa, DC, RDS and Emericas). Chris Brown, Tyler The Creator and Lil Wayne wear these in their music videos and concerts. The rebirth of the 1990s snapback caps is the most notable sign of the new school throwback image. The \\"new\\" snapback hype started around mid-2010. Around late 2010 and early 2011, the \\"new\\" snapback movement exploded. Starter Clothing Line manufactured the most sought-after snapbacks in the 1990s, and made its return as the hype for the hats grew. Many other well-known hat companies started to sell snapbacks, such as New Era, Mitchell & Ness, Reebok, and Adidas. Many notable artists are credited with the comeback of snapbacks by sporting gear from a company named Ti$A VI$ION. Chris Brown, Tyga, and Big Sean were among the early supporters of this company since 2010. Many urban fashionistas credit Mac Miller, a well- known YouTube MC, with starting the hype with the release of his song entitled \\"Snap Back\\", from the mixtape The Jukebox: Prelude to Class Clown, released in June 2009. There is controversy as to who started the \\"new\\" snapback trend. Hip hop fashion through 2011 included snapbacks, sports wear, basketball and skateboarding shoes, hoodies, piercings in one ear or both, leather jackets, sleeveless shirts, polo shirts, saggy pants, bikini tops, crop tops, tube tops, tank tops, factory trackies and cropped T-shirts. Around 2012, fashion in hip hop saw a shift towards modern \\"high\\" streetwear and haute couture brands popularized by online fashion forums such as Superfuture and Styleforum. Brands such as Rick Owens, Raf Simons, and Saint Laurent Paris are now featured prominently in the lyrics and wardrobes of rappers such as A$AP Rocky, Travis Scott, and Kanye West. Skater culture is also prominent in the Hip-Hop scene. The boost in its popularity is largely attributed to alternetive rapper and leader of the musical group Odd Future, Tyler, The Creator. Brands like Obey, Supreme, Thrasher, and Tyler, The Creator's merchandise line, Golf Wang have also boosted the significance of skater fashion in Hip-Hop.  Criticism  DJ wearing a zip-up hoodie and checkerboard frame sunglasses Commentators from both inside and outside the hip hop community have criticized the cost of many of the accoutrements of hip hop fashion. Chuck D of Public Enemy summarized the mentality of hip hop fashion and some low-income youths as \\"Man, I work at McDonald's, but in order for me to feel good about myself I got to get a gold chain or I got to get a fly car in order to impress a sister or whatever.\\"Keyes, p. 172 (quoting Eure and Spady, 1991). In his 1992 song \\"Us\\", Ice Cube rapped that \\"Us niggaz will always sing the blues / 'cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes\\".Quoted in Keyes, p. 173. Some fans have expressed disappointment with the increased amount of advertising for expensive hip hop brands in hip hop magazines. In one letter to the editor in Source magazine, a reader wrote that the magazine should \\"try showing some less expensive brands so heads will know they don't have to hustle, steal, or rob and blast shots for flyness.\\"Quoted in Keyes, p. 172. In fact, there were many highly publicized robberies of hip hop artists by the late 1990s. Guru of Gang Starr was robbed of his Rolex watch at gunpoint, Queen Latifah's car was car-jacked, and Prodigy was robbed at gunpoint of $300,000 in jewelry. Hip hop has sometimes come under fire for glorifying brands that shut it out and for embracing a fashion culture which does not embrace hip hop or black culture.hop-kanye-kimmel-classism-model- casting/525840f978c90a26c40004a5/ \\"Is Fashion Racist?\\" Hufftington Post Live, October 16, 2013. Date accessed: December 8, 2013 A dichotomy exists in the \\"collaboration\\" between influential hip hop artists who embrace designer brands and fashions, and these same brands that profit from hip hop's influencers. Designer brands such as Louis Vuitton or Versace align themselves with influential musicians because of the potential gains, but simultaneously maintain distance from these allies outside of advertising, \\"almost as with a keen desire to hold the controlling hand in these relationships\\" and control their public image.Miller, Janice. Fashion and Music. Oxford: Berg, 2011. Print. p. 17 In these partnerships/collaborations between designers and artists there is sometimes a pattern of exploitation in which the designers benefit disproportionately more than hip hop artists. A few hip hop insiders, such as the members of Public Enemy, Immortal Technique, Paris and Common, have made the deliberate choice not to don expensive jewelry as a statement against materialism.Keyes, p. 172.  Gender roles and dress   Women  Along with the turning of the tide by select female hip hop artists came the emergence of promoting sex appeal through fashion. Female artists have faced a number of pressures ranging from gaining exposure to further their careers as well as conforming with certain images to remain in demand and relevant. Female rappers in today's time like Cardi B and Nicki Minaj are two of the most popular female rappers and still conform to this standard. The alignment of R&B; music with hip hop music (with collaborations being more and more prevalent) placed a whole new category of women within the categorization of what constituted a hip hop artist. As referenced above, the nineties centered around women's senses of style revolving around that of men, in that they adopted the use of oversized T-shirts and baggy pants. Also listed above are Aaliyah, TLC, and Da' Brat as conformists to that trend. Female rap group Salt-N-Pepa are considered amongst the frontrunners in leading the transition of moving away from the male alignment and asserting feminism in creating a new sense of dress. They are said to have \\"wowed fans while wearing hot pants, cut-off denim shorts and Lycra body suits\\". \\"Black women's relationships to their bodies occur within overlapping cultural contexts that offer contradictory messages about their value and function\\". In a male dominated society, it is no wonder that women used to work hard to align themselves with male images including how they'd dressed. As women generally gained access to and exposure within the offerings of several sectors of society, for example music, movies and television, we saw more images of what constituted attractiveness emerge. Following this came the perception of freedom to express oneself through several avenues including apparel. Rappers Lil' Kim and Eve are known for resorting to trends surrounding being scantily clad with provocative tattoos and being perceived as attractive in the process. Not all female rappers, or female artists in general have resorted to these methods within their careers. \\"...the recent appearance of Black women performers, songwriters, and producers in Black popular culture has called attention to the ways in which young Black women use popular culture to negotiate social existence and attempt to express independence, self-reliance, and agency\\". LGBT community and gender variance Hip hop has had a history of homophobia, only recently becoming more accepting of the LGBT community. Lyrics that openly use derogatory words such as \\"fag\\" or \\"dyke\\" have saturated the market, even being found in conscious rap, considered the most progressive section of hip hop. Marc Lamont Hill argues, \\"the progressive agendas of political rap artists such as Public Enemy, X-Clan, Paris, and Sista Souljah were strongly informed by radical Afrocentric, Black Islamic, and crude Black Nationalist ideologies that were openly hostile to queer identities\\". The genre has been considered a predominantly hyper-masculine community, with female artists taking on these traits. Female groups and individual artists such as Young M.A. Conscious Daughters or Aaliyah have dressed in clothing considered male. Wearing baggy clothes was an attempt to shift focus away from the body and move it towards the music. Men have also engaged in reversing gender roles through the use of fashion. Artists such as Lil Wayne, A$AP Rocky, Kanye West, Young Thug, and other self-identified straight men have made headlines by their choices of dress. This type of androgynous dress is not exclusive to recent times though, as the years of hip hop's creation saw legends dressed in the disco styles of that era.

When the number of variables is two, a level set is generically a curve, called a level curve, contour line, or isoline. So a level curve is the set of all real-valued solutions of an equation in two variables x1 and x2. When n = 3, a level set is called a level surface (see also isosurface), and for higher values of n the level set is a level hypersurface. So a level surface is the set of all real-valued roots of an equation in three variables x1, x2 and x3, and a level hypersurface is the set of all real-valued roots of an equation in n (n > 3) variables. A level set is a special case of a fiber. Alternative names Intersections of a co- ordinate function's level surfaces with a trefoil knot. Red curves are closest to the viewer, while yellow curves are farthest. Level sets show up in many applications, often under different names. For example, an implicit curve is a level curve, which is considered independently of its neighbor curves, emphasizing that such a curve is defined by an implicit equation. Analogously, a level surface is sometimes called an implicit surface or an isosurface. The name isocontour is also used, which means a contour of equal height. In various application areas, isocontours have received specific names, which indicate often the nature of the values of the considered function, such as isobar, isotherm, isogon, isochrone, isoquant and indifference curve.  Examples  Consider the 2-dimensional Euclidean distance: d(x, y) = \\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} A level set L_r(d) of this function consists of those points that lie at a distance of r from the origin, otherwise known as a circle. For example, (3, 4) \\\\in L_5(d), because d(3, 4) = 5. Geometrically, this means that the point (3, 4) lies on the circle of radius 5 centered at the origin. More generally, a sphere in a metric space (M, m) with radius r centered at x \\\\in M can be defined as the level set L_r(y \\\\mapsto m(x, y)). A second example is the plot of Himmelblau's function shown in the figure to the right. Each curve shown is a level curve of the function, and they are spaced logarithmically: if a curve represents L_x, the curve directly \\"within\\" represents L_{x/10}, and the curve directly \\"outside\\" represents L_{10x}. Log-spaced level curve plot of Himmelblau's function Level sets versus the gradient Consider a function f whose graph looks like a hill. The blue curves are the level sets; the red curves follow the direction of the gradient. The cautious hiker follows the blue paths; the bold hiker follows the red paths. Note that blue and red paths always cross at right angles. :Theorem: If the function is differentiable, the gradient of at a point is either zero, or perpendicular to the level set of at that point. To understand what this means, imagine that two hikers are at the same location on a mountain. One of them is bold, and he decides to go in the direction where the slope is steepest. The other one is more cautious; he does not want to either climb or descend, choosing a path which will keep him at the same height. In our analogy, the above theorem says that the two hikers will depart in directions perpendicular to each other. A consequence of this theorem (and its proof) is that if is differentiable, a level set is a hypersurface and a manifold outside the critical points of . At a critical point, a level set may be reduced to a point (for example at a local extremum of ) or may have a singularity such as a self-intersection point or a cusp. Sublevel and superlevel sets A set of the form : L_c^-(f) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ (x_1, \\\\cdots, x_n) \\\\, \\\\mid \\\\, f(x_1, \\\\cdots, x_n) \\\\leq c \\\\right\\\\\\\\} is called a sublevel set of f (or, alternatively, a lower level set or trench of f). A strict sublevel set of f is : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ (x_1, \\\\cdots, x_n) \\\\, \\\\mid \\\\, f(x_1, \\\\cdots, x_n) < c \\\\right\\\\\\\\} Similarly : L_c^+(f) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ (x_1, \\\\cdots, x_n) \\\\, \\\\mid \\\\, f(x_1, \\\\cdots, x_n) \\\\geq c \\\\right\\\\\\\\} is called a superlevel set of f. And similarly a strict superlevel set of f is : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ (x_1, \\\\cdots, x_n) \\\\, \\\\mid \\\\, f(x_1, \\\\cdots, x_n) > c \\\\right\\\\\\\\} Sublevel sets are important in minimization theory. The boundness of some non- empty sublevel set and the lower-semicontinuity of the function implies that a function attains its minimum, by Weierstrass's theorem. The convexity of all the sublevel sets characterizes quasiconvex functions.

While Earl of Glamorgan, he was sent by Charles I to negotiate a peace treaty and alliance with the leadership of the Catholic Irish Confederacy. He enjoyed some success, but the agreement quickly broke down. He then joined the Confederates, and was appointed the commander of their Munster Army. In 1655 he published The Century of Inventions, detailing more than 100 inventions, including a device that would have been one of the earliest steam engines.The Century of Inventions, written in 1655; by Edward Somerset, Marquis of Worcester.

Career Edward Somerset was brought up as a Roman Catholic in Monmouthshire. He graduated from Cambridge University, England, in 1627 with a Master of Arts (MA) degree.G. E.

In his day he was one of the richest lords in England, funding his experiments, later self-funding his military endeavours, and sending large amounts of money to King Charles I during the English Civil War. He was a Cavalier who supported the King in Wales, where he raised a regiment of horse for him. His campaigning in the West of England and in Wales, however, did not go well. After a month with his force of over 2,000 troops encamped at Highnam, outside Gloucester, in March 1643 Herbert left them and travelled to meet the king at Oxford. In his absence the entire force surrendered without any exchange of fire, earning it the title \\"The Mushroom Army\\" (they appeared and disappeared very quickly). He was rewarded in 1644, however, with a peerage, being created Earl of Glamorgan and Baron Beaufort of Caldecote.\\"Edward [Somerset], 2nd Marquess of Worcester\\" at cracroftspeerage.co.uk Due to irregularities in the letters patent, these titles were not recognised after the Restoration. Sent to Ireland, he made a false move in concluding a treaty, in great secrecy, on behalf of Charles that was considered to concede too much to the Catholics there; he himself was a Catholic. In extricating himself from that position, he became a close ally of Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, and a potential replacement for James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde as royalist leader. His plans to bring Irish troops over to England were overtaken by events, and he left for France with George Leyburn.Dictionary of National Biography, article under Somerset, Edward. He succeeded his father as Marquess of Worcester in 1646. He was formally banished in 1649, but after four years in Paris returned to England in 1653. He was discovered, charged with high treason and sent to the Tower of London; he was treated leniently by the Council of State, and released on bail in 1654. That year he took up again his interest in engineering and inventions, leasing a house at Vauxhall where his Dutch or German technician Kaspar Kalthoff could work. After the Restoration his estates were restored, but he largely avoided politics, and did not press his claims to the various other titles of nobility. Works In 1655 he authored a book which consisted of textual descriptions of 100 separate inventions.Entitled A century of the names and scantlings of such inventions as at present I can call to mind to have tried and perfected which (my former notes being lost) I have, at the instance of a powerful friend, endeavored now, in the year 1655, to set these down in such a way, as may sufficiently instruct me to put any of them to practice. London : Printed by J. Grismond, 1663. It was eventually printed in 1663 and included a device described as his \\"Water-commanding Engine\\". Constructed from the barrel of a cannon, it was an obvious prototype design for what would later become the steam engine, and clearly anticipated the power and applications of that machine.Dionysius Lardner: The Steam Engine Explained and Illustrated; with an account of its invention and progressive improvements, London, Taylor & Walton 1840 p.23 In 1663 Samuel Sorbi√®re visited Edward's Vauxhall workshop and saw and described the \\"hydraulic machine which the Marquis of Worcester has invented.\\" It was designed for purposes of irrigation, and would \\"raise to the height of forty feet, by the strength of one man and in the space of one minute of time, four large buckets of water.\\" Cosimo de' Medici, Duke of Tuscany, visited it in 1669, when a similar description was given. Robert Hooke, however, described it as \\"one of the perpetual motion fallacies.\\" Edward suggested that when he died, a model of his engine should be buried with him. Almost 200 years later, in 1861, this prompted Victorian collector Bennet Woodcroft to mount an expedition, on behalf of the London Science Museum, to the vault of Raglan church, to try to find a model of the invention in Somerset's tomb.Alexander Armstrong's Who Do You Think You Are at bbc.co.uk Despite opening the coffin lid and searching thoroughly, no model was found. Woodcroft did, however, return with one of Edward's fingernails. Marriage and children He married twice: *Firstly in 1628 to Elizabeth Dormer (died 31 May 1635), daughter of Sir William Dormer and Alice Molyneux, and sister of Robert Dormer, 1st Earl of Carnarvon, by whom he had one son and two daughters: Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort, 3rd Marquess of Worcester, his heir and successor, who was created Duke of Beaufort; Lady Anne Somerset (c. 1631‚Äì1662), who married Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk, and had issue; Lady Elizabeth Somerset (before 16351691), who married William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis, and had issue. *Secondly in 1639 he married Lady Margareta O'Brien (died 26 July 1681), daughter of Henry O'Brien, 5th Earl of Thomond and Mary Brereton, by whom he had one daughter: Lady Mary Somerset, died young.

Newcombe was born Hanna Hammerschlag on Feb. 5, 1922 in Prague. She was the only surviving child of Arthur and Paula Hammerschlag (n√©e Seger); an older brother, Georg, was killed in a tragic kitchen accident when he was a toddler. Her childhood and early adolescence were in Prague. When she was 17, the Nazis marched into Prague, prompting her Jewish parents to emigrate with her to Canada in 1939. Her father was able to obtain a visa through contacts made in the course of his business as an importer of grain. As a Canadian requirement of their immigration, the family managed a fruit farm near Grimsby, Ontario, for several years, moving to Toronto after the Second World War. Newcombe earned a B.Sc from McMaster University in 1945. She met her husband Alan George Newcombe at McMaster, and they then both went on to earn doctorates in chemistry from the University of Toronto. After receiving her PhD in 1950, Newcombe never worked full-time as a chemist, due in large part to the fact that, at that time, married women with children were not expected to work. Daughter Nora was born in 1951 and son George in 1953, both in Toronto, where Alan was working at the Ontario Research Foundation. In 1955, the Newcombes moved to Hamilton, Ontario, where Alan took a job as Director of Research and Development for Porritts & Spencer, a manufacturer of felts for paper making. Son Ian was born in 1956. While raising her three children, Newcombe worked occasionally as an instructor in chemistry. She also took advantage of her knowledge of several languages, including Czech, German and English, to translate scientific articles. In 1962, she briefly tried teaching high school chemistry, but was dismayed by her students' lack of interest in her subject. After meeting Norman Alcock, a physicist who had founded the Canadian Peace Research Institute, Newcombe realized that she had found her calling: the use of science to better understand the path to peace. Alan joined her in working for CPRI shortly thereafter. The Newcombes founded the Peace Research Institute in Dundas, Ontario in the late 1970s. The Canadian Peace Research and Education Association was also their initiative. They founded and published for many years two scholarly journals: Peace Research Abstracts and Peace Research Reviews. They also organized summer institutes on peace research at Grindstone Island, located in the Rideau Lakes, which was a center for peace education managed by the Canadian Friends Service Committee. Hanna was prominent for many decades in the World Federalist Movement, the Canadian Voice of Women, and the Canadian Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). She was also an advocate of mundialization and of twinning. Her writing ranged over many topics, including ruminations on philosophy, religion and the history of science. Hanna Newcombe died in Hamilton in the early morning of April 10, 2011, after a short illness, with her son Ian at her bedside. She was very proud of her three children and of her seven grandchildren: Felice, Claire, Talia, Paul, Andrew, Connor and Eric. Before she died, she knew that she had a great-grandchild on the way, and was thrilled to know that Felice's son (Mason, born in August 2011) would continue the great chain of being.

Lemmink√§inen () or Lemminki () is a prominent figure in Finnish mythology. He is one of the Heroes of the Kalevala, where his character is a composite of several separate heroes of oral poetry. He is usually depicted as young and good-looking, with wavy red hair. Description The original, mythological Lemmink√§inen is a shamanistic figure. In the Kalevala, he has been blended together with epic war-heroes Kaukomieli/Kaukamoinen and Ahti Saarelainen. In one myth, he drowns in the river of Tuonela (the underworld) in trying to capture or kill the black swan that lives there as part of an attempt, as Ilmarinen once made, to win a daughter of Louhi as his wife. In a tale somewhat reminiscent of Isis' search for Osiris, Lemmink√§inen's mother searches heaven and earth to find her son. Finally, she learns of his fate and asks Ilmarinen to fashion her a rake of copper with which to dredge her son's body from the river of Tuonela. Thus equipped, she descends into the underworld in search of her son. On the banks of the river of the underworld, she rakes up first Lemmink√§inen's tunic and shoes, and then, his maimed and broken body. Unrelenting, she continues her work until every piece of Lemmink√§inen's body is recovered. Sewing the parts together and offering prayers to the gods, the mother tries to restore Lemmink√§inen to life, but while she succeeds in remaking his body, his life is still absent. Then, she entreats a bee to ascend to the halls of the over-god Ukko and fetch from there a drop of honey as ointment that would bring Lemmink√§inen back to life. Only with such a potent remedy is the hero finally restored. Lemmink√§inen and the Scandinavian Balder have many things in common in their respective myths (for example, both are killed by a blind man at the feast of gods or heroes), which has led some researchers to believe they share a common origin. Lemmink√§inen in arts Lemmink√§inen is the subject of the four-part \\"Lemmink√§inen Suite\\" by Jean Sibelius, and of an overture by V√§in√∂ Haapalainen, both of them Finnish composers. The 2007 album (Silent Waters) of Finnish metal band Amorphis is about the story of Lemmink√§inen. The 2008 song (River of Tuoni) by Finnish metal band Amberian Dawn is about Lemmink√§inen's mother's search for him in the river of Tuoni. Lemmink√§inen appears as Lemminkal Heikkinen the Warrior-Mage in Mercedes Lackey's 500 Kingdoms Series' homage to S√°mi, among other Scandinavian and northern European myths and legends, The Snow Queen (2008).

Early life and education Born in Campbellford, Ontario, he was the son of Shropshire native Rev. Alfred John Reid (1861‚Äì1957), by his wife Morna Irvine Meredith (1871‚Äì1962), the youngest daughter of Edmund Allen Meredith and a god-daughter of George Irvine. His Meredith grandfather had served as Deputy Under- Secretary of Canada, and Reid later occupied his very same offices at Parliament Hill. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Trinity College, in the University of Toronto in 1927. A Rhodes scholar, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1929 and a Master of Arts degree in 1935 from Christ Church, Oxford. Though academic jobs were scarce in 1930, he had won a Rockefeller Fellowship which enabled him to study the Canadian party and electoral systems in general and Saskatchewan's in particular. At Oxford he had met and married Ruth Herriot, of Winnipeg, and they had three children: Patrick Reid; Morna Reid; and Tim Reid (b. 1936), a Canadian educator, civil servant, and executive. Public life and career Turning down a position to teach at Harvard University, from 1932 to 1938, he was the first full-time National Secretary for the Canadian Institute of International Affairs (CIIA), today known as the Canadian International Council (CIC). He was active in the League for Social Reconstruction, an association of left-wing intellectuals founded in Montreal and Toronto in the winter of 1931‚Äì1932. He also joined the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, the new social-democratic political party that took shape in 1932‚Äì1933. His left-wing views and his conviction that Canada should maintain neutrality in a renewed European war put him at odds with many CIIA members, and essentially made it necessary for him to find a new career path. From 1937 to 1938, he was the acting Professor of Government and Political Science at Dalhousie University. In 1939, he joined the Canadian Foreign Service and held positions in Washington, D.C., London, San Francisco and Ottawa, working on the creation of the United Nations. He was an important member of that extraordinary generation of public servants who helped give Canadian statecraft in the 1940s and 1950s its reputation for excellence. He accompanied Minister of Trade and Commerce James MacKinnon on a tour of Latin America in 1941 which established trade agreements with several nations. From 1946 to 1949 he was Lester B. Pearson's chief aide, and instrumental in devising the idea of a collective security alliance of Western democracies, which culminated in NATO. In 1947, he was appointed Assistant Under-Secretary for External Affairs and was Deputy Under-Secretary from 1948 to 1952. He was a member of the Canadian delegation to the founding conference of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945. From 1952 to 1957, he was the High Commissioner for Canada to India and from 1958 to 1962 he was Ambassador to Germany. From 1962 to 1965, he was Director of the South-Asia and Middle East Department of the World Bank. From 1965 to 1969, he was the first Principal of Glendon College, York University. *Escott Reid, Canadian High Commissioner to India, between Zhou Enlai of China and Indira Gandhi Retirement and legacy Reid spent a large part of his retirement at the farm he and his wife owned at Wakefield, Quebec. From 1973 to 1989 he published seven books, all rooted in his personal experience while dealing with subjects of evident public interest. They included works about the World Bank, the founding of the United Nations, the making of the North Atlantic Treaty, the Hungarian and Suez crises of 1956, his years in India and his friendship with Jawaharlal Nehru, and, finally, his autobiography, 'Radical Mandarin', which is how he referred to himself. Though he was thought by some to have been 'arrogant, given to excess, and a na√Øve liberal idealist', Reid's vital contributions helped to shape some of the 20th century's most important international developments. During his service, Canadian diplomacy was at the forefront of the recognised world leaders, a status that declined rapidly after his departure. In 1971, Reid was made a Companion of the Order of Canada \\"for his services as a diplomat, international public servant and educator\\". In 1993, he received the Pearson Medal of Peace for his work as a public servant. He died in Ottawa on, September 28, 1999.

Farragut North serves downtown Washington and is located just north of Farragut Square. It lies at the heart of the business district on Connecticut Avenue, with two entrances at L Street and one at K Street. Adjacent to the L Street entrance was a food court which has its own stairway to the surface; the food court closed in 2007 and was later replaced with a Results Gym location. It is the third-busiest station in the Metro system, averaging 22,949 passengers per weekday as of May 2017. It is also one of the most shallow, with a lower-than-usual ceiling. Service began on March 27, 1976. The station is named for the adjacent Farragut Square, which takes its name from Admiral David Farragut, the senior officer of the U.S. Navy during the American Civil War. History Farragut North is only a block away (across the square) from Farragut West station; however, there is no direct connection between the two stations. WMATA originally planned to have a single Farragut station that would serve as an alternate transfer station to ease congestion that would develop in Metro Center. However, it would have been constructed using the cut and cover method, disrupting the square above. The National Park Service, which owns the square, would not allow construction which would disrupt the park, so the stations were built separately with no direct passenger connection. Farragut North was one of the original 6 stations to open with the first section of the Red Line on March 27, 1976. It was the western terminus of the Red Line until January 17, 1977, when Dupont Circle opened. In 1992, the station coffer was painted white. On November 24, 2009, a large crack was found in the ceiling during a routine inspection; repairs began the following day. On February 12, 2010 at approximately 10:13 a.m. a train derailed in the pocket track immediately to the north of the station when the front car left the tracks. Of the approximately 345 passengers on board, one person was transported to the hospital. All of the passengers were evacuated without incident. The cause of the derailment was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board. It was found that the train derailed as it was leaving the pocket track due to a derailer, preventing the train from entering the active main tracks and potentially a deadly collision. On Wednesday, November 17, 2010, a chunk of concrete fell from the station roof after street construction work on Connecticut Avenue above the station penetrated the station roof. The station reopened the next day after inspection and emergency repairs. During the majority of 2011, the station had structural repairs. The renovation added a new structural support column, patched cracks in the ceiling where moisture is entering the station, and acoustic ceiling tiles replaced. In addition, the escalators were overhauled. On October 28, 2011, Metro announced its Farragut Crossing program, allowing riders using a SmarTrip card up to 30 minutes to transfer for free by foot between Farragut West and Farragut North stations. On the morning of October 16, 2012, a man was struck and killed by a train after jumping into its path. The death was later ruled a suicide. On January 15, 2018, a 7000-series train derailed on the northbound track between Farragut West and Metro Center because of a cracked track. The response was hampered by poor radio reception for Metro's radios inside the tunnel and minimal cell service due to the depth and the lack of repeaters. In 2019, Metro repaired the station chiller, which had been out of service for almost 4 years. Future improvements As part of its long-term capital improvement plan dated September 12, 2002, Metro has proposed building an underground pedestrian tunnel (similarly to the connection tunnel between Sofia, Bulgaria's Serdika and Serdika-2 metro stations) connecting this station with Farragut West to relieve transfer pressure on Metro Center. This work would also include projects to expand capacity at the station, including more fare gates, extending the mezzanines down the length of the station, more platform-mezzanine connections, and more. Station layout Farragut North station features unique architecture not seen in other stations throughout the system. Its mezzanine stretches across more of the platform and is longer than most, with an open depression looking onto the platform in the middle. There are two elevated mezzanines that serve different escalators and exits. Special buttress-like structures support these stretches of the mezzanine. The low, flat ceiling at the west end was built to accommodate a proposed freeway ramp to Interstate 66, which was never built. South of this station, a non-revenue track diverges from the outbound track that connects with the outbound track on the shared Orange/Blue/Silver Line tracks between Farragut West and McPherson Square. Public art Pulse is a 2013 sculpture by Jefre Manuel, installed at the station's Connecticut Avenue and K Street, NW entrance. It is mounted to the wall at the Connecticut Avenue and K Street, NW entrance. The installation is made of acrylic resin tile. It was funded by the Golden Triangle BID and DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities.

In 1991, Hoskins co-founded the International Study Team, and led a group of international experts to examine the impact of war on the civilian population in Iraq. The study provided a detailed humanitarian assessment of post-Gulf War Iraq. Having seen the impact of war on Iraqi children, Hoskins lobbied the Canadian government to release over 2 million dollars of frozen Iraqi assets held in Canadian banks, and spent the following two years overseeing the purchase and distribution of food and medicine to tens of thousands of at-risk Iraqi children.

He worked with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations in some of the world's worst conflict areas including Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Iraq, Burundi, Afghanistan and Pakistan. As President of War Child Canada, Hoskins was a frequent contributor to Maclean's magazine on war-related issues. He was a regular commentator on CTV, CBC and other major broadcast networks concerning the impact of war on civilians.

Located below the circle of the same name, it is one of the busiest stations in the Metro system, with an average of 16,948 entries each weekday. The station parallels Connecticut Avenue NW between the southern edge of the circle to the south and Q Street NW to the north. The station's southernmost point is slightly more than two-and-a-half blocks north of Farragut North, making the two closer than any other station pairs save Metro Center and Gallery Place. History South entrance escalators Dupont Circle station opened on January 17, 1977, the first to open after the original stretch of the Red Line between Union Station and Farragut North.. It remained the western terminus of the Red Line until December 5, 1981, upon the extension of the line to Van Ness‚ÄìUDC. The south entrance was closed from February 1 to October 21, 2012, to replace all three escalators, deemed among the system's least reliable. In 2007, a portion of Walt Whitman's 1865 poem The Wound Dresser was inscribed into the granite wall around the north entrance escalators to honor the city's caregivers during the HIV crisis. On January 15, 2018, a train headed to Glenmont derailed outside the station. Nobody was seriously hurt. In April 2019, construction began on a station canopy for the north entrance, identical to other canopies across the system. Construction is due to be completed in spring 2020. However, construction was delayed due to the contractor that was supposed to provide the custom glass panels went bankrupt.  Station layout  Dupont Circle station has two tracks with side platforms, one of the only Red Line stations with this setup. This single-bore layout is required by its deep passage beneath the Connecticut Avenue NW underpass and an abandoned streetcar tunnel, now used as an art space. There are two entrances to the station. The north entrance, on the southeast corner of Q Street NW and 20th Street NW contains a set of three escalators and an elevator to reach a mezzanine and fare control at the north end of the station. Unique to the station, the edges of the escalators are trellised with plants where normally there would be granite slabs. The south entrance, located on the southern edge of Dupont Circle at 19th Street NW and Connecticut Avenue NW, has another set of three escalators to reach a separate mezzanine and fare control at the south end of the platforms. The station's north entrance escalators are long. Public Art Walt Whitman poem The beginning of the Walt Whitman poem, \\"Thus in silence in dreams' projections, Returning‚Ä¶\\" from the north entrance escalator. In 2007, a portion of Walt Whitman's 1865 poem The Wound Dresser was inscribed into the granite wall around the north entrance escalators to honor the city's caregivers during the HIV crisis. It reads: Thus in silence in dreams‚Äô projections, Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals; The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand, I sit by the restless all the dark night ‚Äì some are so young; Some suffer so much ‚Äì I recall the experience sweet and sad‚Ä¶ Notable places nearby * Aspen Institute * Brickskeller * Brookings Institution * Carnegie Endowment for International Peace * Dupont Circle * Embassy Row * Emerson Preparatory School * International Temple * Kramerbooks & Afterwords * Middle East Institute * Paul H.

Take Preview Plunge Into Area's Deepest Station\\". The Washington Post. p. B3. With a vertical rise of , the entrance escalators at Woodley Park are the longest in the District of Columbia and the third longest on the Metrorail system (behind Wheaton and Bethesda). The original escalators entered service when the station opened in 1981. On January 5, 2015, work began to replace the escalators, expected to run through mid-2018. History The second of three sets of escalators to reach the platform The station opened on December 5, 1981. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail northwest of the Dupont Circle station and the opening of the Cleveland Park and Van Ness‚ÄìUDC stations. Originally known as simply \\"Zoological Park\\", in 1979 its name was changed to \\"Woodley Park‚ÄìZoo\\" because neighbors believed that the name was misleading, as the National Zoological Park is located from the station. The Adams Morgan neighborhood lies at the other end of the nearby Duke Ellington Bridge, and \\"Adams Morgan\\" was added to the station name in 1999 to reflect this. On November 3, 2011, the station was renamed to \\"Woodley Park\\", with \\"Zoo/Adams Morgan\\" as a subtitle. 2004 accident On November 3, 2004, an out-of- service train rolled backwards into the station and collided with an in- service train. The non-fatal collision injured about 20 people and caused $3.5 million in damages. An investigation determined that the operator of the runaway train was likely asleep. Station layout Woodley Park was the first in the system to deviate from the waffle-like coffers found at most underground stations in downtown Washington, instead using a simpler four- coffer arch. The advantage of the four-coffer arch was that it was pre-cast in Winchester, Virginia, and then hauled underground and installed on-site, while the waffle-style arches used in other stations had to be cast in place. This was done as a cost-saving measure. Access to the station's mezzanine is provided by two sets of three escalators, connected by a short walkway just underneath street level. The entrance is located at the southwest corner of Connecticut Avenue and Woodley Road. An elevator connects to the street with the mezzanine, which contains fare control and access to the island platform.

Origin  The origin of Tokyo Metropolitan University was Prefectural Higher School, under the old system of education, established by Tokyo Prefecture in 1929 as the third public higher school. The School was modeled on Eton College, with three years of advanced course and four years of regular course. The seven-year system had an advantage to assure the entrance to Imperial universities at the age of Middle School, and the typical passway for academic elites before the end of the Pacific War was to enter Tokyo First Middle School, proceeding First Higher School and Tokyo Imperial University. Since the jurisdiction control of Tokyo First Middle School and First Higher School were different, however, Tokyo First Middle School attempted to originally establish the prefectural higher school, whereas the other Middle Schools opposed to the said attempt. Prefectural Higher School was established in 1929 locating in the same site of Tokyo First Middle School, as a result of the opposition. Information Centre In 1932, Prefectural Higher School was relocated to 1‚Äì1‚Äì1 Yakumo, Meguro and became known one if the best higher schools with First Higher School. As the reign of Tokyo Metropolis was enacted in 1943, Prefectural Higher School was renamed to Metropolitan Higher School. After the reform of the educational system in 1949, Tokyo Metropolitan University (former) was established as a research university consisting of three faculties, namely Faculty of Humanities, Faculty of Science and Faculty of Technology; three years of advanced course was reorganised to Senior High School affiliated to Tokyo Metropolitan University, whereas four years of regular course was restructured to Liberal arts college and other faculties. Five Prefectural Colleges, namely Tokyo Prefectural College of Technology, Tokyo Prefectural College of Science, Tokyo Prefectural College of Machine Industry, Tokyo Prefectural College of Chemical Industry and Tokyo Prefectural College of Women were also merged to Tokyo Metropolitan University. In 1957, Faculty of Law and Economics was separated from Faculty of Humanities, and reorganised as Faculty of Law and Faculty of Economics in 1966. As expanding its organisation, the university was relocated to 1‚Äì1‚Äì1 Minami-Osawa, Hachioji in 1991. The university signed the student exchange agreement with University of Vienna in 1997. Tokyo Metropolitan University was reformed in 2005 by integrating three metropolitan universities and one junior college: , , , and , although its English name for the university has not changed since 1949.

As a part of the said administrative and financial reform, social interest grew on restructuring national and public universities to independent administrative agencies with consolidating them. Tokyo Metropolitan University was also planned by Tokyo Metropolitan Government to be consolidated with aforementioned three metropolitan universities and one junior college. Name plate of the university As a result of Tokyo gubernatorial election in April 2003, Shintaro Ishihara was re-elected as Governor of Tokyo, holding up a promise \\"I will establish a revolutionary university\\", and consequently the original restructure plan was significantly and rapidly changed, in terms of the organisation of faculties, course structure, etc. During this process, many faculty staff left the university for making strong protest against the reform.

Located in the neighborhood of the same name in Washington DC, it opened on December 5, 1981. Location The station serves the residential Cleveland Park neighborhood in Northwestern Washington. Its principal attraction is the National Zoological Park; the zoo is not only a downhill walk from this station, but also 106 feet closer from Cleveland Park than from Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan station. Across Porter Street NW lies the Adas Israel Congregation, the District's largest Conservative Jewish synagogue. The historic Art Deco Uptown Theater is located across Ordway Street NW to the south. History While Cleveland Park was part of the initial system plan in 1959, the station opened on December 5, 1981, five years after the first segment began operations. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail northwest of the Dupont Circle station and the opening of Van Ness‚ÄìUDC and Woodley Park stations. From March 26, 2020 until June 28, 2020, this station was closed due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.  Station layout  There are two entrances to the station, both on Connecticut Avenue but on opposite sides of the street between Ordway Street NW and Porter Street NW. Each of these street-level entrances contains an escalator and a staircase leading to an upper mezzanine that joins the two entrances underground. A set of three escalators descends to the station concourse, which houses fare control and ticket machines. An escalator and staircase lead down from the fare gates to the platform. An elevator from street level to the concourse is available on the northeastern corner of the intersection of Connecticut Avenue NW and Ordway Street NW and an elevator is available between the concourse and platform after passing through the fare gates. Cleveland Park station has an island platform with two tracks, A1 and A2. -bound trains use track A1 while -bound trains use track A2. A pair of crossovers north of the station are remnants of its status as the penultimate station of the Red Line from its opening until August 25, 1984, when the Red Line was extended westward once again to (and eventually to Shady Grove). Architecturally, Cleveland Park is similar to other stations along the underground stretch of the Red Line between Woodley Park and Medical Center. Because of the high cost of the waffle design and the relative large depth of these stations, pre-fabricated concrete segments were shipped to the construction site and placed together to form the structure of the station, resulting in a four-coffer station design.

Its boundaries extend approximately from 155th Street and the Macombs Dam Bridge viaduct to 160th Street, between Edgecombe Avenue and the river. A deep escarpment descends 175 feet from Edgecombe Avenue to the river, creating a sheltered area between the bluff and river known as Coogan's Hollow. For 73 years, the hollow was home to the Polo Grounds sports stadium. Namesake The promontory is named for James J. Coogan (1845‚Äì1915), a real estate developer and one-term Manhattan Borough President, who owned the land during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The earliest known published reference to \\"Coogan's Bluff\\" appeared in The New York Times in 1893. Polo Grounds From 1890 until 1963, the bluff overlooked the Polo Grounds, a professional sports venue that served as home field for Major League Baseball's New York Giants from 1891 until the franchise's move to San Francisco at the end of the 1957 season. Sportswriters commonly used Coogan's Bluff as a sobriquet for the Polo Grounds‚Äîas Chavez Ravine now refers to Dodger Stadium and China Basin to Oracle Park‚Äîalthough the ballpark was actually situated in Coogan's Hollow, the bottomland between the bluff and the river. The Bushman Steps, located just west of Coogan's Bluff in Sugar Hill/Hamilton Heights, led from the 155th Street subway station to the Polo Grounds ticket booths; the John T. Brush Stairway, on West 157th Street between St Nicholas Avenue and Edgecombe Avenue, then carried fans the rest of the way down to the stadium.* John T. Brush Stairway at Coogan's Bluff The two stairways are the only intact structures that remain from the Polo Grounds era.

She was awarded the Order of Ontario in 1992. Nancy Pocock was born in Chicago as Anne Dorothy Meek. She was raised in both Illinois and Pennsylvania but by the age of ten has settled with her family in Toronto where she lived until her death in 1998. After graduating from Central Technical School she entered \\"The Grange\\" or the Ontario College of Art to pursue a career in design and jewellery making. In 1930, she studied design and bench work in Paris, and upon returning to Toronto opened a studio on Gerrard Street which she shared with potter and friend Nunzio D'Angelo. Pocock was one of the founding directors of the Metal Arts Guild of Ontario and the only one to be described as a \\"silversmith\\" in its letters patent. Her work was included as part of the craft component for the Canadian Pavilion in the Universal and International Exhibition in Brussels in 1958. Pocock later moved her studio to Yorkville where she worked with her husband Jack (John) Pocock until 1970. They married on 5 March 1942. Being of different religious backgrounds led the Pococks to search for a common religion to fulfil their needs. Nancy and Jack found spiritual fulfilment in the Canadian Society of Friends (the Quakers). Nancy Pocock joined the Peace Movement after Jack returned wounded from the Second World War in 1944. Pocock worked with Jack in planning the Grindstone Island programmes, a series of seminars devoted to tackling the problems of war through peaceful means. She was also a founding member of the Voice of Women and Project Ploughshares and was involved with the Canadian Peace Research Institute, the Canadian Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and a variety of Quaker peace projects including the Canadian Friends Service Committee. She was also a Quaker representative to the Inter- Church Committee on Refugees (ICCR) and Co-ordinator of Toronto Refugee Affairs Council. Pocock committed much of her time to working with refugees during the Vietnam War by helping American draft dodgers and deserters as well as Vietnamese refugees find homes in Canada.

After the death of her husband in 1975, her work with refugees intensified and she expanded her scope of interest to include refugees from Latin and Central America.

Early life Brownstone was born in Winnipeg in 1922 to a poor Jewish socialist family. His parents were Olia Brownstone (n√©e Roseman) and Charles Brownstone. His siblings were Hannah (married to Dr. Norman Hirt), Sam (married to Odette, parents of Justice Harvey Brownstone) and Shieky (married to Ellen). In his youth, he worked in the gold mines of Red Lake, Ontario in order to pay for his schooling. Earlier, he had worked on his uncle's farm where he tried to organize the Ukrainian women working in the field into a trade union, to his uncle's dismay. Government of Saskatchewan From 1947 until 1964 Meyer Brownstone served as a civil servant in the government of Saskatchewan. Involvement with Oxfam Meyer Brownstone became the chair of Oxfam Canada in 1975. For his work with Oxfam Canada, he was the 1986 recipient of the Pearson Medal of Peace. Meyer was Chair Emeritus for Oxfam Canada at the time of his death. Central America Faced with the numerous conflicts in Central America in the 1970s and 1980s, Meyer Brownstone was deeply involved in the region. From 1981-1985, Brownstone participated in several observer missions to the refugee camps of Colomancagua, El Tesoro, Mesa Grande, and La Virtud in Honduras, documenting the life and struggles of the refugees fleeing the Salvadoran Civil War. He was head of a 1985 mission sponsored by Oxfam Canada and the International Committee of Voluntary Agencies to investigate reports of an assault by Honduran troops on the Salvadoran refugees at Colomancagua. In 1986 and 1987 Brownstone participated in two missions to El Salvador, working with the Salvadoran government and the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front. Brownstone also participated in Oxfam Canada missions in Nicaragua during this time. Namibia and South Africa During the dismantling of apartheid in South Africa and the South African administered territory of Namibia (then known as South-West Africa), Meyer Brownstone played a central role in a number of international observer missions. In July 1989, Brownstone was appointed spokesperson/coordinator of the Canadian Council on International Cooperation's mission to Namibia. The primary goal of the mission was to monitor the withdrawal of South African troops following the end of the Namibian War of Independence. A few months later, Brownstone was appointed head of the Canadian mission that oversaw the first Namibian parliamentary election in November 1989. In the lead up to the first South African election following the end of apartheid, Meyer Brownstone participated in two observer missions to South Africa. Brownstone and his team were tasked with increasing voter awareness, enlisting staff for the electoral process, determining the logistics for the election, and monitoring political violence. In 1994, Brownstone was appointed head of the Canadian mission to oversee the election itself. Among the Canadians on the mission were Ed Broadbent, former leader of the federal New Democratic Party, and Flora MacDonald, a former cabinet minister. The electoral mission was tasked with peace monitoring, election monitoring, advising and aiding the Independent Election Commission, and providing coordination with other international missions.

Larousse, 2011) and close personal aide to Napoleon I.Bohn pp 201‚Äì207 Early life Armand de Caulaincourt was the eldest son of Louis Gabriel de Caulaincourt, the Marquis de Caulaincourt, a nobleman and general officer in the army. Born in Caulaincourt, Aisne in the French region of Picardy, he began service in the army at the age of 15, serving as an aide to his father. Military career By the time of the declaration of war in 1792 Caulaincourt had been promoted to captain and was serving as an adjutant on the staff of his uncle, Harville. His lineage as a noble made him suspect by the revolutionaries, causing Caulaincourt to volunteer to serve in the French Garde Nationale in Paris as a common soldier. While on his way to join his regiment he was denounced as an aristocrat and thrown into prison. He escaped prison, and returned to serving in the army. In three years he had regained his previous rank and was serving General Lazare Hoche. He attained the rank of colonel in the Army of the Rhine. By 1801 Caulaincourt had been involved in thirteen campaigns and wounded twice. Diplomatic career Caulaincourt was fluent in a number of languages, including Russian. After the peace of Lun√©ville in 1801 he was sent to Saint Petersburg by First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte. His mission was primarily to check British influence in the Russian court. On his return he was named aide-de-camp of Napoleon. At this juncture an event occurred which was to profoundly affect his life. In 1804 Caulaincourt had been sent by Napoleon across the Rhine to seize some agents of the British government who were in Baden. He was used to pass on orders calling for the seizure and transport to Paris of Louis Antoine de Bourbon, the Duke of Enghien. Once in Paris the Duke of Enghien was tried for treason by a military tribunal and summarily executed. Caulaincourt, an aristocrat, had been used as a means to deliver a fellow aristocrat to his death. When Caulaincourt returned to Paris he learned of the Duke's execution, and wept openly over it. He was incensed that he had been used in this way, and the event forever gave supporters of the Bourbon monarchy a means by which to impugn Caulaincourt's integrity and honor. The shroud of idealism which had earlier colored his view of Napoleon was forever pulled away. From then on, though he treated Napoleon with courtesy, there was always a reserve, and he made a point to be frank in informing the Emperor of what he felt were the true motives behind the Emperor's policies. The event was a point of shame that would haunt Caulaincourt for the rest of his days.Caulaincourt p. xvi After the establishment of the empire he received various honors and in 1808 was given the title of Duke of Vicenza, a duch√© grand-fief. In 1807, Napoleon sent him as ambassador to St. Petersburg, where Caulaincourt endeavored to maintain the alliance of Tilsit between France and Russia. During this time he developed a friendship with the Tsar Alexander I. His tasks as ambassador included attempting to arrange a marriage between Napoleon and one of the sisters of the Tsar. Though nothing came of it, he was able to manage the negotiations without engendering an embarrassing rebuff upon the Emperor. In 1811, with Napoleon preparing to declare a change in policy with Russia, Caulaincourt was sent for to return to France. Napoleon wrote the Tsar to say the Duke was recalled to France because of the Duke's \\"poor state of health.\\"Caulaincourt p. xxi Russian campaign In 1812, Caulaincourt strongly advised Napoleon against his proposed campaign into Russia. He was unsuccessful in dissuading the Emperor. He accompanied Napoleon as Grand √âcuyer, or Master of the Horse, in which he was tasked with maintaining the horses of the Emperor and his close guard, and he had charge of the despatch riders and orderlies. He rode at the Emperor's left side, and was prepared to surrender his horse to him in case there was need. He was with the Emperor at the Battle of Borodino, when Caulaincourt's younger brother, Major-General Auguste-Jean-Gabriel de Caulaincourt, was killed while pressing forward the assault following the capture of the great redoubt. During the French occupation of Moscow that followed, Caulaincourt repeatedly warned the Emperor of the dangers of wintering in Russia. The Emperor wanted to send him to St. Petersburg to negotiate terms of an armistice, but Caulaincourt declined, noting that the Tsar would not negotiate peace terms with the French while they were still in Moscow. During the subsequent French retreat from Moscow, Caulaincourt noted the disintegration of the army, and implored Napoleon to return directly to France to stabilize the political situation in Europe. Napoleon eventually did so, choosing Caulaincourt to travel alongside him in December 1812. Return to France The following month Caulaincourt was assigned the position of Grand Marshal of the Palace and charged with all diplomatic negotiations. He assumed this position following the death of the previous office holder, General Geraud Duroc. Caulaincourt signed the armistice of Pleswitz, June 1813, which suspended hostilities between France and Prussia and Russia for seven weeks. In the following negotiations, he represented France at the congress of Prague in August 1813, and at the Treaty of Fontainebleau on 10 April 1814. The provision for Napoleon on the island of Elba after his abdication is credited to Caulaincourt, who reportedly was able to influence the Tsar Alexander I for this disposition. During the First Restoration of the Bourbons that followed, Caulaincourt lived in obscure retirement. With Napoleon's escape from Elba and his regaining power in France, Caulaincourt was chosen to serve as Napoleon's minister of foreign affairs. Caulaincourt tried to persuade Europe of the emperor's peaceful intentions during the Hundred Days, but he was unsuccessful in this, culminating in the Battle of Waterloo. Following Napoleon's second fall from power Caulaincourt's name was on the list of those proscribed for arrest and execution in what came to be known as the Second White Terror during the Second Restoration of the Bourbons. His name was removed from the list by the personal intervention of the Tsar Alexander I. Later life West pillar of the Arc de Triomphe. Caulaincourt's name is listed sixth from the top. Caulaincourt lived in retirement in Paris. Of the politicians of the First Empire, he was one of the most loyal and faithful to Napoleon.Count de Las Cases, Memorial de Sainte H√©l√®ne Vol VII: Quote from Napoleon: \\"Hugues-Bernard Maret and Caulaincourt, two men of heart and uprightness.\\" Caulaincourt's name is engraved on the Arc de Triomphe's West pillar, and a street in Paris is named Rue Caulaincourt in his honor. His eldest son served as a senator during the rule of Napoleon III. Caulaincourt died in Paris in 1827 at the age of 53, following an illness with cancer of the stomach. Memoir Caulaincourt had kept copious notes on his conversations with the Emperor Napoleon. In the 1820s a number of memoirs of the First Empire were published, written by individuals who had served with Napoleon. These seemed to rely on the retelling of events by Hugues-Bernard Maret, Duke of Bassano, who had served as a personal secretary of Napoleon. Caulaincourt believed these badly misrepresented conversations, individuals and events. In response Caulaincourt wrote his own memoir using his notes as reference. The work consisted of two independent parts. The first work records the discussions between the author and Napoleon just prior to the campaign in Russia, the events of the campaign, the occupation of Moscow, the fire that destroyed the city and the retreat that destroyed the Grande Arm√©e. Following this is a recitation of Napoleon's analysis of events and the world situation as told to the author in the course of their journey to Paris. The second part of the memoir covered the period of 1813 through Napoleon's first abdication, and was still being worked upon at the time of the author's death.Caulaincourt p. xxiv The publication of Caulaincourt's memoir was delayed for a variety of reasons, and the work was eventually lost. Following the First World War the work was rediscovered, and efforts were made to prepare it for publication. After several years of work the entire memoir was published by Jean Hanoteau in 1933 with the title With Napoleon in Russia. The work developed new found significance with the events of the Second World War. Following the initial astonishing success of the German invasion of Russia in June 1941, military historian and theorist B. H. Liddell Hart coolly appraised the difficulties awaiting the Wehrmacht, citing Caulaincourt's work extensively in an article he published in the British magazine The Strand in October 1941. After the war, it was learned that Caulaincourt's With Napoleon in Russia was read with great interest by many German officers during their invasion of Russia. Friedrich von Mellenthin made reference to it in his memoir while describing the character of the Russian soldier, his stubbornness in defense, and his capacity to endure bombardments. General G√ºnther von Kluge, commander of Army Group Center, reportedly often referred to the work. Liddell-Hart interviewed a great many German commanders after the war, and though Kluge did not survive he states General G√ºnther Blumentritt recounted: \\"I can still see von Kluge trudging through the mud from his sleeping quarters to his office, and standing there before the map with Caulaincourt's book in his hand. That went on day after day.\\"  References  Sources * Bohn, H.G.

Retrieved 18 November 2007. is an Australian Liberal Party politician serving as Minister for Home Affairs since 2017, and has served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Dickson since November 2001. Dutton served as Minister for Health and Sport from 2013 to 2014, and Minister for Immigration from 2014 to 2017 in the Abbott and Turnbull Government. On 18 July 2017, he was named Minister for Home Affairs and officially appointed on 20 December 2017 to lead the Department of Home Affairs, a newly created portfolio giving him oversight of ASIO, the AFP and Border Force. He previously served as Minister for Workforce Participation and Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer in the Howard Government. In the first August 2018 spill he challenged Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull for the leadership of the Liberal Party, but was defeated by 48 votes to 35. In the aftermath of the spill, Dutton announced his resignation from the Second Turnbull Ministry and rejected an invitation from Turnbull to remain in the Cabinet. In the second leadership contest, Dutton was defeated by Treasurer and acting Home Affairs Minister Scott Morrison by 45 votes to 40. Following the appointment of Morrison as the new Prime Minister on 24 August, Dutton was re-appointed Home Affairs Minister in the Morrison Government, but relinquished his duties and responsibilities for immigration and border protection. Early years Dutton was born in the northern Brisbane suburb of Boondall, the eldest of five children, with one brother and three sisters. His mother Ailsa Leitch worked in childcare and his father Bruce Dutton was a builder. Dutton finished high school at the Anglican St Paul's School, Bald Hills. Dutton joined the Young Liberals in 1988. He became the policy vice-chair of the Bayside Young Liberals the following year and chair of the branch in 1990. At the 1989 Queensland state election, the 19-year-old Dutton ran unsuccessfully as the Liberal candidate against Tom Burns (former state ALP leader) in the safe Labor seat of Lytton. Dutton graduated from the Queensland Police Academy in 1990. He was a Queensland Police officer for nine years, working in the Drug Squad in Brisbane in the early 1990s. He also worked in the Sex Offenders Squad and the National Crime Authority. As a second job, he worked with his father in a building business. In 1999, Dutton left the Queensland Police. Allegations were made that his departure was due to an incident of 'misconduct'. Documentation filed in the District Court of Queensland in 2000 describes Dutton's resignation as being prompted by a loss of driving confidence resulting from an incident on 4 August 1998. Dutton was driving an unmarked Mazda 626 during a covert surveillance operation. Dutton rolled his car while in pursuit of an escaped prisoner who was driving erratically. Dutton also suffered numerous physical injuries during the accident, was hospitalised briefly and bedridden for a week. Dutton had sought damages of $250,000 from the escaped prisoner's insurance company but dropped the claim in 2005. He went on to become a businessman, completing a Bachelor of Business at the Queensland University of Technology. He and his father founded the business Dutton Holdings, which was registered in 2000; it operated under six different trading and business names. The company bought, renovated, and converted buildings into childcare centres, and in 2002 it sold three childcare centres to the now defunct ABC Learning. ABC Learning continued to pay rent to Dutton Holdings for a commercial lease until at least 2007. Dutton Holdings continues to trade under the name Dutton Building & Development. Howard Government (2001‚Äì07) Dutton with Indian finance minister P. Chidambaram at the 2006 Asian Development Bank board of governors AGM in Hyderabad Dutton was elected to the Division of Dickson at the 2001 election, defeating Labor's Cheryl Kernot. He was elevated to the ministry after the 2004 election as Minister for Workforce Participation, a position he held until January 2006. He was then appointed Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue. He successfully retained Dickson at the 2007 election, which saw the government lose office. However, his margin was reduced to just 217 votes more than Labor's Fiona McNamara. Opposition (2007‚Äì13) Following the 2007 election, Dutton was promoted to shadow cabinet by the new Liberal leader Brendan Nelson, as Shadow Minister for Finance, Competition Policy and Deregulation. In 2008, he chose not to be present in the chamber during the apology to the Stolen Generations, which enjoyed bipartisan support. He said \\"I regarded it as something which was not going to deliver tangible outcomes to kids who are being raped and tortured in communities in the 21st century.\\" Later, in a 2014 interview with the Sydney Morning Herald, Dutton said he regretted boycotting the apology: \\"I underestimated the symbolic and cultural significance of it.\\" In September 2008, Nelson was replaced as Liberal leader by Malcolm Turnbull, who appointed Dutton as Shadow Minister for Health and Ageing. He retained that position when Tony Abbott succeeded Turnbull as leader in December 2009. In June 2010, Dutton released the Coalition's mental health policy. The Australian described it as \\"the most significant announcement by any political party in relation to a targeted, evidence-based investment in mental health\\", but not all experts agreed. Dutton retained his seat with a positive swing at the 2010 federal election, despite an unfavourable redistribution. In the lead-up to the 2013 federal election, he announced a range of Coalition health policies, which were received favourably by industry groups. The Australian Medical Association said \\"the Coalition has delivered a strong package of practical, affordable health policies that would strengthen general practice\\", while Cancer Council Australia said that \\"Dutton's promise to finalise the bowel cancer screening program by 2020 would save an additional 35,000 lives over the next 40 years.\\" Attempted seat shift As the 2010 election approached, it looked like Dutton would lose to the Labor candidate due to a redistribution of division boundaries that had erased his majority and made Dickson notionally Labor. To safeguard himself, Dutton sought pre-selection for the merged Liberal National Party in the safe Liberal seat of McPherson on the Gold Coast (despite not living in or near McPherson). Some constituents complained, \\"The abandoning of a seat by a sitting MP halfway through a parliamentary term to contest pre-selection in a seat over 100 kilometres to the south is not looked upon favourably.\\" Dutton lost the McPherson pre- selection to Karen Andrews, reportedly due to misgivings from former Nationals in the area. He then asked the LNP to \\"deliver him a seat for which he doesn't have to fight other preselection candidates.\\" Liberal MP Alex Somlyay (the chief Opposition whip of the time) said that Dutton's expectation of an uncontested preselection was \\"unusual.\\" When the state executive didn't provide Dutton an unchallenged preselection, Dutton reluctantly returned to campaign for the seat of Dickson. Cabinet minister (2013‚Äìpresent)  Minister for Health  Dutton retained his seat at the 2013 election. He was appointed to the Ministry by then Prime Minister Tony Abbott, and served as Minister for Health and Minister for Sport. As Health Minister, Dutton announced the world-leading $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund. As announced, the capital and any ongoing capital gains of the Medical Research Future Fund will be preserved in perpetuity. Under Minister Dutton, projected funding in the health portfolio increased in the 2014‚Äì15 Budget to $66.9 billion, an increase of 7.5 percent from $62.2 billion in 2012‚Äì13, the final full year of the Labor Government. Projected expenditure on Medicare increased over 9.5 percent from $18.5 billion in 2012‚Äì13 under Labor to a projected $20.32 billion in 2014‚Äì15 under Dutton. Funding for public hospital services increased by nearly 14 percent under Dutton in the 2014‚Äì15 Budget to a projected $15.12 billion compared to $13.28 billion in the last full year of the Labor Government in 2012‚Äì13. In a 2015 poll by Australian Doctor magazine, based on votes from over 1,100 doctors, Dutton was voted the worst health minister in the last 35 years by 46 percent of respondents.  Minister for Immigration (2014‚Äì17)  Dutton (left) meeting with EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos in 2016. On 23 December 2014, Dutton was sworn in as the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection after a cabinet reshuffle. In September 2015, Dutton cancelled the visa of anti-abortion activist Troy Newman, over remarks in his 2000 book Their Blood Cries Out. In 2016, News Corp Sunday political editor Samantha Maiden wrote a column critical of Jamie Briggs. Dutton drafted a text message to Briggs describing Maiden as a \\"mad fucking witch\\" but inadvertently sent it to Maiden. Maiden accepted an apology from Dutton. Before the 2016 election Dutton said of refugees \\"many ... won't be numerate or literate in their own language let alone English\\", and \\"These people would be taking Australian jobs\\". Turnbull defended Dutton by stating he is an \\"outstanding Immigration Minister\\". Against a statewide swing against the government of 2.9 points, Dutton's margin fell from 6.7 to 1.6 points, leaving him with a margin of fewer than 3,000 votes against Labor candidate Linda Lavarch.  Sarah Hanson-Young  On 5 June 2015, Dutton denied claims made by Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young that she was spied on during a visit to Nauru. At the same time he called into question her credibility saying \\"I have evidence that Senator Hanson-Young over-states every issue. She gets her facts wrong most of the time. And I just think you need to look at it in the light of experience with Senator Hanson-Young. If she's got evidence, produce it.\\" He also claimed that \\"What Sarah Hanson-Young is about is publicity. She loves the camera and she loves to see her own name in the paper. That's the start and finish of Sarah Hanson-Young.\\" Hanson-Young responded that \\"Peter Dutton can attack and insult me as much as he likes, but nothing will change the fact that my work has revealed systemic child abuse and the rape of young women on Nauru under his watch.\\" The spying claims were later confirmed by the Immigration Department and Wilson Security who carried out the spying operation. Au pair cases Australian citizenship ceremony in 2017. In June 2015, an au pair who was detained at Brisbane Airport made a phone call and had her tourist visa reinstated. In November, in a second case, Dutton granted a visa to another au pair, despite his department warning him that she was at risk of breaching her work conditions on her tourist visa. Dutton indicated that he knew neither tourist. In August 2018, Roman Quaedvlieg indicated that he had personal knowledge of one of the cases, and was seeking to correct Hansard if it did not match his knowledge. A third au pair was granted a visa due to lobbying by AFL chief Gillon McLachlan, she was due to stay with his relative Callum Maclachlan. Dutton's department again warned him there were indications that she was intending to work for Callum's family. A Senate inquiry into two of the cases published a report on 11 September 2018. It recommended \\"that the Senate consider censuring the Minister for Home Affairs (the Hon Peter Dutton MP) ... for failing to observe fairness in making official decisions as required by the Statement of Ministerial Standards.\\"  Rising seas joke  On 11 September 2015, Dutton was overheard on an open microphone, before a community meeting on Syrian refugees, joking about rising sea levels in the Pacific Islands. He said \\"time doesn't mean anything when you're about to have water lapping at your door\\". Dutton initially refused to apologise, saying it was a private conversation, but later apologised. The foreign minister of the Marshall Islands at the time, Tony deBrum, responded by writing the \\"insensitivity knows no bounds in the big polluting island down [south]\\" and the \\"Next time waves are battering my home [and] my kids are scared, I'll ask Peter Dutton to come over, and he is still probably laughing,\\"  Comments on Lebanese immigration  In November 2016, Dutton said it was a mistake by the Malcolm Fraser administration to have admitted Lebanese Muslim immigrants. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Dutton was making a specific point about those charged with terrorism offences. \\"He made it quite clear that he respects and appreciates the contribution that the Lebanese community make in Australia.\\"  Manus Island  On 15 April 2017 shots were fired by the Papua New Guinea defence force into the Manus Island Detention Centre. Dutton responded saying \\"There was difficulty, as I understand it, in the community. There was an alleged incident where three asylum seekers were alleged to be leading a local five-year old boy back toward the facility and there was a lot of angst around that, if you like, within the local PNG community.\\" \\"I think there was concern about why the boy was being led or for what purpose he was being led away back into the regional processing centre. So I think it's fair to say that the mood had elevated quite quickly. I think some of the local residents were quite angry about this particular incident and another alleged sexual assault.\\" However, the regional police commander on Manus Island said a young boy who was 10, not five, had gone to the centre two weeks earlier to ask for food. He said \\"It's a total separate incident altogether\\" The Greens senator Nick McKim said Dutton had been caught telling an outrageous lie. \\"This has disturbing echoes of the children overboard affair lies.\\" On 31 October 2017, the Papuan Government closed down the Manus Island regional processing centre. However, 600 men residing in the processing centre refused to be moved to alternative accommodation in the town of Lorengau and staged a protest. Dutton defended the closure of the processing centre and asserted that the Papuan authorities had given notice of the camp's impending closure in May 2017. He also rejected Australian Greens Senator Nick McKim's report that there was no safe alternative accommodation available as false and claimed McKim was inciting trouble. Following a prolonged standoff with Papuan security forces, the remaining men were evacuated, many forcibly, to new accommodation. Arrangements have been made to resettle an unspecified number of the asylum seekers in the United States. The others will be moved to either a different part of Papua New Guinea or a different country. In mid November 2017, Dutton rejected an offer by the newly-elected New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to resettle 150 asylum seekers from the Manus Island detention centre in New Zealand and warned that it would have repercussions for the two countries' bilateral relations. He also claimed that New Zealand's offer would encourage people smugglers. Dutton also criticised a New Zealand offer to provide $3 million for services for asylum seekers on Manus and Nauru as a \\"waste of money\\" that could be spend elsewhere, such as displaced people in Indonesia. In addition, Dutton criticised Australia's Opposition Leader Bill Shorten's call for Australia to accept the New Zealand offer as an attempt to appease the Labor Left with \\"cheap political stunts and mealy-mouthed words\\".  Minister for Home Affairs (2017‚Äìpresent)  Dutton (second from right) announcing the creation of the new Home Affairs portfolio in July 2017. On 20 December 2017, Dutton was appointed the Minister for Home Affairs with responsibilities of overseeing the Department of Home Affairs which was established on 20 December 2017 by Administrative Arrangement Order. The Home Affairs portfolio is a major re-arrangement of national security, law enforcement, emergency management, transport security, border control, and immigration functions.  South African farm attacks  :Further Information: South African farm attacks#Australia In March 2018 Dutton made calls to treat white South African farmers as refugees, stating that \\"they need help from a civilised country\\". However, his offer was rejected by Afrikaner rights organisation AfriForum, which stated that the future of Afrikaners was in Africa, as well as by the survivalist group the Suidlanders, which took credit for bringing the issue of a purported \\"white genocide\\" to international attention and for Dutton's decision, and was met with \\"regret\\" by the South African foreign ministry. The Australian High Commissioner was subsequently summoned by the South African foreign ministry, which expressed its offence at Dutton's statements, and demanded a \\"full retraction\\". His proposal got support from some of his party's backbenchers and Liberal Democrat Senator David Leyonhjelm with Leyonhjelm later clarifying that he thought that South African farmers should be admitted under existing visa programmes, and could not be regarded as refugees. National Party of Australia MP Andrew Broad warned that the mass migration of South African farmers would result in food shortages in South Africa. Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema encouraged white farmers to take up Dutton's offer. After initially leaving the door open to changes, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop subsequently ruled out any special deals for white South African farmers, emphasising the non-discriminatory nature of Australia's humanitarian visa programme. In a subsequent interview, Dutton vowed to push forward with his plans, saying that his critics were \\"dead to me\\". Later, in April 2018, it emerged that Dutton's department had previously blocked asylum applications by a white farmer, and another white South African woman, with the decisions upheld by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.  Immigration from New Zealand  Dutton (right) at the swearing in of Michael Outram as Commissioner of the Australian Border Force in May 2018. As both Immigration Minister and Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton has defended an amendment to the Migration Act 1958 that facilitates the denial or cancellation of Australian visas for non-citizens on \\"character\\" grounds. This stringent \\"character test\\" also affects non-citizens who have lived most of their lives in Australia or who have families living in the country. Refusal or cancellation of visa on character grounds. New Zealand nationals living in Australia were disproportionately affected by this \\"character test\\" with over 1,300 New Zealanders having been deported from Australia in the period between January 2015 and July 2018. According to a Home Affairs Department report, 620 New Zealanders had their visas cancelled on character grounds in 2017 alone. In July 2017, Dutton's Department of Immigration and Border Protection introduced a special Skilled Independent subclass 189 visa to provide a pathway for New Zealanders holding a Special Category Visa to acquire Australian citizenship. The visa requires NZ nationals to have held a Special Category Visa for five years and to maintain an annual income of $53,900. Between 60,000 and 80,000 New Zealanders residing in Australia are eligible for the Skilled Independent subclass 189 visa. By February 2018, 1,512 skilled independent visas had been issued by late February 2018 with another 7,500 visas still being processed. The Skilled Independent subclass 189 visa was criticised by Australian Greens Senator Nick McKim as a stealth means of favouring \\"English-speaking, white and wealthy\\" migrants. In early July 2018, Dutton ordered the deportation of controversial New Zealand Baptist Pastor Logan Robertson, who had disrupted services at two mosques in Kuraby and Darra in Brisbane. Dutton approved Robertson's visa cancellation on the grounds that he had violated the conditions of his visa, stating that \\"we have a wonderful tradition in our country of freedom of speech, but we're not going to tolerate people going to a place of worship and harassing others.\\" Robertson had early drawn controversy in New Zealand for his homophobic remarks and opposition to same-sex marriage. In mid-July 2018, Dutton's immigration \\"character test\\" became the subject of a controversial Australian Broadcasting Corporation documentary, entitled \\"Don't Call Australia Home\\", focusing on New Zealanders who had been deported from Australia. In response, Dutton issued a tweet defending his deportation policy and claiming that deporting 184 \\"bikies\\" saved Australia A$116 million. In response, the New Zealand Minister of Justice Andrew Little, who also appeared in the documentary, criticised Australia's deportation laws for lacking \\"humanitarian ideals.\\" The documentary's release also coincided with the release of a 17-year-old New Zealand youth from an Australian detention centre, which had caused friction between the two governments. In response, Dutton defended his Government's policy of deporting non-citizen criminals and chastised New Zealand for not contributing enough to assist Australian naval patrols intercepting the \\"people smugglers.\\" In mid-July 2019, Dutton defended Australia's right to deport criminal non-citizens in response to concerns raised by the visiting New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, stating: In response, Professor Patrick Keyzer and Dave Martin of La Trobe University criticized Dutton's pedophilia remarks as misleading and contended that most deportees from Australia had spent most of their lives in Australia and had little ties to New Zealand.  Protests  In October and November 2019, Dutton expressed his views on protesters and police response. He stated that when protesters break the law \\"There needs to be mandatory or minimum sentences imposed... A community expectation is that these people are heavily fined or jailed.\\" He also agreed with an on-air statement made by conservative 2GB radio presenter Ray Hadley that protesters should not receive social security payments. Leader of the Australian Greens Richard Di Natale responded by saying that \\"Peter Dutton doesn‚Äôt know what living in a democracy means\\" and claimed that he's \\"starting to sound more like a dictator than he is an elected politician. Because somebody says something that he doesn‚Äôt like, that he doesn‚Äôt support, he‚Äôs saying we‚Äôre going to strip away income support.‚Äù In November 2019, Dutton said that the States should make protesters pay for the cost of police response to demonstrations. He said of protesters: \\"For many of them they don't even believe in democracy... These people are completely against our way of life. These people can protest peacefully, as many people do, but the disruption that they seek to cause, the disharmony that they seek to sow within our society is unacceptable.\\"  Policing  In December 2019, Dutton announced that airport security measures were to be increased to detect, deter and respond to potential threats to aviation safety. Measures include greater use of canines and the deployment of extra protective services personnel armed with MK18 short-barreled rifles. Dutton appeared in a video alongside police personnel to announce the policy, sparking criticism of the potential use of police for political purposes. In March 2019, the Australian Federal Police Association had claimed that the AFP should be removed from the Department of Home Affairs to preserve its integrity and its ability to carry out investigations without government influence. Association president Angela Smith described it as ‚Äúan embarrassing situation... We look the least independent police force in Australia, surely the other police forces are laughing at us.‚Äù Leadership challenges On 21 August 2018, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called a snap ballot of the leadership of the Liberal Party following several days of feverish leadership speculation, of which Dutton was at the centre. Dutton responded to Turnbull's ballot call by formally challenging for the leadership of the party and won 35 of 83 votes available, 7 short of a majority. Dutton then resigned from the Ministry despite being offered by Turnbull to retain his position of Minister for Home Affairs, and the media speculated that Dutton and his conservative backers in the party were likely to challenge for the leadership again in the near future. Three days later, Dutton called for another leadership spill, and Malcolm Turnbull tendered his resignation to the Governor-General. Dutton was defeated by Treasurer and Acting Home Affairs Minister Scott Morrison by 45 votes to 40. Dutton representing Australia at the 2018 Sub-Regional Meeting on Counter Terrorism in Indonesia Doubts surrounding Dutton's eligibility to be elected to parliament emerged on the grounds of section 44(v) of the Australian Constitution, as the family trust owned by Dutton operated a child care centre that received over $5.6 million in funding from the Commonwealth Government, in a situation similar to Bob Day's case. Although Dutton had received legal advice stating that he was not in breach of section 44(v), Labor had received contrary advice; at Turnbull's request, the Attorney- General referred the matter to the Solicitor-General. On 23 August, Labor attempted to move a motion to refer Dutton's eligibility as an MP to the High Court, in a similar manner to referrals made during the recent parliamentary citizenship crisis. The motion failed by 69 votes to 68. On 24 August, the Solicitor-General advised that in terms of section 44(v) Dutton was \\"not incapable\\" of sitting as an MP, although he added that he had been provided with limited factual information and that, owing to differences of judicial opinion in earlier decisions of the High Court on section 44(v), Dutton's legal position could not be entirely clear without a referral to the High Court. Dutton was reappointed to his former Home Affairs portfolio by Scott Morrison in the Morrison Ministry, however the duty of Immigration was stripped from the role and was assigned to David Coleman. 2019 federal election Dutton was re-elected at the 2019 federal election. The political think tank GetUp! identified Dutton as \\"Australia's most unwanted hard-right politician\\" after surveying more than \\"30,000 members\\". GetUp! mounted a campaign in an attempt to defeat Dutton in Dickson. In response, Dutton said GetUp! was, \\"deceptive\\", \\"undemocratic\\" and \\"unrepresentative\\" and that he would back \\"parliamentary processes to bring the activist group to heel.\\" GetUp! has defended the effectiveness of its campaigning in Dutton's electorate. Political views Dutton is aligned with the right-wing, conservative faction of the Liberal Party. He has been described as a right- wing populist, and is opposed to an Australian republic. In December 2018, Dutton told Sky News that for the prior seventeen years he had regarded \\"parliament as a disadvantage for sitting governments\\". Violence Dutton said that people in Melbourne are scared of going out because of \\"African gang violence\\", leading to him being ridiculed by people who live in Melbourne. Same-sex marriage Dutton opposes same-sex marriage. In March 2017 it was reported in The Sydney Morning Herald that Dutton \\"said privately it was inevitable that same-sex marriage would become law in Australia so it would be better for the Coalition, rather than Labor, to control the process\\". Dutton's actions publicly have been in opposition to same-sex advocates and \\"the forcefulness of Mr Dutton's attack on corporate chief executives last week ‚Äì in which he told them to 'stick to their knitting' ‚Äì has aroused suspicion among some colleagues who believed he was committed to achieving a breakthrough on [same-sex marriage]\\". The following month The Daily Telegraph reported that Dutton was asked by a lesbian for clarification on his position, and he \\"told her he had been clear that he was against same-sex marriage\\". In his political career, Dutton has voted \\"very strongly against same sex marriage\\". However, he voted in favour of the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017, which legalised same-sex marriage; 65 percent of his constituency voted \\"Yes\\" in the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey. In March 2017, 31 CEOs signed a letter to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull calling for a free vote in the Australian Parliament on same-sex marriage. In response to this letter, on 16 March 2017, Dutton said that the CEOs \\"shouldn't shove their views down our throats\\" and that CEOs who were \\"doing the wrong thing\\" should \\"be publicly shamed\\". Dutton repeated his criticism at a speech to the LNP State Council in Queensland on 18 March. Dutton's comments were heavily criticised as an attempt to censor expressions of support for same-sex marriage, with some commenters also accusing him of hypocrisy given his support for changing Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Former New South Wales Premier Kristina Keneally said that according to Dutton, \\"Free speech is great and should be expanded, unless it's an Australian corporate CEO speaking about same-sex marriage. Then they need to shut up.\\" Liberal MPs and ministers Julie Bishop and Simon Birmingham also expressed disagreement with Dutton's comments. On 9 May 2017, a 67-year-old man pushed a pie into the face of Qantas CEO Alan Joyce while Joyce was speaking at a function in Perth. The next day, the assailant confirmed that the attack was to protest against Joyce's support for same-sex marriage. Dutton had singled out Joyce in his criticism of pro-same-sex marriage CEOs, leading some LGBTI advocates to hold him partially responsible for the attack. Dutton condemned the attack on Twitter. Negative gearing Dutton, who owns six properties with his wife, including a shopping centre in Townsville, opposes any changes to negative gearing which currently offers tax breaks to property investors, stating that changing it would harm the economy.  South African farmers  Dutton has been accused of supporting and promoting the white genocide myth. In 2018, he declared that Boers required refugee status in Australia because of \\"the horrific circumstances they face\\" in South Africa. BBC News reported that the Suidlanders group's \\"message of white genocide\\" had \\"resonated\\" with Dutton, prompting him to offer fast-track visas to white South African farmers due to their being \\"persecuted\\", claiming they needed help from a \\"civilised\\" country. Meanwhile, local media contribution from The Greens leader Richard Di Natale labelled the process of bringing white South African farmers to Australia as thoroughly racist. He also labelled it as a policy that would restore the semblance of policy that was not dissimilar to that enacted under the White Australia Policy. Personal life Dutton married his first wife when he was 22 years of age; however, the marriage ended after a few months. His eldest child, a daughter, was born in 2002 to another partner, and splits time between her parents in a shared parenting arrangement. In 2003 Dutton married his second wife, Kirilly (), with whom he has two sons. On 13 March 2020, Dutton announced that he tested positive for COVID-19, becoming one of the first high-profile cases of the pandemic in Australia. Earlier in March 2020, he had travelled to Washington, D.C., where he met with Five Eyes security ministers, US Attorney General William Barr, and Ivanka Trump on 6 March.

A proton magnetometer, also known as a proton precession magnetometer (PPM), uses the principle of Earth's field nuclear magnetic resonance (EFNMR) to measure very small variations in the Earth's magnetic field, allowing ferrous objects on land and at sea to be detected. It is used in land-based archaeology to map the positions of demolished walls and buildings, and at sea to locate wrecked ships, sometimes for recreational diving. PPMs were once widely used in mineral exploration. They have largely been superseded by Overhauser effect magnetometers and alkali vapour (cesium, rubidium, and potassium) or helium magnetometers, which sample faster and are more sensitive.  Principles of operation  A direct current flowing in a solenoid creates a strong magnetic field around a hydrogen-rich fluid (kerosine and decane are popular, and even water can be used), causing some of the protons to align themselves with that field. The current is then interrupted, and as protons realign themselves with the ambient magnetic field, they precess at a frequency that is directly proportional to the magnetic field. This produces a weak rotating magnetic field that is picked up by a (sometimes separate) inductor, amplified electronically, and fed to a digital frequency counter whose output is typically scaled and displayed directly as field strength or output as digital data. The relationship between the frequency of the induced current and the strength of the magnetic field is called the proton gyromagnetic ratio, and is equal to 0.042576 Hz nT‚àí1. Because the precession frequency depends only on atomic constants and the strength of the ambient magnetic field, the accuracy of this type of magnetometer can reach 1 ppm.Dr. Ivan Hrvoic, Ph.D., P.Eng. \\"Requirements for obtaining high accuracy with proton magnetometers\\". GEM Systems Inc., 2010-01-11. The frequency of Earth's field NMR for protons varies between approximately 900 Hz near the equator to 4.2 kHz near the geomagnetic poles. These magnetometers can be moderately sensitive if several tens of watts are available to power the aligning process. If measurements are taken once per second, standard deviations in the readings is in the 0.01 nT to 0.1 nT range, and variations of about 0.1 nT can be detected. For hand/backpack carried units, PPM sample rates are typically limited to less than one sample per second. Measurements are typically taken with the sensor held at fixed locations at approximately 10 meter increments. The main sources of measurement errors are magnetic impurities in the sensor, errors in the measurement of the frequency and ferrous material on the operator and the instruments, as well as rotation of the sensor as a measurement is taken. Portable instruments are also limited by sensor volume (weight) and power consumption. PPMs work in field gradients up to 3,000 nT m‚àí1 which is adequate from most mineral exploration work. For higher gradient tolerance such as mapping banded iron formations and detecting large ferrous objects Overhauser magnetometers can handle 10,000 nT m‚àí1 and Caesium magnetometers can handle 30,000 nT m‚àí1. Proton magnetometer in archaeology In 1958 Glenn A. Black and Eli Lilly, following the work of M. J. Aitken and his associates at the Oxford University (UK) Archaeometric Laboratory, used proton magnetometers to locate and map buried archaeological features, including iron objects in the soil, thermoremanent magnetization of fired clays, and differences in the magnetic susceptibility of disturbed soils. During 1961-1963, they surveyed more than of the Angel Mounds State Historic Site in Indiana and excavated more than to match anomalous magnetometer readings with the archaeological features that produced them. This was the first systematic use of a proton magnetometer for archaeological research in North America. See also *NMR References Further reading * Black, G. A. and Johnston, R.

His mother was Princess Natalia Nikolayevna Meshcherskaya and his father was Count Paul Ignatieff, a close advisor to Tsar Nicholas II serving as his last Minister of Education. In 1918, the year after the Russian Revolution, Count Ignatieff was imprisoned, but his release was negotiated by sympathetic supporters. The family fled to France, and later moved to Canada. George Ignatieff was educated at St Paul's School, London, Lower Canada College, and the University of Trinity College, University of Toronto, before being awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford. Wartime service and postwar diplomacy With the advent of war, Ignatieff joined the Royal Artillery, where he worked in photographic intelligence. In 1940 he joined the Canadian Department of External Affairs. He became personal assistant to the Canadian High Commissioner in London, Vincent Massey,Davies DT, (editor).

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Galway West constituency from 1982 to 1992 and 1997 to 2011. He was a Senator for the Labour Panel from 1993 to 1997. Life before politics Frank Fahey was born in June 1951 in Galway. He was educated at St Mary's College, Our Lady's College and University College Galway. He was a schoolteacher before he entered politics. Ministerial career Fahey was first elected to D√°il √âireann at the February 1982 general election. In 1987, he was appointed Minister of State for Youth and Sport. He lost his D√°il seat at the 1992 general election and was appointed to Seanad √âireann, serving in the 20th Seanad until 1997. Following Fianna F√°il's victory at the 1997 general election, he returned to the D√°il and was appointed Minister of State with special responsibility for Children. In January 2000, he was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. Following the re- election of the incumbent government at the 2002 general election, Fahey was demoted to the post of junior Minister at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He was re-elected at the 2007 general election but not appointed to any ministerial office. He was, however, appointed to head the joint Oireachtas committee on Transport. Controversies Lost at Sea scheme While Minister of State for the Marine and Natural Resources in 2000, Fahey launched the Lost at Sea scheme to compensate fishermen whose vessels had been lost at sea. In 2004, following a complaint from a late applicant (who had been turned down), the Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly recommended to the department that latecomers should be considered, saying that the schemes had a \\"serious defect\\" in having contacted some fishing families and not others. Via a freedom of information request, The Sunday Business Post found that Fahey had discussed the scheme with two constituents, who later received three quarters (around ‚Ç¨2m) of the overall compensation, prior to the announcement - and had written to them about their successful applications prior to the closing date. In 2007, the Standards in Public Office Commission found no problems with Fahey's conduct. In 2009, the Ombudsman published a full report into the scheme, again recommending that late applicants receive compensation, but it was blocked from discussion in the Oireachtas by the government. Corrib gas project In 2000, one of Fahey's last acts as Minister of State for the Marine and Natural Resources was to approve the foreshore licence for the controversial Corrib gas project. In 2002, in connection with this project, he approved the sale of a large area of Irish national forestry at Bellanaboy to Shell Oil for the building of a gas processing site, which caused much controversy. Investments and property The Irish Times reported in 2006 that in 1994, when Fahey was a Senator, he became involved in establishing a hair and beauty salon business in Moscow, involving an investment of over ¬£200,000 (‚Ç¨254,000). Fahey did not officially declare the interest and at first denied involvement with the salon. Later, he admitted a connection, saying he had travelled to Moscow \\"as an ordinary citizen to support the investors including my wife who were attempting to set up a hair salon there...the whole thing was part of a regional political campaign by a number of individuals to do damage to my integrity, character and good name\\". Fahey has invested in properties in countries including Ireland, France, the US, Dubai and Belgium. He also declared an interest in a construction company and a share portfolio in the D√°il Register of Members Interests. In June 2009, Government minister Trevor Sargent accused Fahey in the D√°il of tax avoidance and making inappropriate decisions as a minister, and called on the Taoiseach to sack him. Loss of seat The 2011 general election was disastrous for Fianna F√°il and Fahey lost his seat, his first preference vote declining to 5.7%. He had said in November 2010: \\"I have no illusions that I will lose my seat\\". During a public meeting in the run up to the election he and government advisor Alan Aherne were booed and heckled.

Biography Born in Roberval, Quebec, the son of Georges L√©vesque and Laura Richard, he was ordained into the priesthood in 1928. He studied philosophy and theology at the Dominican College in Ottawa (Canada) and social sciences at the School of Social sciences of the Universit√© Catholique de Lille (France). He was a professor at the faculty of Social sciences of Universit√© de Montr√©al from 1935 until 1938 and a professor of social philosophy at Laval University from 1936 until 1962. In 1938, he founded the School of Social, Political and Economic Sciences of Laval University and was its first director from 1938 until 1943. The School became the Faculty of Social Sciences in 1943, and he was its first dean, from 1943 until 1955. Notre fondateur, le p√®re Georges-Henri L√©vesque, facult√© des sciences sociales, universit√© Laval He founded the Quebec Superior Council of Cooperation and was its first president, from 1939 until 1944. He founded the periodical Ensemble! and was its director, from 1939 until 1944. He was member of the Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences in Canada (1949‚Äì1951). He was vice-president of the Canada Council for the Arts (1957‚Äì1962). He represented Canada at several international events. In 1963, he founded the National University of Rwanda and he was its first President, from 1963 until 1971. L√©vesque supported the co-operative movement and, through his Faculty, helped create new social welfare bodies such as the Conseil sup√©rieur de la coop√©ration and the Soci√©t√© d'√©ducation des adultes, and to modernize Qu√©bec's church-controlled social welfare organizations. As well, his Faculty of Social Science trained a generation of union organizers. His liberal and social democratic ideas and work brought him into constant conflict with the government of Premier Maurice Duplessis and he is seen as one of the fathers of the Quiet Revolution that transformed Quebec society after Duplessis's death. In 1955, Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent approached L√©vesque about naming him to the Senate of Canada as a non-partisan appointee. L√©vesque agreed and the Dominican Order gave its permission but the appointment was vetoed by Archbishop Maurice Roy due to concerns that allowing a priest to accept a political appointment could potentially embarrass the Church.

It was designed in 1945 and made its maiden flight in 1949. It was originally designed as a bomber for the United States Army Air Forces under specification V-8237-1 and was designated XA-45. The \\"A\\" ground-attack classification was eliminated the next year, and the XB-51 designation was assigned instead. The requirement was for low-level bombing and close support. The XB-51 lost out in evaluation to the English Electric Canberra which - built by Martin - entered service as the Martin B-57 Canberra. Design and development Martin's two XB-51 prototypes, seen low over the runway on a high-speed pass This unorthodox design, first flying on 28 October 1949, was fitted with three General Electric J47 engines - an unusual number for a combat aircraft - two underneath the forward fuselage in pods, and one at the extreme tail with the intake at the base of the tailfin. The innovative, variable incidence wings, swept at 35¬∞ and with 6¬∞ anhedral, were equipped with leading edge slats and full-width flaps. Spoilers gave most of the roll control and undersized ailerons provided feel for the pilot.The Martin XB-51, Air Force Legends Number 201, Scott Libis, published by Steve Ginter 1998, , p.5 The combination of variable incidence and slotted flaps gave a shorter takeoff run. Four 954 lb (4.24 kN) thrust Rocket-Assisted Take Off (RATO) bottles with a 14-second burn duration could be fitted to the rear fuselage to improve takeoff performance. Spectacular launches were a feature of later test flights.Winchester 2005, p. 144. Testing RATO The main landing gear consisted of dual wheel sets in tandem in the fuselage, similar to the Boeing B-47 Stratojet, with outrigger wheels at the wingtips (originally proved on a modified Martin B-26 Marauder named \\"Middle River Stump Jumper\\"Winchester 2005, p. 144.). The B-51 was a large but aerodynamically \\"clean\\" design which incorporated nearly all major systems internally. The aircraft was fitted with a rotating bomb bay, a Martin trademark; bombs could also be carried externally up to a maximum load of 10,400 lb (4,700 kg), although the specified basic mission required only a 4,000 lb (1,814 kg) bombload.\\"Pivoting Bomb-bay Door Permits Accurate Drops at High-Speeds.\\" Popular Mechanics, February 1954, p. 126. Eight 20 mm cannon mounted in the nose would have been installed in production aircraft. Crew was a pilot under a \\"fighter\\"-type bubble canopy and a Short-range navigation and bombing system (SHORAN) operator/navigator in a compartment located lower than and to the rear of the cockpit (only a small observation window was provided).Winchester 2005, p. 145. Both crew members were provided with a pressurized, air conditioned environment, equipped with upward-firing ejection seats.Winchester 2005, p. 145. The XB-51 was the first Martin aircraft equipped with ejection seats, these being of their own design.Tuttle, Jim. Eject! The Complete History of U.S. Aircraft Escape Systems. St. Paul, Minnesota: MBI Publishing Company, 2002. . Operational history 46-685 on approach, from the archives of the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force In 1950, the United States Air Force issued a new requirement based on early Korean war experience for a night intruder/bomber to replace the Douglas A-26 Invader. The XB-51 was entered, as well as the Avro Canada CF-100 and English Electric Canberra; the XB-51 and Canberra emerged from these as the favorites. Test flights showed the XB-51 to be highly maneuverable at low altitudes and substantially faster than the Canberra and faster than most fighter aircraft of the era. However, the XB-51's endurance was significantly lower than that of the Canberra and this factor was decisive in its cancellation. In addition, a load limiting factor of only 3.67 g (36 m/s2) meant that the general strength of the airframe was relatively low and would prevent tight turns while fully loaded. Additionally, the tandem main gear plus outriggers of the XB-51 were thought unsuitable for the requirement to fly from emergency forward airfields. While the XB-51 was not selected for procurement, it was decided that Martin would build 250 Canberras under license, under the designation B-57. Furthermore, Martin's rotating bomb bay would be incorporated into production variants of the B-57. A \\"Super Canberra\\", incorporating other XB-51 features, such as swept wings and tail-planes, was also proposed. This aircraft ‚Äì although it promised much better speed and performance than the B-57 ‚Äì never reached the prototype stage, mainly because the many changes would have taken too long to implement and test, before it could be put into production. Flights by the XB-51 prototype, 46-685, continued, for general research purposes, following the project's official cancellation by the USAF. A second prototype, 46-686, which first flew in 1950, crashed during low-level aerobatics on 9 May 1952. 46-685 continued to fly, including an appearance in the film Toward the Unknown as the \\"Gilbert XF-120\\" fighter.A few seconds of test flight footage of an XB-51 also appeared in the 1951 Tales of Tomorrow episode \\"Plague From Space\\". Note: Although the XB-51 did not receive an official name, \\"Panther\\" had been suggested by the company. The surviving prototype was en- route to Eglin AFB to shoot additional footage when it crashed during takeoff, following a refueling stop in El Paso, Texas, on 25 March 1956.

Quantities measured in rem are designed to represent the stochastic biological risk of ionizing radiation, which is primarily radiation-induced cancer. These quantities are derived from absorbed dose, which in the CGS system has the unit rad. There is no universally applicable conversion constant from rad to rem; the conversion depends on relative biological effectiveness (RBE). The rem has been defined since 1976 as equal to 0.01 sievert, which is the more commonly used SI unit outside the United States. Earlier definitions going back to 1945 were derived from the roentgen unit, which was named after Wilhelm R√∂ntgen, a German scientist who discovered X-rays. The unit name is misleading, since 1 roentgen actually deposits about 0.96 rem in soft biological tissue, when all weighting factors equal unity. Older units of rem following other definitions are up to 17% smaller than the modern rem. One rem carries with it a 0.05% chance of eventually developing cancer. Doses greater than 100 rem received over a short time period are likely to cause acute radiation syndrome (ARS), possibly leading to death within weeks if left untreated. Note that the quantities that are measured in rem were not designed to be correlated to ARS symptoms. The absorbed dose, measured in rad, is a better indicator of ARS.The Effects of Nuclear Weapons, Revised ed., US DOD 1962 A rem is a large dose of radiation, so the millirem (mrem), which is one thousandth of a rem, is often used for the dosages commonly encountered, such as the amount of radiation received from medical x-rays and background sources. Usage The rem and millirem are CGS units in widest use among the U.S. public, industry, and government. However, the SI unit the sievert (Sv) is the normal unit outside the United States, and is increasingly encountered within the U.S.A. in academic, scientific, and engineering environments. The conventional units for dose rate is mrem/h. Regulatory limits and chronic doses are often given in units of mrem/yr or rem/yr, where they are understood to represent the total amount of radiation allowed (or received) over the entire year. In many occupational scenarios, the hourly dose rate might fluctuate to levels thousands of times higher for a brief period of time, without infringing on the annual total exposure limits. There is no exact conversion from hours to years because of leap years, but approximate conversions are: :1 mrem/h = 8,766 mrem/yr :0.1141 mrem/h = 1,000 mrem/yr The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) once adopted fixed conversion for occupational exposure, although these have not appeared in recent documents: :8 h = 1 day :40 h = 1 week :50 week = 1 yr Therefore, for occupation exposures of that time period, :1 mrem/h = 2,000 mrem/yr :0.5 mrem/h = 1,000 mrem/yr The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) strongly discourages Americans from expressing doses in rem, in favor of recommending the SI unit. The NIST recommends defining the rem in relation to the SI in every document where this unit is used.  Health effects  Ionizing radiation has deterministic and stochastic effects on human health. The deterministic effects that can lead to acute radiation syndrome only occur in the case of high doses (> ~10 rad or > 0.1 Gy) and high dose rates (> ~10 rad/h or > 0.1 Gy/h). A model of deterministic risk would require different weighting factors (not yet established) than are used in the calculation of equivalent and effective dose. To avoid confusion, deterministic effects are normally compared to absorbed dose in units of rad, not rem. Stochastic effects are those that occur randomly, such as radiation- induced cancer. The consensus of the nuclear industry, nuclear regulators, and governments, is that the incidence of cancers caused by ionizing radiation can be modeled as increasing linearly with effective dose at a rate of 0.055% per rem (5.5%/Sv). Individual studies, alternate models, and earlier versions of the industry consensus have produced other risk estimates scattered around this consensus model. There is general agreement that the risk is much higher for infants and fetuses than adults, higher for the middle-aged than for seniors, and higher for women than for men, though there is no quantitative consensus about this. There is much less data, and much more controversy, regarding the possibility of cardiac and teratogenic effects, and the modelling of internal dose. The ICRP recommends limiting artificial irradiation of the public to an average of 100 mrem (1 mSv) of effective dose per year, not including medical and occupational exposures. For comparison, radiation levels inside the United States Capitol are 85 mrem/yr (0.85 mSv/yr), close to the regulatory limit, because of the uranium content of the granite structure. According to the ICRP model, someone who spent 20 years inside the capitol building would have an extra one in a thousand chance of getting cancer, over and above any other existing risk. (20 yr √ó 85 mrem/yr √ó 0.001 rem/mrem √ó 0.055%/rem = ~0.1%) History The concept of the rem first appeared in literature in 1945 and was given its first definition in 1947. The definition was refined in 1950 as \\"that dose of any ionizing radiation which produces a relevant biological effect equal to that produced by one roentgen of high-voltage x-radiation.\\" Using data available at the time, the rem was variously evaluated as 83, 93, or 95 erg/gram. Along with the introduction of the rad in 1953, the ICRP decided to continue the use of the rem. The US National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements noted in 1954 that this effectively implied an increase in the magnitude of the rem to match the rad (100 erg/gram). The ICRP officially adopted the rem as the unit of equivalent dose in 1962 to measure the way different types of radiation distribute energy in tissue and began recommending values of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for various types of radiation. In practice, the unit of rem was used to denote that an RBE factor had been applied to a number which was originally in units of rad or roentgen. The International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) adopted the sievert in 1980 but never accepted the use of the rem. The NIST recognizes that this unit is outside the SI but temporarily accepts its use in the U.S. with the SI. The rem remains in widespread use as an industry standard in the U.S.Handbook of Radiation Effects, 2nd edition, 2002, Andrew Holmes-Siedle and Len Adams The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission still permits the use of the units curie, rad, and rem alongside SI units.

Sutherland is located 30 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district and is the administrative centre for the local government area of the Sutherland Shire. History There are two theories for the origin of the Sutherland name:Sutherland Shire place names, fact sheet by the Sutherland Shire, August 2003 * It is suggested that the name was taken from able seaman Forby Sutherland, who died on Captain Cook's Endeavour voyage. Sutherland Point at Kurnell is named after him, but there's no direct connection of him to the Sutherland Shire district. * Thomas Mitchell as surveyor general in 1835 named the first parish south of the Georges River as the \\"Parish of Southerland\\" (South with an \\"o\\"). But it appeared in a later government gazette spelt Sutherland, losing the significance of the name. Thomas Holt (1811‚Äì88) purchased 13,000 acres (53 km2) in the 1860s that stretched from Sutherland to Cronulla. The Sutherland area was originally heavily timbered and timber-cutting became the first industry. Holt initiated many commercial projects including timber cutting, coal mining, sheep farming and oyster farming. He built a forty-room mansion called Sutherland House in 1881 at Sylvania, on the bank of Gwawley Bay. The mansion was destroyed by fire in 1918, thought to have been deliberately lit.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia The first road through the area was South Road constructed in 1842. Later Illawarra Road was built along the ridges of high land to the Woronora River. The Princes Highway became the main thoroughfare through Sutherland, linking Sydney to the Illawarra region. The railway line was constructed in the 1880s and development followed. Residents lived in humpies or tents in the bush. Once the land was cleared, a township developed around the railway station. In 1886 there were only four permanent buildings: the railway station, the station master's residence, the railway keeper's cottage and a general store run by a man called Bramley. The post office opened on 1 September 1886 and a school began classes in 1887. In 1906, the shire of Sutherland was proclaimed and the name Sutherland was officially declared. The first meetings were held in the shire clerk's home and the Council Chambers were built in 1915.http://www.sutherland.nsw.gov.au/ssc/rwpattach.nsf/0/Factsheet_6_FINAL_20030728.pdf/$file/Factsheet_6_FINAL_20030728.pdf By the 1920s, steam trams operated between Cronulla and Sutherland. Woronora Memorial Park In 1897, land was set aside west of Sutherland station for a denominational cemetery, as an alternative to a site at Kurnell, which would have required a long branch line. A single track line long was constructed next to the station and opened on 13 June 1900.Forsyth, J.H. (ed.) (1988‚Äì93), Stations & Tracks; Vol. 1: \\"Main Suburban & Branches ‚Äì Illawarra & Branches\\". State Rail Authority of New South Wales: Sydney, p. 125. A single platform long and a loop for engines were included. The first funeral had taken place earlier that year, with the casket arriving by train from Mortuary station in the city. However, due to the advent of the motor car and motorised funerals, funerals by train eventually fell out of favour, with the result that the line closed on 23 May 1947, with no funeral having taken place for some years beforehand. The line and platform were subsequently demolished and removed; no remains, apart from the original formation coming from the main line, are visible today.Neve, Peter (1997), \\"Railways (and tramways) in the Sutherland Shire\\": (Sutherland Shire Studies No. 6) , Sutherland Shire Council. Retrieved 4 March 2013. Commercial area Sutherland is a mostly residential area with a shopping centre located close to Sutherland station. Some commercial developments are also located on the Princes Highway. As the administrative centre of the Sutherland Shire, Sutherland hosts facilities such as a general purpose entertainment centre where citizenship ceremonies take place, a community centre, local government council offices and Sutherland Library, a major central library. Woronora Cemetery sits on the western border of the suburb. Stapleton's butchery closed in 2017. It had opened in Sutherland in 1896. Transport Sutherland station is a junction on the Illawarra line of the Sydney Trains network. The main line runs south to Waterfall and Wollongong and north to Bondi Junction, and a branch line runs east to Cronulla. For details of bus services see Sutherland Station When the Southern Freeway (also known as the F6) was built linking Sydney to Wollongong, the Princes Highway was diverted away from the centre of Sutherland using Acacia Road. An F6 extension has been proposed for many years, which would link Sutherland to the Captain Cook Bridge via Miranda and onto the Southern Cross Drive via Brighton-Le-Sands.

Burns, Royal Military College of Canada cadet E.L.M. Burns was born on June 17, 1897 in Montreal, Quebec. His father was a militia staff officer, a member of the Corps of Guides. He served with the 17th Duke of York's Royal Canadian Hussars (17th D.Y.R.C.H.). He had risen to the rank of signal sergeant by 1913.Military Oral History collection \\"Tommy\\" Burns, student # 1032 graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario in 1914. He joined the Royal Canadian Engineers, into which he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1915. World War I Burns served in Canada until March 1916 when he went overseas with the 3rd Canadian Division Signal Company which, was composed of engineers. He fought on the Western Front with the Royal Canadian Engineers from 1916 to 1918. He became a staff officer with the 9th Brigade in March 1917, dealing with supply and personnel. He became a \\"staff learner\\" and acted as liaison officer between forward battalions and brigade headquarters. He returned to Canada in 1919 and was stationed at St. John as an engineer officer. Between the wars Burns attended the School of Military Engineering, Chatham, England, for eighteen months. He was an instructor at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. He returned to Halifax and served on duty during the miners' strike at Glace Bay. He worked in the Survey Department in Ottawa. In 1924, he was appointed as an instructor at RMC in field engineering. He attended the Staff College, Quetta, British India and returned to Quebec, Canada in 1930. In 1939, as a lieutenant colonel, he attended the Imperial Defence College in London, England. World War II During World War II Burns successively commanded the 4th Canadian Armoured Brigade, the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, the 5th Canadian (Armoured) Division (January 1944 to March 1944), and then finally I Canadian Corps (March 1944 until November 1944). His performance as a corps-level commander proved to be controversial, despite the successes of the Canadian forces in the Italian Campaign, and so he was replaced as commander of I Canadian Corps by Lieutenant-General Charles Foulkes. Later life Burns served as Deputy Minister of Veterans‚Äô Affairs. He served as a President of the UNAC during the 1950s. He played a critical role in the Middle East peace process from 1954 to 1959.

He then led UNEF as Force Commander from November 1956 to December 1959. He was Canada's principal disarmament negotiator from 1960‚Äì68. Burns held the chair of Strategic Studies at the Norman Paterson School for International Affairs, Carleton University from 1969‚Äì75.

It is located on the southern shore of Sydney Harbour, immediately north-west of the Sydney central business district. Boundaries The formal boundaries of the suburb named \\"The Rocks\\" cover the western side of Sydney Cove (Circular Quay) east of the Sydney Harbour Bridge approaches. In the north it extends to the southern base of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, in the east to the shoreline of Circular Quay and George Street, in the south to Jamison Street (thus including the area known as \\"Church Hill\\"), and in the west to southern approaches of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Western Distributor overpass.Detailed Suburb Report for The RocksThe Rocks - Millers Point - Dawes Point History A dwelling in an unidentified street at The Rocks, 1910s. George and Harrington Streets, 1907 The Rocks became established shortly after the colony's formation in 1788. It was known as Tallawoladah by the Cadigal people. The original buildings were first traditional vernacular houses, of wattle and daub, with thatched roofs, and later of local sandstone, from which the area derives its name. From the earliest history of the settlement, the area had a reputation as a slum and the arriving convicts' side of town, often frequented by visiting sailors and prostitutes. After November 1790, many of the inhabitants were also aboriginals. In 1823, the district had a population of about 1,200. During the late nineteenth century, the area was dominated by a gang known as the Rocks Push. It maintained this rough reputation until approximately the 1870s. By the early 20th century, many of the area's historic buildings were in serious decay. In 1900, bubonic plague broke out, and the state government resumed areas around The Rocks and Darling Harbour, with the intention of demolishing them and rebuilding them. More than 3,800 houses, buildings and wharves were inspected and hundreds demolished, but the continuation of these plans were brought to a halt due to the outbreak of World War I.How plague almost demolished historic Sydney, Australian Geographic, 16 August 2010. During the 1920s, several hundred buildings were demolished during the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Campbell's Cove ASN Co building, Hickson Road Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority, with the intention of demolishing most of the original buildings, re-developing them as high-density residential dwellings. In February 1971, a group of local residents formed the Rocks Residents Group to oppose the plans. They felt that the new dwellings would result in increased rents, which would force out the traditional residents of the area. The residents' group requested a green ban from the Builder's Labourers Federation, who had become increasingly active in preventing controversial developments over the previous four years. SIRIUS apartments, a residential public housing development By 1973, the union had imposed the ban, and after discussions with the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority, a 'People's Plan' was developed. By October 1973, it appeared that the redevelopment would proceed as originally planned, using non-union labour. For two weeks, demonstrations by local residents and unionists followed, with numerous arrests being made. Liberal Premier Robert Askin was in the midst of an election campaign, and used the protests as a means of conveying his law and order message to voters. However, the green ban stayed in place until 1975 when the state union leadership was overthrown and was ultimately successful, as can be seen in the buildings that survive today. Instead of demolishing The Rocks, renovations transformed the area into a commercial and tourist precinct. Today the Rocks is a partly gentrified area, but still contains a significant proportion of Housing Commission properties, and there is still a significant problem of urban poverty and street crime in this district. As housing stock becomes dilapidated, government policy is to sell the now extremely valuable public housing units to private owners, in the expectation that they will restore the properties. The Sirius building and the associated \\"Save Our Sirius\\" protest group was formed to protest relocation of its residents.  Church Hill  \\"Church Hill\\" is located in the southern part of The Rocks, sometimes identified as the northern part of the Sydney central business district. It is so named because the earliest churches in Australia were formed on this site, including St Patrick's (Roman Catholic), St Philip's (Anglican) and Scots Church (Presbyterian) The significance of Church Hill dates back to the time of Governor Arthur Phillip, who mandated compulsory Sunday church attendance for all convicts, until they rebelled and burned down the area‚Äôs first church in 1798. The area gained greater prominence as Church Hill on Wednesday 1 October 1800, when incoming Governor Philip Gidley King had the foundation stone laid for St Philip‚Äôs Church, which subsequently he proclaimed one of Australia‚Äôs first two parishes in 1802 (the other being St John‚Äôs in Parramatta). The site where St Patrick‚Äôs Church currently stands is where the Roman Catholic Eucharist was first preserved in Australia, in May 1818. Celebrations for the bicentenary of this occasion were held in St Patrick‚Äôs Church on Sunday 6 May 2018.

It was the usual Parisian residence of most French monarchs, from Henry IV to Napoleon III, until it was burned by the Paris Commune in 1871. Built in 1564, it was gradually extended until it closed off the western end of the Louvre courtyard and displayed an immense fa√ßade of 266 metres. Since the destruction of the Tuileries, the Louvre courtyard has remained open and the site is now the location of the eastern end of the Tuileries Garden, forming an elevated terrace between the Place du Carrousel and the gardens proper. History The Tuileries Palace in the 1600s The old medieval Louvre (background) and the Tuileries (foreground) linked by the Grande Galerie along the River Seine, in 1615 The Tuileries Palace and the Louvre on the 1739 Turgot map of Paris, during the reign of Louis XV The Tuileries Palace (white) was located at the west end of the modern Louvre, closing off the Louvre courtyard After the accidental death of Henry II of France in 1559, his widow Catherine de' Medici (1519‚Äì1589) planned a new palace. She sold the medieval H√¥tel des Tournelles, where her husband had died, and began building the palace of Tuileries in 1564, using architect Philibert de l'Orme. The name derives from the tile kilns or tuileries which had previously occupied the site. The palace was formed by a range of long, narrow buildings. During the reign of Henry IV (1589‚Äì1610), the building was enlarged to the south, so it joined the long riverside gallery, the Grande Galerie, which ran all the way to the older Louvre Palace in the east. Louis XIV During the reign of Louis XIV, major changes were made to the Tuileries Palace. From 1659 to 1661 it was extended to the north by the addition of the Th√©√¢tre des Tuileries.Coeyman 1998, pp. 45‚Äì46. From 1664 to 1666 the architect Louis Le Vau and his assistant Fran√ßois d'Orbay made other significant changes. They transformed Philibert de l'Orme's facades and central pavilion, replacing its grand central staircase with a colonnaded vestibule on the ground floor and the Salle des Cents Suisses (Hall of the Hundred Swiss Guards) on the floor above and adding a rectangular dome. A new grand staircase was installed in the entrance of the north wing of the palace, and lavishly decorated royal apartments were constructed in the south wing. The king's rooms were on the ground floor, facing toward the Louvre, and the queen's on the floor above, overlooking the garden. At the same time, Louis' gardener, Andr√© Le N√¥tre, redesigned the Tuileries Garden. The Court moved into the Tuileries Palace in November 1667, but left in 1672, and soon thereafter went to the Palace of Versailles.Hautecoeur 1927, pp. 123‚Äì142; Dev√™che 1981, pp. 9‚Äì13. The Tuileries Palace was virtually abandoned and used only as a theatre, but its gardens became a fashionable resort of Parisians. Louis XV The boy-king Louis XV was moved from Versailles to the Tuileries Palace on 1 January 1716, four months after ascending to the throne. He moved back to Versailles on 15 June 1722, three months before his coronation. Both moves were made at the behest of the Regent, the duc d'Orl√©ans. The king also resided at the Tuileries for short periods during the 1740s.Bernier, Oliver, Louis The Beloved: The Life of Louis XV, Doubleday, Garden City, 1984 pp. 12-39 Louis XVI The storming of the Tuileries Palace on 10 August 1792 and the massacre of the Swiss Guard On 6 October 1789, during the French Revolution, Louis XVI and his family were forced to leave Versailles and brought to the Tuileries where they were kept under surveillance. For the next two years the palace remained the official residence of the king. On 9 November 1789, the National Constituent Assembly, formerly the Estates-General of 1789, had moved its deliberations from the tennis court at Versailles to the Tuileries, following the removal of the court to Paris. The Tuileries' covered riding ring, the Salle du Man√®ge (which ran along the north end of the Tuileries Garden to the west of the palace), home to the royal equestrian academy, provided the largest indoor space in the city. The royal family tried to escape after dark, on 20 June 1791, but were captured at Varennes and brought back to the Tuileries. The following year, on 10 August 1792, the palace was stormed by an armed mob, which overwhelmed and massacred the Swiss Guard as the royal family fled through the gardens and took refuge with the Legislative Assembly. The Paris National Guard defended the King, but the daughter of King Louis XVI claimed that many of the guard were already in favor of the revolution.O'Leary, Margaret R. \\"Tuileries Palace Attacked, August 10, 1792.\\" Forging Freedom: The Life of Cerf Berr of M√©delsheim. N.p.: n.p., n.d. 344. Print. In November 1792, the Armoire de fer incident took place at the Tuileries Palace. This was the discovery of a hiding place at the royal apartments, believed to contain the secret correspondence of Louis XVI with various political figures. The incident created a considerable scandal that served to discredit the King. Revolutionary France The Tuileries accommodated the Constituent Assembly, its successor, the National Convention and, in 1795, the Council of Five Hundred (Conseil des Cinq-Cents) of the Directoire until the body moved to the Palais-Bourbon in 1798. In 1799, the Jacobin Club du Man√®ge had its headquarters there. The Committee of Public Safety met in the Pavillon de Flore. A courtier of a later era could summon up nightmarish visions of the palace's Salle de Spectacle, or theater, where many Convention sessions were held during the Reign of Terror: Napoleon Military review in front of the Tuileries in 1810, by Hippolyte Bellang√©. The Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, which can be seen on the right of this painting, used to be the entrance gate of the palace of the Tuileries and, with the Pavillon de Flore, is all that remains, above ground, of the palace at the site. When Napoleon Bonaparte came into power in 1799, he made the Tuileries the official residence of the First Consul and, later, the imperial palace. In 1808, Napoleon began constructing the northern gallery which also connected to the Louvre, enclosing a vast square (place). As Napoleon I's chief residence, the Tuileries Palace was redecorated in the Neoclassical Empire style by Percier and Fontaine and some of the best known architects, designers, and furniture makers of the day. In 1809, Jacob-Desmalter, principal supplier of furniture to the Emperor, began work on a jewel cabinet designed for the Empress Jos√©phine's great bedroom in the Tuileries (and soon to be used by Marie- Louise). Designed by the architect Charles Percier, this impressive piece of furniture was embellished with several gilt-bronze ornaments: the central panel depicts the \\"Birth of the Queen of the Earth to whom Cupids and Goddesses hasten with their Offerings\\" by the bronzier Pierre-Philippe Thomire, after a bas-relief by Chaudet. Jacob-Desmalter completed the \\"great jewelry box\\" in 1812, with two smaller items of furniture in the same style but using woods from rainforests in China. After Napol√©on's divorce, Pierre Paul Prud'hon was commissioned to design the apartments of his new wife, Marie-Louise. For the bridal suite of the new Empress he designed all the furniture and interior decorations in a Greek Revival style. Restoration The Tuileries Palace became the royal residence at the time of the Bourbon Restoration from 1814 to 1830. During the July Revolution of 1830, the palace was attacked for a third time by an armed mob and occupied. The Swiss Guards stationed at the palace, aware of what had happened in 1792 to their predecessors, abandoned the palace. King Louis Philippe I took up permanent residence there until 1848, when it was again invaded on 24 February. After the coup d'√©tat by Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte in 1852, the Tuileries Palace served as the official residence of the executive branch of government, and when President Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte became Emperor Napol√©on III, he moved from his office at the √âlys√©e Palace to the Tuileries. The Second Empire Gala soir√©e, of 10 June 1867, for foreign sovereigns attending the International Exposition of that year, by Pierre Tetar van Elven. The exterior horseshoe staircase, from the garden to the Salle de Mar√©chaux, was temporarily erected for the occasion. Empress's salon During the Second Empire, the Tuileries was extensively refurbished and redecorated after the looting and damage that occurred during the Revolution of 1848. Some imposing state rooms were designed and richly decorated, serving as the center stage of the ceremonies and pageantry of the Second Empire, such as on the occasion of Queen Victoria's state visit to France in 1855. The Second Empire also completed the northern wing of the Louvre along the rue de Rivoli, linking the Tuileries Palace with the rest of the Louvre, and thus finally achieving the huge complex of the Louvre-Tuileries, whose master plan had been envisioned three centuries earlier. Previously, the Place du Carrousel had been swept clear of the old houses that had encroached on it. The prominent roof-lines of the palace and especially its squared central dome were influential prototypes in the Second Empire style adopted for hotels and commercial buildings as well as residences in the United Kingdom and North America. Interior The private apartment used by Napoleon III, on the ground floor of the southern wing of the palace, consisted of \\"overheated gilt boxes furnished in the style of the First Empire\\", being kept at \\"an excessively high temperature\\" by the emperor. Empress Eug√©nie had her apartment above, connected to the emperor's by a winding staircase, with a mezzanine occupied by the treasurer of the privy purse in between, and comprising eight of the eleven rooms on the bel etage of the southern wing's garden side. This arrangement at the Tuileries was unlike at Versailles, where the apartments of monarch and consort were both on the same floor and the king's was the grander of the two. The state rooms ‚Äì on the Carrousel, or east, side ‚Äì of the south wing were used variously depending on the occasion. If it were an informal dinner, the household would gather in the Private Drawing Room, or Salon d'Apollon, which was separated from the Salle de Mar√©chaux, in the central pavilion, by the First Consul's Room, or Salon Blanc. The party would proceed through the throne room to dinner in the Salon Louis XIV. However, gala dinners were held in the larger Galerie de Diane, the southernmost of the state apartments. If it were a state ball, then refreshments would be set up in the Galerie; and the procession of the imperial party would be from there to the Salle de Mar√©chaux, which occupied the space of two entire floors of the central Pavillon de L'Horloge and served as the ballroom. The little-used northern wing of the palace, which contained the chapel, Galerie de la Paix, and the Salle de Spectacle would be called into service only for performances, such as the Auber cantata performed the evening of Napoleon and Eug√©nie's civil wedding ceremony, 29 July 1853, or for the most important f√™tes, such as the party given for sovereigns attending the International Exposition, on 10 June 1867. The Salle de Spectacle was also used as a hospital during the Franco- Prussian War. The southernmost pavilion, the Pavillon de Flore, served as the backstairs to the palace. Service corridors led to it. One could get from there to the sprawling basement, lit with innumerable gas lamps, where a railway had been set up to bring food from the kitchens under the Rue de Rivoli. Destruction The finalization of the long planned Louvre-Tuileries complex was not to happen. On 23 May 1871, during the suppression of the Paris Commune, twelve men under the orders of Jules Bergeret, the former chief military commander of the Commune, set the Tuileries on fire at 7 p.m., using petroleum, liquid tar and turpentine. The fire lasted 48 hours and thoroughly gutted the palace, except for the southernmost part, the Pavillon de Flore (the gate of honor, the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, also remains, as well as the foundation). The dome itself was blown up by explosives placed in the central pavilion and detonated by the converging fires. Observing this, Bergeret sent a note to the Committee of Public Safety: 'The last vestiges of Royalty have just disappeared. I wish that the same may befall all the public buildings of Paris''Paris under Siege' by Joanna Richardson publ. Folio Society London 1982 It was only on 25 May that the Paris fire brigades and the 26th battalion of the Chasseurs d'Afrique managed to put out the fire. The library and other portions of the Louvre were also set on fire by Communards and entirely destroyed. The museum itself was only miraculously saved. The ruins of the Tuileries stood on the site for 11 years. Although the roofs and the inside of the palace had been utterly destroyed by the fire, the stone shell of the palace remained intact and restoration was possible. Other monuments of Paris also set on fire by Communards, such as the City Hall, were rebuilt in the 1870s. After much hesitation, the Third Republic eventually decided not to restore the ruins of the Tuileries, which had become a symbol of the former royal and imperial regimes. However, the portions of the Louvre that had also been destroyed by fire were rebuilt in their original style. Demolition The Ch√¢teau de la Punta in Corsica which was partially built with stones from the Tuileries In 1882, the French National Assembly voted for the demolition of the ruins, which were sold to a private entrepreneur for the sum of 33,300 gold francs (approximately US$161,367 in 2015), despite the protests of Baron Haussmann and other members of French artistic and architectural circles, who opposed what they thought was a crime against French arts and history. The demolition was started in February 1883 and completed on 30 September 1883. Bits of stone and marble from the palace were sold by a private entrepreneur, Achille Picart, as souvenirs, and even to build a castle in Corsica, near Ajaccio, the , which is essentially a reconstruction of the Pavillon de Bullant. The courtyard pediment of the central pavilion can be seen in Paris' , some courtyard is in the garden of the Trocadero. Other pieces are in the Louvre, the Museum of Decorative Arts, and at schools of architecture, fine arts, and bridges and roads. The Tuileries Garden and the Axe historique Afternoon at the Tuileries Park by Adolph von Menzel Tuileries Garden The Tuileries Garden () covers ; is surrounded by the Louvre (to the east), the Seine (to the south), the Place de la Concorde (to the west) and the Rue de Rivoli (to the north); and still closely follows the design laid out by the royal landscape architect Andr√© Le N√¥tre in 1664. The Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume is a museum of contemporary art located in the northwest corner of the garden. Originally designed in 1564 as an Italian Renaissance garden by Bernard de Carnesse, the Tuileries Garden was redesigned in 1664 by Le N√¥tre as a jardin √† la fran√ßaise, which emphasized symmetry, order, and long perspectives. His formal garden plan drew out the perspective from the reflecting pools one to the other in an unbroken vista along a central axis from the west palace fa√ßade, which has been extended as the Axe historique. The Axe historique This straight line which runs through the Place de la Concorde and the Arc de Triomphe to La D√©fense was originally centred on the fa√ßade of the Tuileries, a similar line leading across the entrance court of the Louvre. As the two fa√ßades were placed at slightly differing angles, this has resulted in a slight 'kink' on the site of the palace, a feature ultimately dictated by the curved course of the River Seine. After the palace was demolished in 1883, the large empty space between the northern and southern wings of the Louvre, now familiar to modern visitors, was revealed, and for the first time the Louvre courtyard opened onto the unbroken Axe historique. Proposed reconstruction Le N√¥tre's central axis of the Tuileries' parterres in a late 17th-century engraving The same view today, past the palace's site to the Palais du Louvre Since 2003, the Committee for the Reconstruction of the Tuileries () has been proposing to rebuild the Tuileries Palace. This effort is similar to the proposal of reconstruction of the Berliner Stadtschloss (Berlin City Palace). Several reasons for rebuilding the Palace of the Tuileries have been advanced. Ever since the destruction of 1883, the famous perspective of the Champs-√âlys√©es, which ended on the majestic fa√ßade of the Tuileries Palace, now ends at the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, formerly centered on the Tuileries but now occupying a large empty space. The Louvre, with its pyramid on the one hand, and the Axe historique of the Place de la Concorde-Champs- √âlys√©es-Arc de Triomphe on the other, are not aligned on the same axis. The Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel fortuitously stands near the intersection of the two axes. The Palace of the Tuileries, which was located at the junction of these two diverging axes, helped to disguise this bending of the axes. Architects argue that the rebuilding of the Tuileries would allow the re- establishment of the harmony of these two different axes. The Tuileries Gardens would also recover their purpose, which was to be a palace garden. Also, it is emphasized that the Mus√©e du Louvre needs to expand its ground plan to properly display all its collections, and if the Tuileries Palace were rebuilt the Louvre could expand into the rebuilt palace. It is also proposed to rebuild the state apartments of the Second Empire as they stood in 1871. Plans of the palace and many photographs are stored at the Archives Nationales. Furthermore, furniture and paintings from the palace survived the 1871 fire because they had been removed in 1870 at the start of the Franco- Prussian War and stored in secure locations. Today, the furniture and paintings are still deposited in storehouses and are not on public display due to the lack of space in the Louvre. It is argued that recreating the state apartments of the Tuileries would allow the display of these treasures of the Second Empire style which are currently hidden. Government officials in charge of France's architectural heritage have been less than enthusiastic. Michel Cl√©ment, Director of Architecture and Heritage, stated that, \\"From our point of view, the reconstruction of the Tuileries Palace is not a priority. In addition, it is not part of French heritage culture to resurrect monuments out of the ground ex nihilo. Rather, we are concerned with the vestiges that have survived.\\" Cost In 2006 a rebuilding of the Palace of the Tuileries was estimated to cost 300 million euros (¬£200 million pounds sterling or US$380 million). The plan was to finance the project by public subscription with the work being undertaken by a private foundation, with the French government spending no money on the project. The French president at that time, Jacques Chirac, called for a debate on the subject. Former president Charles de Gaulle had also supported reconstruction, saying that it would \\"make a jewel of the centre of Paris.\\" Gallery File:Paris moderne.

Born to KekƒÅuluohi and High Chief Charles Kana ªina, he was of royal descent and a grandnephew of King Kamehameha I. He was educated at the Royal School by American missionaries and was proclaimed eligible for the throne by King Kamehameha III. After the death of King Kamehameha V, he was elected to the throne in 1873 by a unanimous decision of the legislature of the kingdom. Due to his popularity and status as Hawaii's first elected monarch, he became known as \\"The People's King\\". He died a year later from tuberculosis. Early life Lunalilo as a teenager. William Charles Lunalilo was born on January 31, 1835 in a two-story house made of coral brick, an area known as Pohukaina, now part the grounds of the  ªIolani Palace in Honolulu. His mother was High Chiefess Miriam Auhea KekƒÅuluohi (later styled as Ka ªahumanu III) and his father was High Chief Charles Kana ªina. He was grandnephew of Kamehameha I by blood and the monarch's stepson by marriage to his mother. His grandmother was KalƒÅkua KaheiheimƒÅlie, sister of Kamehameha's favorite wife, Queen Ka ªahumanu. This made him both, a second cousin as well as first cousin to King Kamehameha V, King Kamehameha IV, and Princess Victoria KamƒÅmalu through their mothers: KekƒÅuluohi and Kƒ´na ªu (later styled as Ka ªahumanu II) who were half-sisters. Lunalilo translates as Luna (high) lilo (lost) or \\"so high up as to be lost to sight\\" in the Hawaiian language. He was also named after King William IV of the United Kingdom, a great friend of the Hawaiian royal family. He was declared eligible to succeed by the royal decree of King Kamehameha III and sent to the Chief's Children's School (later called the Royal School) when it was founded by missionaries Amos Starr Cooke and Juliette Montague Cooke. Learning to speak both Hawaiian and English, he gained a mastery of English literature and love of Shakespearian soliloquies. According to one of his cousins, Elizabeth Kekaaniau, Lunalilo was groomed to one day assume the Governorship of Oahu after Kek≈´anƒÅo ªa's death. Before the Great Mahele Lunalilo's holdings of 239  ªƒÅina were second only to Kamehameha III. As a result of the Mahele, he relinquished 73 percent of his land. As of 1848, at the age of thirteen, he was still one of the largest landowners after the King, inheriting the land and personal property given to his mother and grandmother by Kamehameha I. In 1850 Lunalilo gave up another large amount of land to the government reducing his holdings to 43 lots. Affectionately known as \\"Prince Bill,\\" he was one of the royals (besides KalƒÅkaua and Lili ªuokalani) to write music. He composed Hawaii's first national anthem, \\"E Ola Ke Ali ªi Ke Akua,\\" which was Hawaii's version of \\"God Save The King\\". He wrote the song in fifteen minutes in a contest hosted by newspaper publisher Henry Whitney in 1862 for the birthday of Kamehameha IV. He won the contest and was awarded ten dollars. Lunalilo served on the Privy Council of State, the advisory council for the monarch, from 1863 to 1865, during the reign of his cousin King Kamehameha V. He also served on the House of Nobles, the upper house of the legislature, traditionally reserved for the high chiefs, from 1863 to 1872. Prospective royal brides Photograph of a young Lunalilo by Henry L. Chase. He was betrothed to his cousin Princess Victoria KamƒÅmalu, a popular choice among the Hawaiian people except for Victoria's brothers. They both refused to have her marry him. Their children would outrank the House of Kamehameha in family rank (mana). There were two failed attempts of marriage between the two. Lunalilo composed the Hawaiian song  ªAlekoki for his unrequited love. After Victoria, he briefly courted the hand of Lili ªuokalani, but she broke off the engagement on the advice of Kamehameha IV. Lili ªuokalani would eventually marry American John Owen Dominis and Victoria KamƒÅmalu would die unmarried and childless at the age of 27 in 1866. Another alleged prospective bride was a maternal cousin Miriam Auhea KekƒÅuluohi Crowningburg, who married a German-American settler instead. During his reign as king, it was proposed that he marry Queen Emma, the widow of Kamehameha IV, but this proposal came to nothing due to Queen Emma's devotion to her late husband. They remained friends and it was said he considered naming her as his heir before he died. According to Emma's cousin Peter Ka ªeo, there were gossips that the King would marry a Tahitian chiefess from Bora Bora. Although never marrying, the king took Eliza Meek (1832‚Äì1888), the hapa-haole daughter of Captain John Meek, the harbor pilot of Honolulu, and sister-in-law of his chamberlain Horace Crabbe, as his mistress. Election Lunalilo was considered the more popular candidate. King Kamehameha V, the last of the Kamehameha kings, died on December 11, 1872 without naming a successor. Under the Kingdom's 1864 constitution, if the king did not appoint a successor, a new king would be elected by the legislature from the eligible Hawaiian royals still alive. The other candidate was David KalƒÅkaua. Lunalilo was the more popular of the two. His grandfather was Kalaimamahu, a half brother of Kamehameha I and was thus a cousin of King Kamehameha V. His grandmother was Queen Kalakua Kaheiheimalie, sister of Queen Ka ªahumanu. Because of this, many people believed the throne rightly belonged to Lunalilo since the only person more closely related to Kamehameha V, Bernice Pauahi Bishop, made clear she did not want the throne. Another contender was Princess Ruth Ke ªelik≈çlani who was a half sister to King Kamehameha V. She was a favorite among the Hawaiian chiefs because of her adhering to the old Hawaiian ways. She was governess of Hawaii and refused to speak English even though she was fluent in it. Her genealogy, however, was too controversial and few people considered her suitable to take the throne. This left KalƒÅkaua and Lunalilo, and of the two, Lunalilo was greatly favored. So great was Lunalilo's popularity that some people believed that Lunalilo could have simply walked into the capital and declared himself king. Lunalilo, however, insisted that the constitution be followed. He issued the following message six days after the death of Kamehameha V: > \\"Whereas, it is desirable that the wishes of the Hawaiian people be > consulted as to a successor to the Throne, therefore, notwithstanding that > according to the law of inheritance, I am the rightful heir to the Throne, > in order to preserve peace, harmony and good order, I desire to submit the > decision of my claim to the voice of the people.\\" Lunalilo, unlike his more conservative opponent, wanted to amend the constitution to make the government more democratic by removing property qualifications for voting. It was decided that there would be a popular election to give the people a chance to have their voices heard. However, because the constitution gave the legislature the power to decide who would be the next king, the popular election would be unofficial. Lunalilo urged the people of the Kingdom to have their voices heard. The popular vote was held on January 1, 1873 and Lunalilo won by an overwhelming majority. The week after, the legislature unanimously voted Lunalilo king. It has been speculated that the reason for the unanimous vote was because each legislator was required to sign his name on the back of his ballot, and the legislators were afraid to go against the wishes of the people. Queen Emma later wrote in a letter that hundreds of Hawaiians were ready to tear to pieces anyone who opposed Lunalilo. At Lunalilo's investiture ceremony, held on January 9, 1873 at Kawaiaha ªo Church, the courtyard was filled to capacity and a large crowd watched from outside. Because Lunalilo's popularity was so great, and because he became king through a democratic process, he became known as \\"The People's King.\\" Reign as King Danish artist Eiler Jurgensen,  ªIolani Palace When Lunalilo assumed the duties of the king, a huge change in the government's policy began to form. His predecessor, Kamehameha V, had spent his reign increasing the powers of his office and trying to restore the absolute monarchy of his grandfather, Kamehameha I. Lunalilo, however, spent his reign trying to make the Hawaiian government more democratic. He started by writing to the legislature, recommending that the constitution be amended. He wanted to undo some changes that his predecessor had made when he enacted the 1864 Constitution. For example, the Kingdom legislature prior to 1864 met in two houses: The House of Nobles and the House of Representatives. The members of the House of Nobles were appointed by the King and the Representatives were elected by popular vote. Lunalilo served in the House of Nobles from 1863 through 1872. Under King Kamehameha V, the two houses of legislature were combined into one. Lunalilo wished to restore the bicameral legislature. He also wanted to add a provision to the constitution that required the king to include a written explanation to accompany any veto by the king. He wanted cabinet ministers to be heard in the House of Representatives. The King also wanted to improve Hawaii's economic situation. The Kingdom was in an economic depression, with the whaling industry rapidly declining. Commerce groups asked the king to look at sugar to improve the economy and recommended that a treaty be drawn with the United States to allow Hawaiian sugar to enter the nation tax-free. To make such a treaty, many thought that the Kingdom would have to offer the Pearl Harbor area to the United States in exchange. There was much controversy over this, with both the public and in the legislature. When Lunalilo saw this opposition, he dropped the proposal. During Lunalilo's reign, a mutiny took place in the small Hawaiian army. Some members of the army revolted against the drillmaster and the adjutant general. The king interviewed the troops involved in the mutiny and he persuaded them to lay down their arms. Following this, the king disbanded the army. From that point on, the Kingdom had no armed forces until King KalƒÅkaua restored them. Illness and death King Lunalilo had some bad health habits; for example, he was an alcoholic. Around August 1873, Lunalilo contracted a severe cold which developed into pulmonary tuberculosis. In hopes of regaining his health, he moved to Kailua-Kona. A few months later, on February 3, 1874, he died from tuberculosis at the age of 39, at Haimoeipo, his private residence in Honolulu. Lunalilo had reigned for one year and twenty-five days. King Lunalilo's Mausoleum. On his deathbed, he requested a burial at Kawaiaha ªo Church on the church's ground. He wanted, he said, to be \\"entombed among (my) people, rather than the kings and chiefs\\" at the Royal Mausoleum in Nu ªuanu Valley. This was due to a feud between Lunalilo and the Kamehameha family over his mother KekƒÅuluohi's exclusion from the list of royalty to be buried there. Thus, on November 23, 1875, his remains were taken from the Mausoleum, where it had rest temporarily awaiting the completion of the Lunalilo Mausoleum, to the completed tomb on the grounds of Kawaiaha ªo Church. His father requested a second funeral and a 21-gun salute from KalƒÅkaua like during his first funeral. KalƒÅkaua granted the second funeral but refused to allow the 21-gun salute. During this procession, eyewitness reports stated that a sudden storm arose, and that twenty-one rapid thunderclaps echoed across Honolulu which came to be known as the \\"21-gun salute.\\" Like his predecessor, Lunalilo did not designate an heir to the throne. It was said he had intended for Queen Emma to succeed him, but died before a formal proclamation could be made. The most prevalent explanation of this delay is regarding his democratic principles: he wished to have the people choose their next ruler. However, the constitution of 1864 had charged the legislature, not the people, with the task of electing the next king. In the end, KalƒÅkaua of the House of KalƒÅkaua was voted to succeed Lunalilo as king. The election provoked the Honolulu Courthouse riots in which supporters of Queen Emma targeted legislators who supported KalƒÅkaua; thirteen legislators were injured, with J. W. Lonoaea the only one to die from his injuries. Legacy In his will, Lunalilo set aside lands for the establishment of the Lunalilo Home, the first charitable trust established by a Hawaiian ali ªi trust, to house the poor, destitute, and infirmed people of Hawaiian descent, with preference given to older people.

He served as Archbishop of Montreal from 1950 to 1967, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1953 by Pope Pius XII.  Early life and education  Paul-√âmile L√©ger was born April 26, 1904 in Salaberry- de-Valleyfield, Quebec to Ernest L√©ger, a general merchant, and Alda Beauvais. He grew up in Saint-Anicet, where he served as an altar boy with his brother, Jules, and attended elementary school. He studied at Petit S√©minaire de Sainte-Th√©r√®se from 1916 to 1925, which was interrupted due to illness for almost four years beginning in January 1920. From 1925 to 1929 he studied theology at the Grand S√©minaire de Montr√©al. L√©ger entered the Jesuit novitiate at Sault-au-R√©collet, but was regarded as too emotional to continue in that order. L√©ger was transferred to the Valleyfield diocese after becoming ordained as a priest on May 25, 1929. L√©ger's first assignment was as a priest in the parish of Notre-Dame in Montreal. After joining the Society of Saint- Sulpice in September 1929 he was sent to its noviciate in Issy-les-Moulineaux for his period of solitude in 1929‚Äì1930. He then spent a year at the Institut Catholique de Paris studying canon law. L√©ger then taught this for a year after earning his bachelor's degree in 1931. He then become assistant master at the noviciate the following year.  Japan mission  L√©ger returned to Canada to visit his parents in 1933. Later that year he left Montreal for Fukuoka, Japan, to set up a grand s√©minaire for educating indigenous clergy. L√©ger rapidly became established as a preacher and spent his first year mastering Japanese. After ten months of being in Japan, he became cur√© of the cathedral in Tokyo. He left that post, drained, in August 1935. The goal of the mission remained the same, but L√©ger faced a number of major obstacles. Although the diocese was founded in 1927 and had less than 10,000 Catholics, nothing was organized. He returned to Canada from December 1935 to October 1936 to advertise his missionary work. He remained in Japan until the beginning of World War II.  Appointments and posts  He was professor of sociology in Montreal and professor of apologetics at the Pius XI Institute from 1939 to 1940. In 1940 L√©ger became the vicar general of the Diocese of Valleyfield, and the parish priest at St. Cecilia Cathedral. He had to temporarily leave the Society of Saint-Sulpice. He held these posts until 1947 when he was named rector of the Canadian Pontifical College in Rome. He was affectionately received by Pope Pius XII due to the aid Gold Cross, a Quebec charity L√©ger founded, was providing to Rome after the war. L√©ger was appointed archbishop of Montreal on March 25, 1950 by Pope Pius XII, and was raised to the rank of Monsignor on September 29, 1942. He was appointed a cardinal on November 29, 1952, one of the youngest in recent history. On January 12, 1953 he was given the honor of wearing the red hat, the first in Montreal. In this capacity he would perform the duties of the papal legate in Lourdes, France (1954), at St Joseph's Oratory in Montreal (1955), and in Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupr√© (1958). L√©ger was named a member of the Central Preparatory Commission on June 15, 1960.  Later career  L√©ger put emphasis on the importance love over procreation. He was also concerned with fathers being responsible. His most compelling speeches are collected in Trente textes du cardinal L√©ger qui ont marqu√© l'√âglise au concile et au Qu√©bec. L√©ger argued for more freedom of opinion. His views aligned with Pope John XXIII, who advocated for aggiornamento. His work on the Central Preparatory Commission led to close affiliations with other cardinals leading edge of modernization in the church. In August 1962, L√©ger, disappointed in the preparatory schemata of the first conciliar period, petitioned John XXIII along with six of the leading European cardinals. L√©ger stood out as a leader during the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965) even though his positions cost him some friendships and made him some enemies. His activity mainly focused on ecumenism; family, including procreation and marriage; freedom of thought within the church; the liturgy; religious freedom; and the place of the Holy Scriptures in the church. Despite his prominence and popularity at the council, his rigid stances created rivalries, including with some that supported modernization of the church. From late December 1963 to early January 1964 L√©ger returned to his missionary work, travelling to Africa. After returning to Canada, he wanted to help leprosaria with his Fame Pereo charity. He began to divest some personal belongings to help the poor. He even went as far as to propose he leave his see in Montreal to apply himself to missionary work, but Paul VI rejected it. L√©ger with the Quebec bishops and Archbishop Roy delicately negotiated with the government, resulting in major institutional revamping in education, health, and social services. Notably, Bill 60 led to the Department of Education's establishment in 1964. L√©ger saved the church contention with the government of Quebec by adopting conservative and equitable stances. After the council ended L√©ger returned to the norm of overseeing his archdiocese. He faced resistance from Quiet Revolution forces when trying to implement aggiornamento. It was difficult to work with the clergy in his archdiocese, and his relationships with fellow bishops were strained. L√©ger engaged in church administration as a member of the Sacred Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Sacred Congregation of Rites, the Sacred Consistorial Congregation, the Fabric of Saint Peter, the Pontifical Commission for the Revision of the Code of Canon Law, and the first assembly of the Synod of Bishops (1967). By 1967 Archbishop Roy took L√©ger's spot as Pope Paul VI's special Canada representative. On November 9, 1967 L√©ger announced his resignation as archbishop of Montreal with the intent to devote himself to working among the African lepers. This decision caused an uproar in the media surprised the public. L√©ger was enthralled with Africa. There were challenges and complexities with the changing landscape of church in Montreal, including increased population and lack of proportional increase of staff and implementation of the Vatican's directives. L√©ger left Montreal on December 11, 1967 making some short stops, visiting leprosaria supported by Fame Pereo, before settling in the archdiocese of Yaound√©, Cameroon. There he established around 40 aid projects. Until 1979 he dedicated himself almost completely to his ministry, interrupted by two trips back to Montreal. He served on the Pontifical Commission for Migrants and Tourism (1972‚Äì79) and on the Sacred Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples (1972‚Äì84).  Death  In July 1984 L√©ger was admitted to S√©minaire de Saint-Sulpice and spent his last two years confined to a wheelchair before dying at age 87 on November 13, 1991. He was the last surviving cardinal created by Pius XII.Sulpician Cardinals Through History  Views   Role during the Second Vatican Council  The cardinal was a leading liberal force at the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965). With the assistance of Cardinals Antonio Caggiano and Norman Gilroy, he delivered one of the closing messages of the council on December 8, 1965.Christus Rex. To Men of Though and Science  Religious liberty  He supported religious liberty at the council.A Cardinal for a Leper Colony November 17, 1967  Birth control  He was one of the council fathers who, in a speech delivered on 29 October 1964 concerning the document later promulgated as the Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, Gaudium et Spes, raised the question of a possible change in the Church's teaching on birth control. In the same speech, he urged that the document place more emphasis on conjugal love as an end or purpose of marriage.History of Vatican II, Giuseppe Alberigo (ed.), vol. IV, pp.309f. Cf.

It is located in the same region as the smaller but more famous and accessible Milford Sound. It took second place after Milford Sound as New Zealand's most famous tourism destination.Real Journeys rapt with Kiwi Must-Do's ‚Äì Scoop Independent News, Tuesday 13 February 2007 At long, Doubtful Sound is the second longest, and with a depth of up to the deepest of the South Island's fiords. In comparison with Milford Sound, it is more widespread, with the cliffs not as dramatically tall and near vertical. However, the U-shaped profile of the fiord is obvious, in particular on the two innermost of the main fiord's arms and the hanging side valleys along the main fiord. Like most of Fiordland, Doubtful Sound receives a high amount of rainfall, ranging from an annual average of . The vegetation on the mountainous landscape surrounding the fiord is dense native rainforest.  History  Doubtful Sound was named 'Doubtful Harbour' in 1770 by Captain Cook, who did not enter the inlet as he was uncertain whether it was navigable under sail.Cook's Voyages (from Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand. Accessed 2008-09-12.) It was later renamed Doubtful Sound by whalers and sealers, although it is not technically a sound but a fiord. A Spanish scientific expedition commanded by Alessandro Malaspina visited Doubtful Sound in February 1793 to conduct experiments measuring the force of gravity using a pendulum, a part of the effort to establish a new metric system.\\"Puerto del Pendulo, Doubtful Sound: The Malaspina Expedition's Visit to New Zealand in Quest of the True Figure of the Earth\\", The Globe, no.65, 2010, pp.1‚Äì18.

Today these form a unique cluster containing most of the Spanish names on the map of New Zealand: Febrero Point, Bauza Island and the Nee Islets, Pendulo Reach, and Malaspina Reach.Science and Spycraft: The Malaspina Expedition in New Zealand and New South Wales, 1793 ‚Äì Robert J. King, via Mains‚Äôl Haul, A Journal of Pacific Maritime History, San Diego, Vol 41 No. 4 & 42, No. 1, Fall/Winter 2006, Pages 76‚Äì87 Following the passage of the Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the name of the fiord was officially altered to Doubtful Sound / Patea. Geography Simple map of the Doubtful Sound complex of fiords and islands Doubtful Sound lies deep within the Fiordland National Park, about from the nearest inhabited place, the small town of Manapouri, and is surrounded by mountainous terrain with peaks typically reaching . Along the coast, there are no settlements for about in either direction. There are three distinct arms to the sound, which all extend to the south from the main fiord. From the major conflux of water just south of Secretary Island, these arms are: # First Arm, the shortest at long, # Crooked Arm, roughly halfway along the sound and the longest at long, # Hall Arm ( long), which branches off from the Sound's terminus at Deep Cove next to the prominent Commander Peak. Crooked Arm reaches to within of Te RƒÅ / Dagg Sound, almost cutting off a landmass of about . The Sound is the site of several large waterfalls, notably Helena Falls at Deep Cove and the Browne Falls, which have a fall of over . The steep hills surrounding the main fiord and its arms are known for their hundreds of waterfalls during the rainy season. Doubtful Sound contains about a dozen smaller islands, with the more notable ones being Elizabeth Island, Fergusson Island, Bauza Island, and the Shelter Islands. Parts of the sound on the west side of Elizabeth Island are protected by the Taipari Roa (Elizabeth Island) Marine Reserve. Doubtful Sound's Shelter Islands The last quarter of the sound closest to the sea is dominated by islands, the major one being Secretary Island to the north. At the southernmost tip of the island, Doubtful Sound opens up as a confluence of 5 bodies of water. From the western seaward end and going clockwise, these are: # Seaward end of Doubtful Sound, often referred to as \\"The Gut\\" # Te Awa-o-T≈´ / Thompson Sound # Kaikiekie / Bradshaw Sound # Continuation of Doubtful Sound to Deep Cove (Malaspina Reach) # First Arm The narrow, shallower area of the sound between Bauza Island and Secretary Island (\\"The Gut\\") offers more shelter than areas further to the west and towards the sea. It is a popular fishing and mooring location and is a haven for crayfish. Thompson Sound and Bradshaw Sound join in a short stretch named \\"Pendulo Reach\\" southeast of Secretary Island, and containing the tiny Seymour Island. Access to the sound is either by sea or via the isolated Wilmot Pass road from the Manapouri Power Station. Most areas of the sound itself are accessible only by sea, however, as the road network in this area of New Zealand is sparse or nonexistent, as is the human population. Charles John Lyttelton, 10th Viscount Cobham, Governor-General of New Zealand (1957‚Äì1962) wrote about this part of Fiordland: :\\"There are just a few areas left in the world where no human has ever set foot. That one of them should be in a country so civilized and so advanced as New Zealand may seem incredible, unless one has visited the south- west corner of the South Island. Jagged razor backed mountains rear their heads into the sky. More than 200 days of rain a year ensure not a tree branch is left bare and brown, moss and epiphytes drape every nook. The forest is intensely green. This is big country... one day peaceful, a study in green and blue, the next melancholy and misty, with low cloud veiling the tops... an awesome place, with its granite precipices, its hanging valleys, its earthquake faults and its thundering cascades.\\" Flora and fauna An example of a black coral found at a depth of in \\"the gut\\" area of the sound, complete with a snake star. Doubtful Sound (like many of the fiords in the area) is unusual in that it contains two distinct layers of water that scarcely mix. The surface layer , referred to as the Low Salinity Layer or LSL, consists of diluted seawater with a typical salinity value of less than 10 psu. This layer receives fresh water fed from the high inflows from the surrounding mountains, and stained brown with tannins from the forest. The outflow of freshwater from the tailrace discharge from the Manapouri Power Station also influences the thickness of the LSL. Below the LSL is a layer of warmer, undiluted seawater with a salinity value of around 35 psu. The dark tannins in the fresh water layer make it difficult for light to penetrate. Thus, many deep-sea species grow in the comparatively shallow depths of the Sound. Such species include black coral Antipathes fiordensis, which is normally found at depths of but can be found at just in Doubtful Sound and is within the range of qualified recreational divers. The catchment basin of Doubtful Sound is generally steep terrain that is heavily forested except for locations where surface rock exposures are extensive. Nothofagus trees are dominant in many locations. In the understory there are a wide variety of shrubs and ferns, including the crown fern, Blechnum discolor.C. Michael Hogan. 2009. Crown Fern: Blechnum discolor, Globaltwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg The fiord is home to one of the southernmost populations of bottlenose dolphins. The Doubtful Sound bottlenoses have formed a very insular subgroup of only about 70 individuals, with none having been observed to leave or enter the Sound during a multi-year monitoring regime. Their social grouping is thus extremely close, which is also partly attributed to the difficult and unusual features of their habitat, which is much colder than the habitats of other bottlenose groups and is also overlaid by the freshwater layer.Bottlenose dolphins (from Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand. Accessed 2008-09-12.) Recently (2000s), there has been growing concern that the population is in significant decline, with calf survival rates having halved, as well as being noticeably lower than in captivity or in other New Zealand environments. The reasons for this are unclear, though increased tourism and the fresh-water discharge from the Manapouri Power Station (see Hydroelectricity section below) are considered potential causes. Other wildlife to be found in Doubtful Sound includes fur seals and penguins, or even large whales.http://www.backpackersnews.co.nz/index.php?page=whale-sightings-up/ Southern right whales and humpback whales are the most frequently seen especially the later.https://www.odt.co.nz/regions/queenstown-lakes/whale- watchers-dream Others include minke whale, sperm whale and some giant beaked whales). Orcas (killer whales) and long-finned pilot whales can be found also. The waters of Doubtful Sound are also home to an abundance of sea creatures, including many species of fish, starfish, sea anemones, and corals. It is perhaps best known for its black coral trees which occur in unusually shallow water for what is normally a deep-water species. The sound has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it is a breeding site for Fiordland penguins.BirdLife International. (2012). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Doubtful Sound. Downloaded from on 2012-02-18. Secretary Island and Bauza Island are some of the most important sanctuaries in New Zealand for critically endangered birds. Hydroelectricity Deep Cove, below Wilmot Pass ‚Äì the outlet from the Manapouri Hydro Power Station is in the center Deep Cove (), the innermost end of Doubtful Sound, is the site of discharge of water from the Manapouri Power Station's tailrace tunnels. Deep Cove, like the rest of Fiordland, is a unique and mostly pristine environment. The discharge of clear fresh water has affected fauna and flora by letting light into the lower layers of the sound.A Doubtful future ‚Äì New Zealand Listener, 27 September 2008 Nevertheless, this is an area naturally high in fresh water inflows ( of rain falls annually). The small wharf at Deep Cove is on rare occasion also used to unload any equipment for the Manapouri Power Station that is too large to be ferried across Lake Manapouri. From Deep Cove, such equipment then has to be hauled over Wilmot Pass to the power station. Tourism Tall tour boat dwarfed even by one of the smaller islands in Doubtful Sound Unlike the more easily accessible Milford Sound, it is not possible to drive to Doubtful Sound, as the Wilmot Pass road is not connected to the road network and only connects the Manapouri Hydro Power Station with Deep Cove. The only options for visitors to visit Doubtful Sound are boat cruises. The less common way to access Doubtful Sound is by sea. However, there are some boat cruises that operate out of the small town of Manapouri. These day trips first take a boat across Lake Manapouri and then a bus on the gravel road across Wilmot Pass to the Sound, where the Doubtful Sound tour boats berth at a small wharf in Deep Cove. The tour companies offer a day option out of Te Anau/Manapouri or an overnight option.

(Click on the image to access the actual 512√ó512px standard test version.) Lenna or Lena is the name given to a standard test image widely used in the field of image processing since 1973. It is a picture of the Swedish model Lena Fors√©n, shot by photographer Dwight Hooker, cropped from the centerfold of the November 1972 issue of Playboy magazine. The spelling \\"Lenna\\" came from the model's desire to encourage the proper pronunciation of her name. \\"I didn't want to be called Leena [],\\" she explained. IPA pronunciation of Leena inserted into the quotation in brackets for clarity. is a common English pronunciation of the name Lena. The quotation reads, \\"At her suggestion, the editors [of Playboy] spelled her first name with an extra 'n,' to encourage proper pronunciation. 'I didn‚Äôt want to be called Leena,‚Äù she explained.'  History  Before Lenna, the first use of a Playboy magazine image to illustrate image processing algorithms was in 1961. Lawrence G. Roberts used two cropped 6-bit grayscale facsimile scanned images from Playboy's July 1960 issue featuring Playmate Teddi Smith (born Delilah Henry), in his MIT master's thesis on image dithering. Intended for high resolution color image processing study, the Lenna picture's history was described in the May 2001 newsletter of the IEEE Professional Communication Society, in an article by Jamie Hutchinson: This scan became one of the most used images in computer history. In a 1999 issue of IEEE Transactions on Image Processing \\"Lena\\" was used in three separate articles, and the picture continued to appear in scientific journals throughout the beginning of the 21st century. Lenna is so widely accepted in the image processing community that Fors√©n was a guest at the 50th annual Conference of the Society for Imaging Science and Technology (IS&T;) in 1997. The use of the photo in electronic imaging has been described as \\"clearly one of the most important events in [its] history\\". In 2015, Lena Fors√©n was also guest of honor at the banquet of IEEE ICIP 2015. After delivering a speech, she chaired the best paper award ceremony. To explain Lenna's popularity, David C. Munson, editor-in-chief of IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, noted that it was a good test image because of its detail, flat regions, shading, and texture. However, he also noted that its popularity was largely because an image of an attractive woman appealed to the males in a male- dominated field. While Playboy often cracks down on illegal uses of its material and did initially send out notices to research publications and journals that used the image, over time it has decided to overlook the wide use of Lena. Eileen Kent, VP of new media at Playboy, said, \\"We decided we should exploit this, because it is a phenomenon.\\"  Criticism  The use of the image has produced controversy because Playboy is \\"seen (by some) as being degrading to women\\", and the Lenna photo has been pointed to as an example of sexism in the sciences, reinforcing gender stereotypes. In a 1999 essay on reasons for the male predominance in computer science, applied mathematician Dianne P. O'Leary wrote: A 2012 paper on compressed sensing used a photo of the model Fabio Lanzoni as a test image to draw attention to this issue. The use of the test image at the magnet school Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County, Virginia provoked a guest editorial by a senior in The Washington Post in 2015 about its detrimental impact on aspiring female students in computer science. In 2017, the Journal of Modern Optics published an editorial titled \\"On alternatives to Lenna\\" suggesting three images (Pirate, Cameraman and Peppers) that \\"are reasonably close to Lenna in feature space\\". In 2018, the Nature Research family of journals announced that they would no longer consider articles using the Lenna image. In the same year SPIE, the publishers of Optical Engineering, also announced that they would discourage the use of the Lenna image, and would no longer consider new submissions containing the image \\"without convincing scientific justification for its use\\". Optical Engineering had previously featured the image on the cover of its July 1991 issue, which drew the attention of Playboy to the potential copyright infringement. On 31 October 2018, the TensorFlow Lite C++ image classification demo used an image of female computer science pioneer and US Navy Rear Admiral Grace Hopper as a test image. On 19 November 2019, Code Like a Girl released a film and campaign called Losing Lena,Losing Lena with the aim of eliminating use of the Lena image in order to encourage more female participation in computing.  Remastering  , Jeff Seideman, of the Society for Imaging Science and Technology, was working with the archivist of Playboy to rescan the image from the original negatives.

Blacktown is located 34 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district. Blacktown is the largest of any township in New South Wales and is one of the most multicultural places within Greater Sydney. History Blacktown Township, 1886, subdivision plan. Prior to the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, the area of today's Blacktown was inhabited by different groups of the Darug people including the Warmuli, based around what is now Prospect, and their neighbours the Gomerigal from the South Creek area and the Wawarawarry from the Eastern Creek area. It is estimated that fifty to ninety percent of the Darug died of smallpox and other introduced diseases within a few years of the British arrival. Governor Arthur Phillip began granting land in the area to white settlers in 1791. In 1819 Governor Lachlan Macquarie granted land to two indigenous men, Colebee and Nurragingy as payment for their service to The Crown, for assisting Cox with the road over the Blue Mountains and in dealing with Aboriginal issues. In 1804, the battle of Vinegar Hill was fought at Rouse Hill on 5 March. Convicts escaping from the Castle Hill barracks clashed with government troops under major George Johnson, declaring themselves to be for 'liberty or death'. The convicts were easily defeated and died in the battle. A few years later in 1823, the Native Institution (a school for Aboriginal children) was moved from Parramatta to the site where Richmond Road meets Rooty Hill Road North (this intersection is now in the suburbs of Oakhurst and Glendenning) which was named \\"The Blacks Town\\". The institution was then known as Black Town Native Institute and it was synonymous with the stolen generation. Although the institution closed in 1833, the road heading out to the Institute became known as the Black Town Road. In 1860 the Railway Department gave the name of Black Town Road Station to the railway station at the junction of the railway and the Black Town Road, with the name shortening to Blacktown by 1862. The arrival of the railway led to the formation of a town around the station. A post office was opened in 1862 and a school in 1877. In 1906, the Shire of Blacktown was formed and in 1930, electricity was introduced to the town. The population in 1933 was then around 13,000. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a large amount of suburban development both in the current suburb of Blacktown and the new suburbs that sprung up around it. This led to civic development in the town centre with the hospital opening in 1965, the courthouse and police station in 1966, the library in 1967 and the TAFE college in 1969. In 1973, the Westpoint shopping centre opened which was soon followed by the cinema complex. Commercial area The Blacktown Commercial Business District is located close to Blacktown railway station. Westpoint Blacktown is a major shopping centre and there are a number of small shops, restaurants and hotels in the surrounding area. Westpoint also houses a western suburb television studio of the Nine Network. The Blacktown CBD features the following landmarks: * Blacktown City Council corporate head office * Blacktown Courthouse * Blacktown Hospital * Blacktown Workers Club * Cucina Locale Revolving Restaurant * Max Webber Library ‚Äì Blacktown City Council's newly completed central library * Patrician Brothers' College Blacktown * Nagle College Blacktown A notable Blacktown retailer in the 1950s was Frank Lowy who conducted a delicatessen and small goods shop in Main Street. Blacktown Hospital Max Webber Library Blacktown Rail Station Transport According to the 2006 census, the most common way of getting to work from Blacktown was by car (74%) with public transport used by just under twenty percent. Most public transport was done by train (17%) with five percent catching buses for all or part of their journey. Blacktown railway station is on the North Shore & Western Line and the Cumberland Line of the Sydney Trains network. A major bus interchange is located next to the station and an underground bus station is at the entrance to Westpoint. Blacktown is a terminus of the North-West T-way. Busways provides services to Northern areas: (Rouse Hill, Castle Hill, Kellyville, Glenwood and Stanhope Gardens), West areas: (Mount Druitt, Plumpton, Oakhurst, Quakers Hill, Dean Park, Woodcroft) and South districts (Prospect, Arndell Park, Huntingwood, Tallawong, Doonside, Blacktown Hospital), whilst Hillsbus provides services: Eastern services (Macquarie Park, Seven Hills, Parramatta, Kings Langley). Schools The Blacktown Tourist Centre is located in the original Blacktown School building Blacktown Arts Centre The first school, a single-storey brick building with gables, was opened in 1877. While no longer in use as a school, the building in Flushcombe Road is now used as a Visitor Information Centre. It is the oldest remaining building in the Blacktown CBD and is heritage- listed. There are a large number of schools in the suburb. Government-run primary schools in the area include: Blacktown North Public School, Blacktown South Public School, Blacktown West Public School, Lynwood Park Public School, Marayong South Public School, Shelley Public School, and Walters Road Public School. Public high schools include: Blacktown Boys High School, Blacktown Girls High School, Evans High School and Mitchell High School. There is also the Coreen School, which caters to older children with learning difficulties. There are two Catholic primary schools, St Michaels Primary School and St Patricks Primary School, and two Catholic high schools, Nagle College for girls and Patrician Brothers' College Blacktown for boys. Tyndale Christian School is a private school covering children from kindergarten to year 12. Blacktown Arts Centre Blacktown Arts Centre is located at 78 Flushcombe Road on the highest point of land in the Blacktown CBD. Originally built in the 1950s as an Anglican church, the building was deconsecrated in 1999. Originally acquired by Blacktown Council as a site for a car park, the Council in partnership with Arts NSW subsequently refurbished the building as a multi- arts centre. The centre opened to the public in October 2002. In 2006 the centre underwent a multimillion-dollar refit and extension. The building reopened in April 2007 with facilities for performance, extended visual art galleries, workshop space and enhanced administrative areas.

The lake is situated within the Fiordland National Park and the wider region of Te Wahipounamu South West New Zealand World Heritage Area. MƒÅori History According to MƒÅori legend Lake Manapouri was created by the tears of two sisters, Moturua and Koronae, who were daughters of an old chief in the region. Koronae journeyed deep into the forest one day only to become stranded after a fall. Her sister Moturua went looking for her and when she found Koronae she realised that Koronae could not be rescued. Moturua lay with Koronae and there they lay until they died, their tears creating Lake Manapouri. Lake Manapouri means anxious or sorrowful heart because of the grief of the two sisters. However, the present name was given by mistake. An early settler accidentally called it by the name of one of the Mavora Lakes, which lie between Lake Te Anau and Lake Wakatipu. The original name of the lake is believed to have been Roto-ua which translates to Rainy Lake and later Moturau which means Many Islands. MƒÅori have a long history in the area, finding the lake and its surroundings offering an abundance of food in the form of eels and birds such as pigeon and New Zealand kaka (forest parrot). Manapouri was discovered by Europeans in 1852, by the explorers Charles J Nairn and W H Stevens. Geography Lake Manapouri was formed by glaciers during the last Holocene. The lake is New Zealand‚Äôs second deepest lake measuring deep. Lake Manapouri is above sea level however due to glaciers, Lake Manapouri has been cut deep into the ground and the bottom of the lake now lies below sea level. The lake has four arms, North, South, West and Hope with the smaller indentations of Shallow Bay and Calm Bay. Lake Manapouri contains 33 islands in total with 22 of these being wooded. Lying close to the centre of the lake is the largest island of Pomona Island. Other large islands include Holmwood Island, Rona Island and Mahara Island. The small settlement of Manapouri lies on the eastern shore. Outlet into Waiau River The Waiau River (Southland) is both a natural inlet and outlet for the lake, flowing into the northeast of the lake from Lake Te Anau, to the north and flowing out from Manapouri's south-eastern end. The outlet however has been diverted due to the development of Manapouri Hydroelectric Power Station. Water now flows unnaturally westward to the sea at Deep Cove. Rainfall in the area is high, however due to the mountains in the west rainfall is much higher in this area. The average rainfall for the western arm of Lake Manapouri is annually, while Manapouri Township on the eastern arm of the lake receives less than a third at annually. Lake Manapouri drains a large catchment area of . This includes the slopes of the Kepler Mountains, Turret Range and Hunter Mountains which surround all but the eastern shore of the lake. Water levels in the lake are predominantly high during spring due to snow melt and low in winter. Lake Manapouri is often described as New Zealand‚Äôs most beautiful lake. Biodiversity The area is well renowned for its fishing and high water quality. Both Lake Manapouri and Lake Te Anau lie within the ultra- oligotrophic index on the trophic state index with clear highly oxygenated waters of very low biological productivity. Both lakes along with the connecting Waiau River contain the New Zealand longfin eel and introduced brown trout and rainbow trout as well as some Atlantic salmon. The area is however free from macrophyte Lagarosiphon major an exotic and invasive species which has infiltrated many other New Zealand lakes. Lake Manapouri provides 73% of New Zealand‚Äôs longfin eel lake habitat protected from commercial fishing. However the lake has experienced a decline in numbers of longfin eels due to the construction of the hydro- electric dam blocking eel migration. The outflow passage is blocked by the hydro-electric dam which means that eels can be killed when passing through the turbines. A vertical slot fish pass was installed in 1999 and trap and transfer of elvers (young eels) was started in summer 1998/1999. Since the trap and transfer operation commenced in 1998/99 more than 407,000 elvers have been transferred upstream of the Maraoa Control structure. Catch totals in the trap and transfer system can vary in correspondence to surface water temperatures falling below . The trap and transfer technique was successful in improving fish distribution however operations had to be stopped in 2004 due to the concerns that transferring elvers to upstream habitats would spread the exotic invasive algae Didymosphenia geminata. The operation now transfers elvers just past the dam due to these concerns. There is concerns also that the trap and transfer operation does not trap enough silvers eels (eels of breading age) with an average of 200-400 annually. This however equates to only one silver eel per hectare within the lake which is much lower than standards recommended overseas. More research is needed to understand if trap and transfer is the best option in Lake Manapouri. Submerged vegetation within Lake Manapouri is mostly native species. Lake Manapouri has a high diversity of submerged vegetation. The rare Hydatella inconspicua an endemic shallow water plant was found in many of the Fiordland lakes including Lake Manapouri in 1998, this was the first reporting of it being in the South Island. The finding meant that the plant was no longer considered endangered. Surroundings North Arm of Lake Manapouri The shoreline in the North and West of the lake remains substantially unaltered since deglaciation. Beaches have formed on the lake where rivers bring sediment to areas where the near shore relief is not too steep allowing pocket beaches to form. The beaches around the lake show many similarities to ocean shores. The shape of the lake funnels wind and waves down the long axis which leads to longshore transport or littoral drift of sediment and size selective sorting. There are however a number of differences to ocean shores. The short fetch length produces a narrow range of wave conditions and this low energy limits the size of sediment in transport. Large changes to the beach profile are induced by fluctuations in lake level, major fluctuations can drown beaches. The beaches on the lake develop a distinctive shelf profile whereby beach sediments grade lakeward into fine sand. The outer edge of the shelf is marked by a shelf break and a transition to organic-rich muds on a steep offshore slope. There are a number of different types of beaches including pavement beaches, gravel, mixed sand and gravel beaches and sand beaches. View past Mahara Island towards Cathedral Peaks The islands around Lake Manapouri are of varying size and isolation. Many of the islands contain virtually unmodified vegetation. However, there is large diversity between islands in habitat biodiversity, with some islands being completely devoid of plants and soil and other rich in both. There is confusion as to some differences with some researchers finding that the area of an island plays a role in species richness with others find no correlation at all.Red deer have greatly modified much of Fiordlands' vegetation however only the two largest islands within Lake Manapouri contain introduced red deer while other islands are only occasionally visited by deer. The smaller islands around Lake Manapouri are extremely unusual as they contain natural vegetation which has not been harmed by red deer, as the red deer have not been able to reach the islands. On these islands palatable plants as well as deep moss mat on the forest floor persist under the dense understory layers of the forest. The Australian brush-tail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is not present on the islands. Hydro-power from the lake The lake provides hydro-electric power via the Manapouri Hydroelectric Power Station, in the West Arm, which discharges water through two tailrace tunnels to the sea at Deep Cove in Doubtful Sound. In 1959 it was proposed to raise the lake by up to for an increase in power generation for the development of an aluminium smelter. This resulted in a strong nationwide protest, the Save Manapouri campaign, lasting over a decade, which prevented the raising of the lake from taking place. The Save Manapouri campaign is regarded as a major milestone in the history of New Zealand's environmental protection. As a result of the campaign, lake levels are now controlled to close to that of natural fluctuations. The win also saw the establishment of the Guardians of Lake Manapouri and Te Anau. Integrated management of the lake The environmental movement of Save Lake Manapouri campaign, is considered to be the first environmental movement in New Zealand. When this movement won the campaign to stop levels on the lake being raised, the government formed the Guardians of Lake Manapouri and Te Anau. This meant that main campaigners during the Save Manapouri campaign were appointed to advise the managers of the hydro-electric power plant on the management of both Lake Manapouri and Lake Te Anau. This holistic management between nature conservation and hydro-electric development was unprecedented in New Zealand. The group was to ‚Äúreport and make recommendations of Government‚Ä¶ on any matter arising from the environmental, ecological and social effects of the construction and operation of the Manapouri-Te Anau electric power scheme on the townships of Manapouri and Te Anau, the lakes and shorelines of Te Anau and Manapouri, and the rivers flowing in and out of these lakes with particular reference to the effects of lake levels on scenic values, conservation, recreation, tourism and other related activities and amenities‚Äù. The guardians were entitled to reports from the Government on actions that had been taken that were deemed relevant so they could fulfil their jobs. Defining the natural variation of lake levels was considered very important. The lake had already experienced slumping due to a lowered lake level. Also the forest that surrounded the lake was reliant on a variation of water levels. Shoreline beech forest extended almost 3m below the highest natural lake level. The roots of this forest could be submerged for a maximum of 50 days meaning that lake levels needed to be maintained within a range that did not exceed this maximum. The raising of the lake levels too high also had the potential to submerge low-lying islands, many of which contained natural vegetation unharmed by red deer. Lake management guidelines were devised from geomorphological and ecological studies correlated with a 37-year lake level record. The concepts of High, Main and Low Operating Ranges were developed as a basis for management guidelines. The guidelines were verified in practice and incorporated into legislation in 1981. In 1987 the groundings for the Resource Management Act 1991 were being laid. The Government decided that all empowering legislation for hydro-electric stations should be re-issued. For Lake Manapouri this meant a public process was established whereby a working party was formed to examine and resolve a wide range of environmental issues. Lake management guidelines and shoreline monitoring were formalised under resource consents. Also included in the consents was the creation of regulation patterns through the Te Anau and Manapouri control structures to follow more closely to the natural fluctuations of the Waiau River. The resource consent set up legislation which could restore biological and recreational values to the lower river, particularly the section immediately below the dam. Compensation was also granted for a range of adverse environmental effects associated with the diverting of water through the power station. The Guardians of the Lake were given legal status in the 1990 amendment to the Conservation Act 1987 with additional and similar responsibility for Lake Monowai. The guardians are still active in 2012 and working alongside Meridian Energy, the current owner of the Lake Manapouri Hydroelectric Power Station.

It is mentioned in Shakespeare's play Macbeth, in which Macbeth is informed by a supernatural being, \\"Macbeth shall never vanquished be, until Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill Shall come against him.\\" The hill has a height of and commands expansive views of the surrounding countryside. It consists of a late Iron Age hill fort, the ramparts of which remain obvious. The site was damaged by undocumented amateur excavations in the 19th century by antiquarians attracted to the site by its Shakespearean connection. Little of value was learned about the history of the monument from these unscientific endeavours. Dunsinane is the traditional site of a 1054 battle in which Siward, Earl of Northumbria defeated Macbeth of Scotland. The much earlier Iron Age hill fort has long been known as Macbeth's Castle, though there is no archaeological evidence that it was in use by him or anyone during the mid eleventh century.  Pronunciation and etymology  To facilitate the rhyme in the couplet \\"I will not be afraid of death and bane, Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane\\" the pronunciation usually employed for Shakespeare's play has the accent on the first or third syllable, with a long \\"a\\" (i.e. or ). However the correct pronunciation has the accent on the second syllable, with a short \\"a\\". An alternative spelling of the name is Dunsinnan. The derivation is Gaelic, \\"the hill of ants\\"; possibly a reference to the large number of people it took to build the fortress.  Ascent  The village of Collace from Dunsinane Hill The best access to Dunsinane Hill is from the rear of the Perthshire village of Collace on the northern side of Dunsinane Hill, between the village and the quarry. There is a small parking area there suitable for 4 or 5 cars, from which a steep, but clearly defined path leads directly to the summit.

Alfred Toth, Mikes international, 2007 http://www.federatio.org/mi_bibl/AlfredToth_Mesopotamian.pdf In the 10th century CE, the drink was called Boza and became common amongst Central Asian Turkic peoples. Later it spread to the Caucasus and the Balkans. It enjoyed its golden age under the Ottomans, and boza-making became a common trade in towns and cities. Until the 16th century, boza was drunk freely everywhere, but the custom of making the so-called Tartar boza laced with opium brought the wrath of the authorities down on the drink, and it was prohibited by sultan Selim II (1566‚Äì1574). He describes a type of non-alcoholic sweet boza of a milk white color usually made by Albanians. In the 17th century, Sultan Mehmed IV (1648‚Äì1687) prohibited alcoholic drinks including boza, and closed down all the boza shops. This prohibition would be reinforced and then loosened several times in the history of the empire. The 17th century Turkish traveler Evliya √áelebi reports that boza was widely drunk at this time, and that there were 300 boza shops employing over a thousand people in Istanbul alone. In this period, boza was widely drunk by the Janissaries in the army. It contained only a low level of alcohol, so as long as it was not consumed in sufficient quantities to cause drunkenness, it was tolerated as a warming and strengthening beverage for soldiers. As Evliya √áelebi explained in the first volume (\\"Istanbul\\") of his Seyahatname (Travelogues), \\"These boza makers are numerous in the army. To drink sufficient boza to cause intoxication is sinful but, unlike wine, in small quantities it is not condemned.\\" In the 19th century, the sweet and non-alcoholic boza preferred at the Ottoman palace became increasingly popular, while the sour and alcoholic type of boza went out of style. In 1876, brothers Haci Ibrahim and Haci Sadik established a boza shop in the Istanbul district of Vefa, close to the then center of entertainment, Direklerarasƒ±. This boza, with its thick consistency and tart flavor, became famous throughout the city. It is the only boza shop dating from that period still in business today, and is now run by the founders' great-great-grandchildren.

The flavour varies according to the cereal which is used. Measuring boza samples made from maize, wheat, and rice flours, researchers determined an average of 12.3% total sugar, 1.06% protein, and 0.07% fat. Boza spoils if not kept in a cool place, therefore boza fermenters in Turkey did not sell boza during the hot summer traditionally, instead selling alternative beverages such as grape juice or lemonade. They produce it in the summer now due to increased availability of refrigeration, and revenue from high demand. Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Bulgaria, Albania, and North Macedonia produce boza as a refreshing beverage year-round.

After taking off, affable inmate Joe \\"Pinball\\" Parker incites a riot as a distraction, releasing Grissom and Diamond Dog who lead the takeover of the plane. The hijacking inmates plot to land at Carson Airport as scheduled, pick up and transfer other prisoners, and then fly to a non-extradition country. Sims tries to take control of the plane, but Grissom kills him. Poe and Grissom also foil Johnny 23's rape attempts on the plane's only female guard, Sally Bishop, due to Grissom's vocal hatred of rapists. The plane arrives at Carson City as scheduled and the inmate exchange commences, with the ground crew unaware that the hijackers are disguised as guards. As the transfer begins, most of the plane's guards and the pilot are forced to pose as inmates and conveyed off the plane. Amongst the new passengers are Cindino, new pilot Earl \\"Swamp Thing\\" Williams, and serial killer Garland Greene, who is feared by many inmates. The authorities discover the hijacking upon finding evidence in Grissom's old cell and a tape recorder placed with the disguised guards by Poe, but are unable to stop the plane from taking off. Meanwhile, Pinball, sent by the inmates to dispose of the plane's transponder to keep it from being detected, tries but fails to make it back to the hijacked plane. The inmates plan to land at Lerner Airport, an abandoned airstrip in the desert, and transfer onto another plane owned by Cindino and his cartel. Poe finds Pinball's corpse trapped in the landing gear, writing a message to the U.S. Marshals on the body before throwing it out. Larkin learns of the news and heads out to Lerner after contacting the National Guard. Bedford, raiding the cargo, discovers Poe's identity when he reads his parole letter and finds a toy bunny Poe intends to give to his daughter, forcing Poe to kill him. The Jailbird is grounded at Lerner, with no sign of the transfer aircraft. Poe warns the other inmates of Cindino's past acts of deceit and betrayal, and thus Grissom orders the others to fuel up the plane and get it ready for takeoff. Poe leaves to find Baby-O a syringe to give him insulin, meeting Larkin and informing him of the situation. The duo discover Cindino planning to escape on a hidden private jet, with Larkin sabotaging it as it takes off. Grissom executes Cindino by igniting the crashed plane's fuel. Meanwhile, Johnny 23, assigned as the sentry in the control tower, spots a National Guard convoy approaching and gives the alarm. The inmates quickly find a cache of fully loaded shotguns and M-16 rifles in the plane's cargo hold (originally assigned to guards) and prepare an ambush. As the National Guardsmen arrive, the inmates launch an assault; some are killed, but Larkin defends the surviving troops using a bulldozer as a makeshift shield. Several inmates are killed, and the rest flee back onto the Jailbird and take flight. Poe's identity is revealed when Bedford's body is found. Grissom is about to execute him and Baby-O when Larkin and Malloy arrive in attack helicopters, launching machine gun fire at it and damaging the Jailbirds fuel tank. Though Larkin orders the plane to land at McCarran International Airport, Swamp Thing is forced to land it on the Las Vegas Strip, causing mass destruction and killing Johnny 23. Cyrus, Diamond Dog, and Swamp Thing escape on a fire truck, pursued by Poe and Larkin on police motorcycles. The chase leads to the deaths of all three escapees, with Cyrus killed by a pile driver that crushes his head. As the rest of the other convicts are quickly re-apprehended, Poe and Larkin form a friendship, just as Tricia and Casey arrive. Poe meets his daughter for the first time and gives her the toy rabbit he bought for her. The only criminal unaccounted for is Garland Greene, who gambles at an undisclosed casino and is now apparently reformed.

The summons is known by various names in different jurisdictions. The term subpoena duces tecum is used in the United States, as well as some other common law jurisdictions such as South Africa and Canada. The summons is called a \\"subpoena for production of evidence\\" in some U.S. states that have sought to reduce the use of non-English words and phrases in court terminology. The subpoena duces tecum is similar to the subpoena ad testificandum, which is a writ summoning a witness to testify orally. However, unlike the latter summons, the subpoena duces tecum instructs the witness to bring in hand books, papers, or evidence for the court. In most jurisdictions, a subpoena usually has to be served personally. Etymology The phrase \\"subpoena duces tecum\\" is a Latin expression meaning literally \\"under [threat of] penalty [or punishment], you will bring [it] with you.\\" The word means \\"under\\" and \\"penalty\\"; \\"you will lead, guide, pull, bring\\"; and \\"with you\\" Order pursuant to a deposition In the United States, a notice to a party deponent (a person called to testify in a deposition) may be accompanied by a request for production of documents and other tangible things during the taking of a deposition. The notice to produce (literally: \\"bring these documents with you to the deposition\\") is served prior to the deposition. This follows the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 30(b)(5), also called FRCP The method of using a subpoena duces tecum is generally valid only to compel a witness to produce documents and other things at the time of the deposition. If a deponent is a non-party to the action (not involved directly in the litigation, but wanted for testimony), production of documents can be compelled only through a proper subpoena duces tecum. Depending on the nature of the documents, and their volume, some may be obtained directly, and before deposition under FRCP 34. In cases where a large number of documents are potentially relevant to the hearing, the court may order them to be produced prior to the deposition. This forms a part of legal discovery and allows parties involved time to review them prior to the deposition or other hearing. Federal cases and some states follow Rule 27(a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure concerning the production of documents in pretrial discovery, including those pertaining to depositions. These can include the subpoena duces tecum to produce documents, or in some cases to undergo a physical or mental examination. In the Ninth Circuit, interpreting Rule 27 literally, it has been held that a party can simply produce the documents only, and in certain cases, avoid an oral deposition when presented with a subpoena duces tecum.23 Am Jur 2nd Depositions and Discovery, ¬ß¬ß 126-127 Failure to produce documents A continuance (a rescheduling of a court hearing at a later date) of a civil action may be granted due to the absence of documents or papers. The party failing to produce the documents requested by a subpoena duces tecum must show good reason why there was a failure to do so. Acceptable explanations have included loss or destruction of papers, or an agreement to use copies. The party seeking the continuance must show that the absence of the documents is not because of the negligence of their own, or of the attorney of record.17 Am Jur 2nd \\"Continuance\\",¬ß 20 Similarly, a continuance may be granted in a criminal case if there is good reason documents pertinent to the case could not be produced at the time of trial. For example, a continuance should be granted for failure to produce a transcript of testimony given at a previous trial. In general, it is reversible error to proceed with a criminal trial in the absence of a previous trial transcript, when such contains pertinent information that should have been considered in the new trial. In these cases, a continuance is the usual remedy.17 Am Jur 2nd \\"Continuance\\", ¬ß 81 A party's failure to produce subpoenaed evidence, where the evidence is under their control, may support a request to a finder of fact for an inference that the evidence would have been unfavorable to them. Jencks Act cases In the 1957 case Jencks v. United States the United States Supreme Court ruled that a defendant must have access to government witnesses who will testify against him in a criminal trial, and must also have access to any documents pertaining to that testimony.Jencks v. United States, 355, US 657 (1957) This includes papers, documents, written statements and the like. This led to passage of the Jencks Act, 18 USC, Part II, Chapter 223, ¬ß 3500, which allows for subpoena duces tecum of relevant government documents, but only after a government agent or employee has testified at trial. There can be no pre-trial discovery. The subpoena is allowed by the trial judge. The government has the right to deny access to the documents. This may be due to the sensitive nature of the documents, or because they are classified. In such an instance, the accused is permitted to ask the court for a remedy or sanction against his accuser or plaintiff for their inability to be able to confront the papers and/or effects (i.e., material items, physical exhibits, technical analyses, lab reports, etc.) that assert or support the accusation(s) against him. A court, in law and equity, is required to answer such a request. If the accused's request is not answered in a manner that favorably restores the balance between the accused and the Government in criminal cases, or between the defendant and the plaintiff in civil cases, it is grounds for an appeal if a mistrial is not granted. The United States Supreme Court dealt with this issue in federal civil cases in United States v. Reynolds. If a remedy is granted, there is a mistrial and dismissal of criminal charges.23 Am Jur 2nd \\"Depositions and Discovery\\", ¬ß 443Jencks v. United States idem. An accused criminal has no right to subpoena the work product of the prosecution in a criminal case.23 Am Jur 2nd \\"Depositions and Discovery\\", ¬ß 444 Writ of mandamus A writ of mandamus is appropriate to compel surrender of documents in the possession of attorneys or other persons that have been illegally obtained under the abuse of a writ of attachment.Rosenthal v. Dickerman, Michigan Mandamus can vacate an order to produce books and papers.International Harvester Co. v. Eaton Circuit Judge, Michigan In an 1893 case, the United States Attorney for Alabama refused to vacate his office, refusing to surrender books, papers and other materials to the newly appointed US Attorney. The federal court in Alabama issued a writ directing the previous attorney to relinquish the documents. He, in turn, sought relief from the Supreme Court, which denied his application, saying it would not interfere with the properly conducted internal matters of a court. In the case In re: Parsons, the US Supreme Court wrote: \\"If the orders be regarded merely as directions in the administration of judicial affairs in respect of the immediate possession of property or custody of prisoners, we cannot be properly called to, by reason of anything appearing on these records, in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in this manner, to direct them to be set aside. And if the proceedings should be treated as involving a final determination as on issues joined to the right to such possession and custody, there was no complaint of want of notice or of hearing, and the summary made adopted did not in itself affect the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court upon the ground that it had exceeded its powers.\\"52 Am Jur 2nd \\"Mandamus\\" ¬ß 314 Mandamus is the remedy where a lower court has clearly failed to issue compulsion to produce documents, or to allow the petitioner access to such documents as may be in the possession of the court or the parties to the action. Mandamus can be used to compel a court to enforce an order to answer interrogatories (questions submitted by the court or one of the parties to be answered under oath and pain of perjury).Smith v. Superior Court of San Joaquin County, California88 ALR 2nd 650For mandamus as it generally applies to witnesses, see: 41 ALR 433 and 112 ALR 438 Mandamus is the proper remedy to compel the quashing of a subpoena duces tecum for the production before a grand jury of documents protected by attorney‚Äìclient privilege.Continental Oil Co. v. United States, Arizona9 ALR 3rd 1413 Presumably, this would apply to attorney work product, although there is no case law on the matter.52 Am Jur 2nd \\"Mandamus\\", ¬ß 367, Grand Juries Commitment of witness; contempt of court A witness who has refused to obey a lawful order to produce books, documents and papers may be incarcerated for contempt of court. A writ of habeas corpus will not apply unless it can be shown the witness could not have legally had possession of such documents. In such a situation the writ of habeas corpus will properly apply, and is the remedy for such improper action.Ex Parte Clarke, California39 Am Jur 2nd \\"Habeas Corpus\\", ¬ß 97 At common law, and under various statutes pertaining to a given jurisdiction, a right to action for damages, or for a statutory penalty or forfeiture, exists against a witness who, without sufficient excuse, fails or refuses to give oral testimony or to produce documents or other specified items in obedience to the command of a properly issued and served subpoena.Cases listed and discussed in 81 ALR 3rd 1297, ¬ß¬ß 3 (b), 8 (a), 9 (a) There are certain conditions precedent, or defenses, to a recovery of damages for a person's failure to testify, or to provide documents pertinent to a hearing or trial. There must be a breach of testimonial duty, after having been properly served with a legitimately executed subpoena. There must be a demonstration of actual damages incurred from the absence of testimony. Most courts have rejected the arguments for seeking damages in this kind of case. Giving false testimony in a judicial proceeding even though the allegation is made that the person giving the testimony knew it to be false, does not give rise, either at common law or by statute, to a civil action for damages resulting from such testimony. The situation is probably different if intentionally false documents are submitted under a subpoena duces tecum.Generally 61 ALR 3rd 129781 Am Jur 2nd \\"Witnesses\\", ¬ß 79 Privileges Attorney‚Äìclient privilege is generally recognized by the courts. Communications between lawyer and client are generally immune from subpoena. In other words, a lawyer cannot be compelled to testify in a trial unless the lawyer becomes, or appears to become, a party to the litigation. A similar situation exists with \\"work product\\", meaning written documents or computer records generated in preparation for a trial or hearing. This includes information such as potential questions that may be asked of witnesses, lists of possible witnesses, memoranda, notes, trial strategies, written briefs, or documents that may, or may not end up being used in the course of litigation. Usually, none of this can be the subject of a subpoena duces tecum. If a communication between lawyer and client is made in the presence of the third party, the privilege is not recognized to exist.14 ALR 3rd 59481 Am Jur 2nd Witnesses, ¬ß¬ß 172 et seq1 ALR 4th 112459 ALR 3rd 44155 ALR 3rd 132244 ALR 3rd 24 The federal courts will apply the common law rule of attorney‚Äìclient privilege unless there is an intervening state law applying to the central issues of the matter. In those cases, the federal court uses the effective state law.Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure, Rule 501 in the Federal Rules of Evidence48 ALR Fed 259 Physician‚Äìpatient privilege is usually statutorily defined, and can vary from state to state. The usual rule is that medical records are immune from subpoena if the plaintiff has not alleged physical or mental injuries or damages. Once the plaintiff alleges physical or mental injuries proximately flowing from a potentially tortious act by the defendant, or in some other disability hearing, medical records can be subject to subpoena duces tecum. While witnesses may try to resist legal discovery by asking the judge to protect them from questioning or inspection of documents, the policy of the courts is in favor of full disclosure. It is the intent of the rules of procedure that pre-trial discovery take place without any intervention of a judge. So-called \\"fishing expeditions\\" (massive and aimless calls for all documents related to the litigation) are permissible under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 (b) (1). This rule is repeated in many states' rules of procedure: \\"Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant ... if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\\" The looseness of the definition of relevant evidence is generally construed to mean \\"liberal\\" production. The physician who is the party to an action does not own the records of patients he has treated. They are not privileged if the patient has waived confidentiality. Physicians must produce medical records under subpoena duces tecum.Sharpe, Fascina and Head, \\"Law and Medicine\\", p. 5 Peer review records, and other hospital documents of quality control committee meetings are generally not subject to subpoena duces tecum, since these have statutory immunity. The theory is that the frankness of peer review would be chilled if these records could be routinely compelled.Matchett v. Superior Court, CaliforniaSharpe Fiscina and Head, \\"Law and Medicine\\" p. 69 Several United States Federal Circuit Courts have recognized a limited reporter's privilege. The United States Justice Department has a self-imposed limitation upon subpoena of reporters and their notes. This privilege is not universal, and is incomplete. Internal memos from scientific and medical journals generated in peer reviewing articles for publication are generally immune from subpoena. In some states (such as California), rape crisis counselors and domestic violence advocates hold a statutory privilege analogous to therapist‚Äìclient privilege. (See, for example, 1035 Cal. Evidence Code for rape crisis advocates,CA Codes (evid:1035-1036.2) retrieved 2009-11-26 and 1037.6 Cal. Evidence Code for domestic violence advocates).CA Codes (evid:1037-1037.8) However, these privileges are not absolute, and may be overruled by a judge upon a showing that \\"the probative value of the information outweighs the effect of disclosure of the information on the victim, the counseling relationship, and the counseling services\\", or under a number of other limited circumstances. To respect and preserve the privacy of sensitive material contained in such reports, the judge may require the disclosure of confidential information to take place in camera. So called \\"priest‚Äìpenitent\\" privilege, which precludes forced testimony of confessions made to a priest, minister, or religious adviser are statutorily defined in the United States. They vary between states. In some cases, the privilege is confusing and ill-defined. In others, there is recognized stare decisis. (See: priest‚Äìpenitent privilege, confessional privilege (United States), spousal privilege, executive privilege, reporter's privilege.) Pre- and post- judgment execution proceedings Discovery can be authorized for the production of documents for both pre-trial and post-trial actions. Most states either follow, or have modeled their procedures after, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 69(a). Judgment creditors (those who have received a favorable court ruling for monetary damages) are permitted to ask questions about a debtor's residence; recent employment history; business relationships, including partners, co-shareholders, co-officers, co-directors; the contents of a will; transfers of property; and the identity of persons who either owed a debt to the judgment debtor, or received things of value from the debtor. Information in bank accounts can also be the subject of a subpoena duces tecum.General case law is reviewed in 30 Am Jur 2nd \\"Executions, Etc.\\", ¬ß¬ß 720 and 714 In federal court proceedings concerning judgment debtors, the inquiry is usually limited to the discovery of assets.

However, the right is not absolute and may be denied when the entity seeking to view the records has an improper purpose. The general intent of the statute is to favor public access to court documents.9 Am Jur 2nd \\"Bankruptcy\\", ¬ß 829 Production of documents in bankruptcy An entity (person or a corporation) may be compelled to produce documentary evidence in accordance with the subpoena powers of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 as applied by Bankruptcy Rule 9016. The United States Bankruptcy Court has powers to compel production of documents from a non-debtor corporation or person concerning transactions involving the debtor corporation or person. Production of documents can be challenged as being burdensome. Assets diverted to outside corporations or bank accounts/stock portfolios and such other assets as land holdings lie within the power to compel production under subpoena duces tecum. Federal law recognizes no accountant-client privilege. A subpoena duce tecum served pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 2004 is not a violation of accountant- client privilege. 11 United States Code section 107 (a) provides that papers filed in cases under the Bankruptcy Code and dockets of the Bankruptcy Courts are public records and are to be open to examination at reasonable times without charge.9 Am Jur 2nd \\"Bankruptcy\\", sections 828-829 Compelling a foreign corporation to produce documents A domestic corporation may be considered to be a \\"person\\" within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. It is not necessary to treat a corporation as a person in all circumstances. United States case law is confusing concerning this matter when dealing with foreign corporations, and their operation within the United States. Especially troubling have been rulings concerning the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. A foreign agent may not claim Fifth Amendment provisions against self-incrimination. Nor can records be withheld from subpoena duces tecum on the grounds that production of such documents would incriminate officers or other members of the foreign corporation. However, there is case authority in which foreign corporations have been protected from illegal searches and seizures, including documents and books.See case law: 120 ALR 1103 The matter of a foreign corporation operating as a \\"person\\" within the United States being afforded protection under the Fourteenth Amendment is discussed.49 ALR 73277 ALR 149036 Am Jur 2nd \\"Foreign Corporations\\", ¬ß¬ß 44 and 45 Subpoena of welfare documents Statutes governing the disclosure of information contained in welfare records exist in many jurisdictions. The rationale for the existence of these regulations is to encourage full and frank disclosure by the welfare recipient of his situation and the protection of the recipient from the embarrassment likely to result from the disclosure of information contained in such records.54 ALR 3rd 768, ¬ß 24 In some states, records can be disclosed at the discretion of the state director of welfare. In general, welfare records are not public records, and should not be considered to be such. Disclosure of information is usually limited to purposes directly connected with the administration of welfare benefits. The investigation of costs of welfare programs have been held to be sufficiently related to the matters in question to justify disclosure. Statutes designed to limit welfare record availability are generally held by the courts to be not immune from the power of subpoena duces tecum. Certain state laws limit the availability of information that can be obtained from the subpoena of such documents. These are always subject to a court challenge, on a case by case basis. Welfare recipients are generally allowed access to their files, by subpoena duces tecum. Death of a welfare recipient is considered in some states to be sufficient reason to remove the reason for confidentiality. Some states have passed so-called \\"Right to Know\\" statutes, which would make welfare recipients and the information available to the public. These, along with common law, and state and federal constitutions guaranteeing freedom of the press do not give newspapers (or other news media) the right to access the names of persons on welfare, or the amounts they receive.79 Am Jur 2nd, \\"Welfare\\", ¬ß 50 Federal Trade Commission hearings in monopoly actions Whenever the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has reason to believe that any person has violated 15 USC section 13, 14, 18 or 19, it must issue and serve on that person and on the Attorney General of the United States, a complaint stating its charges in that regard. The notice shall also give a date for a hearing in the matter. Delivery of the subpoena duces tecum for production of documents may be done in person, or by certified letter. Receipt of the letter is considered proof of service.54 Am Jur 2nd \\"Monopolies\\", ¬ß 394 Power to issue subpoenas is extended to Robinson‚ÄìPatman Act cases of price-fixing and Clayton Act cases of unlawful acquisition.54 Am Jur 2nd \\"Monopolies\\", ¬ß 398-399 A Federal District Court lacks jurisdiction to enjoin the Federal Trade Commission from proceeding in an investigation. It cannot stay (stop) a subpoena duces tecum to produce documents in the investigative stage. An injunction by a federal court does not have the power to restrain the FTC from enforcing an order requiring corporations to furnish reports and documents un 15 USC ¬ß 49. The only relief available to stop a demand for documents is to seek an action of compliance in mandamus by the Attorney General of the United States, or under 15 USC ¬ß 50 to enforce fines and forfeitures.54 Am Jur 2nd \\"Monopolies\\", ¬ß 862 If the FTC institutes an adjudicative proceeding (a hearing), the person who originated the matter by complaining to the FTC is not a party to the action and does not have any control over it. The FTC may allow the complaining person to participate in the proceeding by virtue of 15 USC, section 45. This allows participation for good cause, either by counsel (lawyer) or in person. You cannot intervene in an FTC hearing, except by demonstrating that substantial issues of law or fact would not be properly raised and arguedand that these issues are important and immediate enough to warrant additional expenditure of FTC resources. This involvement can be enhanced by subpoena duces tecum. Pre-hearing conferences are the norm. These are useful in: * Clarifying or simplifying issues * Amending pleadings * Entering stipulations, admissions of fact, and contents and authenticity of documents * Expediting discovery and presentation of evidence, including restriction of witnesses * Matters subject to official notice that may be resolved by further production of documents related to the case In general, pre-hearing conferences are not public.55 Am Jur 2nd, ¬ß 836 The FTC is not restricted by a rigid rule of evidence.55 Am Jur 2nd, ¬ß 840 Subpoena of medical records Administrative law Disabled persons under the age of 65 years can be eligible for disability benefits under Social Security Titles II and XVI.70 A Am Jur 2nd \\"Social Security and Medicare\\", sections 468 et seq The seminal case in Social Security law is Richardson v. Perales, a Supreme Court decision from 1971. The court directed that medical reports put forth by a treating physician in Social Security hearings should be accepted as evidence, despite the hearsay nature of the medical records. These should be accepted, even if cross-examination is not available. The claimant has the right to subpoena the treating physician. In cases of conflicting medical evidence, it is not unconstitutional for the hearing officer to obtain independent medical advice to help resolve the physical questions involved. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, hearsay in the form of medical records are admissible up to the point of relevancy.Richardson v. Perales, US Supreme Court, 1971 Several federal agencies have adopted Jencks Act rules. Although the Jencks Act applies only to government agents or employees who testify in criminal cases, making these witnesses and relevant documents available for cross-examination after testimony, it has been applied in administrative law cases in the interests of justice and fair play.Fairback v.

When oral testimony is taken from physicians, the usual standard is to state an opinion \\"within a reasonable degree of medical certainty\\".Malone, Plant and Little, \\"Worker's Compensation and Employment Rights\\", pp.288-29121 ALR 3rd 912 Worker's compensation laws are dictated by state statute or Federal Employers Liability Act.Malone, Platt and Little, p. 879 et seq In many states, the employer has the right to demand an independent examination and can also direct treatment be carried out by certain physicians.82 Am Jur 2nd \\"Workers' Compensation\\", ¬ß¬ß 504 et seq Mandatory reporting of child abuse In the landmark 1976 California case of Landeros v. Flood,17 Cal 3d, 399, 131 Cal rptr 69, 551 P2d, 389 the California Supreme Court remanded a case to the trial court for action in tort against a treating physician for failure to report suspected child abuse.97 ALR 3rd 324Sharpe, Fiscina and Head, p. 48 The theory at trial was that the plaintiff, a child of about 12 months of age, had been returned to a home where further physical abuse occurred, causing more damages. This was because the physician had failed to report the abuse in violation of California law. After this case, all states instituted mandatory reporting by physicians and other medical personnel of any suspected child abuse or neglect cases. In general, reporting in good faith shields the physician or health care worker from tort liability. Reporting to police or social services necessitates obtaining medical records by subpoena duces tecum. This case, and legislation that followed it were in response to several articles that appeared in the medical literature that defined battered child syndrome and child abuse syndrome.See: Caffey, Kempe references The 1962 Social Security AmendmentsPub. L. No. 87-543 require each state to make child welfare services available throughout the state to all children and provide coordination between child welfare services (Title IV-B) and social services provided under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Act (ADC, later known as AFDC; now called Title XX) Determinations in these cases frequently require production of medical records. In 1972, Congressional hearings began on child abuse and neglect. In response, Congress passed the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act,Pub. L. No. 93-247 which defined abuse as \\"physical or mental injury, negligent treatment, or maltreatment of a child under the age of 18 by a person who is responsible for the child's welfare under circumstances which would indicate that the child's health or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby\\". The legislation created the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect as an information clearinghouse. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1974 ( - ) defined \\"child abuse and neglect\\" as \\"physical or mental injury, sexual abuse, negligent treatment, or maltreatment of a child under the age of eighteen by a person responsible for the child's welfare under circumstances which indicate that the child's health or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby.\\"3 Proof of Facts, p.265 et seq The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1988Pub. L. No. 100-294 when enacted, expanded the definition of abuse. Sexual crimes were specifically identified in Sex Crimes Against Children Act of 1995Pub. L. No. 104-71 These laws have made child abuse a federal crime, and routinely mandate production of medical records.2 Proof of Facts 2nd 365 et seqLanderos v.

Many jurisdictions have mandatory reporting laws requiring treating physicians or other medical personnel to report any suspicious injury to police or other appropriate authorities. These requirements may be imposed by statute, ordinance or regulation. Some of these may be limited to wounds typically inflicted by gun or knife. There may be similar reporting requirements in cases of domestic violence. These statutes have been generally upheld to constitutional challenges. Reporting of such cases usually voids any challenge to subpoena duces tecum of the medical records by police or state authorities.85 ALR 3rd 1196 Peer review records in medical licensing and hospital credential actions The issue of removal of a doctor from a hospital staff, or revoking or limiting a license to practice medicine usually involve various state and federal immunities. The Healthcare Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA) of 1986 granted doctors sitting on peer review committees immunity from subpoena duces tecum, or liability for the revocation of hospital privileges of other doctors. The matters of peer review cannot, in the normal course of events, be the subject of a subpoena duces tecum. This has led to claims that powerful doctors can abuse the process to punish other doctors for reasons unrelated to medical issues (termed \\"sham peer review\\"). The American Medical Association conducted a probe of the sham peer review issue and found that no pervasive problem exists. Allegations of sham peer review are easy to make (for example, by doctors whose medical mistakes have made them targets of peer review), but actual infractions are rare.\\"Inappropriate Peer Review. Report of the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association.\\" Opponents of peer review counter that the sparcity of successful challenges is indicative of how widespread the problem is and how difficult these actions are to win.

BioJava supports a huge range of data, starting from DNA and protein sequences to the level of 3D protein structures. The BioJava libraries are useful for automating many daily and mundane bioinformatics tasks such as to parsing a Protein Data Bank (PDB) file, interacting with Jmol and many more. This application programming interface (API) provides various file parsers, data models and algorithms to facilitate working with the standard data formats and enables rapid application development and analysis. Additional projects from BioJava include rcsb-sequenceviewer, biojava-http, biojava-spark, and rcsb-viewers. Features BioJava provides software modules for many of the typical tasks of bioinformatics programming. These include: * Accessing nucleotide and peptide sequence data from local and remote databases * Transforming formats of database/ file records * Protein structure parsing and manipulation * Manipulating individual sequences * Searching for similar sequences * Creating and manipulating sequence alignments  History and publications The BioJava project grew out of work by Thomas Down and Matthew Pocock to create an API to simplify development of Java-based Bioinformatics tools. BioJava is an active open source project that has been developed over more than 12 years and by more than 60 developers. BioJava is one of a number of Bio* projects designed to reduce code duplication. Examples of such projects that fall under Bio* apart from BioJava are BioPython, BioPerl, BioRuby, EMBOSS etc. In October 2012, the first paper on BioJava was published. This paper detailed BioJava's modules, functionalities, and purpose. As of November 2018 Google Scholar counts more than 130 citations. The most recent paper on BioJava was written in February 2017. This paper detailed a new tool named BioJava-ModFinder. This tool can be used for identification and subsequent mapping of protein modifications to 3D in the Protein Data Bank (PBD). The package was also integrated with the RCSB PDB web application and added protein modification annotations to the sequence diagram and structure display. More than 30,000 structures with protein modifications were identified by using BioJava- ModFinder and can be found on the RCSB PDB website. In the year 2008, BioJava's first Application note was published. It was migrated from its original CVS repository to Git hub in April 2013. The project has been moved to a separate repository, BioJava-legacy, and is still maintained for minor changes and bug fixes.BioJava-legacy Version 3 was released in December 2010. It was a major update to the prior versions. The aim of this release was to rewrite BioJava so that it could be modularized into small, reusable components. This allowed developers to contribute more easily and reduced dependencies. The new approach seen in BioJava 3 was modeled after the Apache Commons. Version 4 was released in January 2015. This version brought many new features and improvements to the packages biojava-core, biojava-structure, biojava-structure-gui, biojava-phylo, as well as others. BioJava 4.2.0 was the first release to be available using Maven from the Maven Central. Version 5 was released in March 2018. This represents a major milestone for the project. BioJava 5.0.0 is the first released based on Java 8 which introduces the use of lambda functions and streaming API calls. There were also major changes to biojava-structure module. Also, the previous data models for macro-molecular structures have been adapted to more closely represent the mmCIF data model. This was the first release in over two years. Some of the other improvements include optimizations in the biojava-structure module to improve symmetry detection and added support for MMTF formats. Other general improvements include Javadoc updates, dependency versions, and all tests are now Junit4. The release contains 1,170 commits from 19 contributors. Modules During 2014-2015, large parts of the original code base were rewritten. BioJava 3 is a clear departure from the version 1 series. It now consists of several independent modules built using an automation tool called Apache Maven. These modules provide state-of-the-art tools for protein structure comparison, pairwise and multiple sequence alignments, working with DNA and protein sequences, analysis of amino acid properties, detecting protein modifications, predicting disordered regions in proteins, and parsers for common file formats using a biologically meaningful data model. The original code has been moved into a separate BioJava legacy project, which is still available for backward compatibility.BioJava legacy project BioJava 5 introduced new features to two modules, biojava-alignment and biojava-structure. The following sections will describe several of the new modules and highlight some of the new features that are included in the latest version of BioJava. 1292x1292px Core Module This module provides Java classes to model amino acid or nucleotide sequences. The classes were designed so that the names are familiar and make sense to biologists and also provide a concrete representation of the steps in going from a gene sequence to a protein sequence for computer scientists and programmers. A major change between the legacy BioJava project and BioJava3 lies in the way framework has been designed to exploit then-new innovations in Java. A sequence is defined as a generic interface allowing the rest of the modules to create any utility that operates on all sequences. Specific classes for common sequences such as DNA and proteins have been defined in order to improve usability for biologists. The translation engine really leverages this work by allowing conversions between DNA, RNA and amino acid sequences. This engine can handle details such as choosing the codon table, converting start codons to methionine, trimming stop codons, specifying the reading frame and handing ambiguous sequences. Special attention has been paid to designing the storage of sequences to minimize space needs. Special design patterns such as the Proxy pattern allowed the developers to create the framework such that sequences can be stored in memory, fetched on demand from a web service such as UniProt, or read from a FASTA file as needed. The latter two approaches save memory by not loading sequence data until it is referenced in the application. This concept can be extended to handle very large genomic datasets, such as NCBI GenBank or a proprietary database. Protein structure modules This window shows two proteins with IDs \\"4hhb.A\\" and \\"4hhb.B\\" aligned against each other. The code is given on the left side. This is produced using BioJava libraries which in turn uses Jmol viewer.Hanson, R.M. (2010) Jmol a paradigm shift in crystallographic visualization. The FATCAT rigid algorithm is used here to do the alignment. The protein structure modules provide tools to represent and manipulate 3D biomolecular structures. They focus on protein structure comparison. The following algorithms have been implemented and included in BioJava. * FATCAT algorithm for flexible and rigid body alignment. * The standard Combinatorial Extension (CE) algorithm. * A new version of CE that can detect circular permutations in proteins. These algorithms are used to provide the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) Protein Comparison Tool as well as systematic comparisons of all proteins in the PDB on a weekly basis. Parsers for PDB and mmCIFFitzgerald, P.M.D. et al. (2006) Macromolecular dictionary (mmCIF). In Hall, S.R. file formats allow the loading of structure data into a reusable data model. This feature is used by the SIFTS project to map between UniProt sequences and PDB structures. Information from the RCSB PDB can be dynamically fetched without the need to manually download data. For visualization, an interface to the 3D viewer Jmol is provided. Genome and Sequencing modules This module is focused on the creation of gene sequence objects from the core module. This is realized by supporting the parsing of the following popular standard file formats generated by open source gene prediction applications: * GTF files generated by GeneMark * GFF2 files generated by GeneID * GFF3 files generated by Glimmer Then the gene sequence objects are written out as a GFF3 format and is imported into GMOD. These file formats are well defined but what gets written in the file is very flexible. For providing input-output support for several common variants of the FASTQ file format from the next generation sequencers, a separate sequencing module is provided. For samples on how to use this module please go to this link. Alignment module This module contains several classes and methods that allow users to perform pairwise and multiple sequence alignment. Sequences can be aligned in both a single and multi- threaded fashion. BioJava implements the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for optimal global alignments and the Smith and Waterman's algorithm for local alignments. The outputs of both local and global alignments are available in standard formats. In addition to these two algorithms, there is an implementation of Guan‚ÄìUberbacher algorithm which performs global sequence alignment very efficiently since it only uses linear memory. For Multiple Sequence Alignment, any of the methods discussed above can be used to progressively perform a multiple sequence alignment. ModFinder module An example application using the ModFinder module and the protein structure module. Protein modifications are mapped onto the sequence and structure of ferredoxin I (PDB ID 1GAO). Two possible iron‚Äìsulfur clusters are shown on the protein sequence (3Fe‚Äì4S (F3S): orange triangles/lines; 4Fe‚Äì4S (SF4): purple diamonds/ lines). The 4Fe‚Äì4S cluster is displayed in the Jmol structure window above the sequence display The ModFinder module provides new methods to identify and classify protein modifications in protein 3D structures. Over 400 different types of protein modifications such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, disulfide bonds metal chelation etc. were collected and curated based on annotations in PSI-MOD, RESID and RCSB PDB. The module also provides an API for detecting pre-, co-, and post-translational protein modifications within protein structures. This module can also identify phosphorylation and print all pre-loaded modifications from a structure. Amino acid properties module This module attempts to provide accurate physio-chemical properties of proteins. The properties that can calculated using this module are as follows: *Molecular mass *Extinction coefficient *Instability index *Aliphatic index *Grand average of hydropathy *Isoelectric point *Amino acid composition The precise molecular weights for common isotopically labelled amino acids are included in this module. There also exists flexibility to define new amino acid molecules with their molecular weights using simple XML configuration files. This can be useful where the precise mass is of high importance such as mass spectrometry experiments. Protein disorder module The goal of this module is to provide users ways to find disorders in protein molecules. BioJava includes a Java implementation of the RONN predictor. The BioJava 3.0.5 makes use of Java's support for multithreading to improve performance by up to 3.2 times, on a modern quad-core machine, as compared to the legacy C implementation. There are two ways to use this module: *Using library function calls *Using command line Some features of this module include: * Calculating the probability of disorder for every residue in a sequence * Calculating the probability of disorder for every residue in the sequence for all proteins from a FASTA input file * Get the disordered regions of the protein for a single protein sequence or for all the proteins from a FASTA input file Web service access module As per the current trends in bioinformatics, web based tools are gaining popularity. The web service module allows bioinformatics services to be accessed using REST protocols. Currently, two services are implemented: NCBI Blast through the Blast URLAPI (previously known as QBlast) and the HMMER web service.  Comparisons with other alternatives  The need for customized software in the field of bioinformatics has been addressed by several groups and individuals. Similar to BioJava, open-source software projects such as BioPerl, BioPython, and BioRuby all provide tool-kits with multiple functionality that make it easier to create customized pipelines or analysis. As the names suggest, the projects mentioned above use different programming languages. All of these APIs offer similar tools so on what criteria should one base their choice? For programmers who are experienced in only one of these languages, the choice is straightforward. However, for a well-rounded bioinformaticist who knows all of these languages and wants to choose the best language for a job, the choice can be made based on the following guidelines given by a software review done on the Bio* tool-kits. In general, for small programs (<500 lines) that will be used by only an individual or small group, it is hard to beat Perl and BioPerl. These constraints probably cover the needs of 90 per cent of personal bioinformatics programming. For beginners, and for writing larger programs in the Bio domain, especially those to be shared and supported by others, Python‚Äôs clarity and brevity make it very attractive. For those who might be leaning towards a career in bioinformatics and who want to learn only one language, Java has the widest general programming support, very good support in the Bio domain with BioJava, and is now the de facto language of business (the new COBOL, for better or worse). Apart from these Bio* projects there is another project called STRAP which uses Java and aims for similar goals. The STRAP-toolbox, similar to BioJava is also a Java-toolkit for the design of Bioinformatics programs and scripts. The similarities and differences between BioJava and STRAP are as follows: Similarities * Both provide comprehensive collections of methods for protein sequences. * Both are used by Java programmers to code bioinformatics algorithms. * Both separate implementations and definitions by using java interfaces. * Both are open source projects. * Both can read and write many sequence file formats. Differences * BioJava is applicable to nucleotide and peptide sequences and can be applied for entire genomes. STRAP cannot cope with single sequences as long as an entire chromosome. Instead STRAP manipulates peptide sequences and 3D- structures of the size of single proteins. Nevertheless, it can hold a high number of sequences and structures in memory. STRAP is designed for protein sequences but can read coding nucleotide files, which are then translated to peptide sequences. * STRAP is very fast since the graphical user interface must be highly responsive. BioJava is used where speed is less critical. * BioJava is well designed in terms of type safety, ontology and object design. BioJava uses objects for sequences, annotations and sequence positions. Even single amino acids or nucleotides are object references. To enhance speed, STRAP avoids frequent object instantiations and invocation of non-final object- methods. In BioJava peptide sequences and nucleotide sequences are lists of symbols. The symbols can be retrieved one after the other with an iterator or sub-sequences can be obtained. The advantages are that the entire sequence does not necessarily reside in memory and that programs are less susceptible to programming errors. Symbol objects are immutable elements of an alphabet. In STRAP however simple byte arrays are used for sequences and float arrays for coordinates. Besides speed the low memory consumption is an important advantage of basic data types. Classes in Strap expose internal data. Therefore, programmers might commit programming errors like manipulating byte arrays directly instead of using the setter methods. Another disadvantage is that no checks are performed in STRAP whether the characters in sequences are valid with respect to an underlying alphabet. In BioJava sequence positions are realized by the class Location. Discontiguous Location objects are composed of several contiguous RangeLocation objects or PointLocation objects. For the class StrapProtein however, single residue positions are indicated by integer numbers between 0 and countResidues()-1. Multiple positions are given by boolean arrays. True at a given index means selected whereas false means not selected. * BioJava throws exceptions when methods are invoked with invalid parameters. STRAP avoids the time-consuming creation of Throwable objects. Instead, errors in methods are indicated by the return values NaN, -1 or null. From the point of program design however Throwable objects are nicer. * In BioJava a Sequence object is either a peptide sequence or a nucleotide sequence. A StrapProtein can hold both at the same time if a coding nucleotide sequence was read and translated into protein. Both, the nucleotide sequence and the peptide sequence are contained in the same StrapProtein object. The coding or non-coding regions can be changed and the peptide sequence alters accordingly.  Projects using BioJava  The following projects make use of BioJava. * Metabolic Pathway Builder: Software suite dedicated to the exploration of connections among genes, proteins, reactions and metabolic pathways * DengueInfo: a Dengue genome information portal that uses BioJava in the middleware and talks to a biosql database. * Dazzle: A BioJava based DAS server. * BioSense: A plug-in for the InforSense Suite, an analytics software platform by IDBS that unitizes BioJava. * Bioclipse: A free, open source, workbench for chemo- and bioinformatics with powerful editing and visualizing abilities for molecules, sequences, proteins, spectra, etc. * PROMPT: A free, open source framework and application for the comparison and mapping of protein sets.

It has played an integral role in the Human Genome Project. Background BioPerl is an active open source software project supported by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation. The first set of Perl codes of BioPerl was created by Tim Hubbard and Jong Bhak at MRC Centre Cambridge, where the first genome sequencing was carried out by Fred Sanger. MRC Centre was one of the hubs and birth places of modern bioinformatics as it had a large quantity of DNA sequences and 3D protein structures. Hubbard was using the th_lib.pl Perl library, which contained many useful Perl subroutines for bioinformatics. Bhak, Hubbard's first PhD student, created jong_lib.pl. Bhak merged the two Perl subroutine libraries into Bio.pl. The name BioPerl was coined jointly by Bhak and Steven Brenner at the Centre for Protein Engineering (CPE). In 1995, Brenner organized a BioPerl session at the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference, held in Cambridge. BioPerl had some users in coming months including Georg Fuellen who organized a training course in Germany. Fuellen's colleagues and students greatly extended BioPerl; this was further expanded by others, including Steve Chervitz who was actively developing Perl codes for his yeast genome database. The major expansion came when Cambridge student Ewan Birney joined the development team. The first stable release was on 11 June 2002; the most recent stable (in terms of API) release is 1.7.2 from 07 September 2017. There are also developer releases produced periodically. Version series 1.7.x is considered to be the most stable (in terms of bugs) version of BioPerl and is recommended for everyday use. In order to take advantage of BioPerl, the user needs a basic understanding of the Perl programming language including an understanding of how to use Perl references, modules, objects and methods. Influence on the Human Genome Project The Human Genome Project faced several challenges during its lifetime. A few of these problems were solved when many of the genomics labs started to use Perl. The process of analyzing all of the DNA sequences was one such problem. Some labs built large monolithic systems with complex relational databases that took forever to debug and implement, and got surpassed by new technologies. Other labs learned to build modular, loosely-coupled systems whose parts could be swapped in and out when new technologies arose. Many of the initial results from all of the labs were mixed. It was eventually discovered that many of the steps could be implemented as loosely coupled programs that were run with a Perl shell script. Another problem that was fixed was interchange of data. Each lab usually had different programs that they ran with their scripts, resulting in several conversions when comparing results. To fix this the labs collectively started using a super-set of data. One script was used to convert from super- set to each lab's set and one was used to convert back. This minimized the number of scripts needed and data exchange became simplified with Perl. Features and examples BioPerl provides software modules for many of the typical tasks of bioinformatics programming. These include: * Accessing nucleotide and peptide sequence data from local and remote databases Example of accessing GenBank to retrieve a sequence: use Bio::DB::GenBank; $db_obj = Bio::DB::GenBank->new; $seq_obj = $db_obj->get_Seq_by_acc( # Insert Accession Number ); * Transforming formats of database/ file records Example code for transforming formats use Bio::SeqIO; my $usage = \\"all2y.pl informat outfile outfileformat\\"; my $informat = shift or die $usage; my $outfile = shift or die $usage; my $outformat = shift or die $usage; my $seqin = Bio::SeqIO->new( -fh => *STDIN, -format => $informat, ); my $seqout = Bio::SeqIO->new( -file => \\">$outfile\\", -format => $outformat, ); while (my $inseq = $seqin->next_seq) { $seqout->write_seq($inseq); } * Manipulating individual sequences Example of gathering statistics for a given sequence use Bio::Tools::SeqStats; $seq_stats = Bio::Tools::SeqStats->new($seqobj); $weight = $seq_stats->get_mol_wt(); $monomer_ref = $seq_stats->count_monomers(); # for nucleic acid sequence $codon_ref = $seq_stats->count_codons(); * Searching for similar sequences * Creating and manipulating sequence alignments * Searching for genes and other structures on genomic DNA * Developing machine readable sequence annotations Usage In addition to being used directly by end-users, BioPerl has also provided the base for a wide variety of bioinformatic tools, including amongst others: * SynBrowse * GeneComber * TFBS * MIMOX * BioParser * Degenerate primer design * Querying the public databases * Current Comparative Table New tools and algorithms from external developers are often integrated directly into BioPerl itself: * Dealing with phylogenetic trees and nested taxa * FPC Web tools Advantages BioPerl was one of the first biological module repositories that increased its usability. It has very easy to install modules, along with a flexible global repository. BioPerl uses good test modules for a large variety of processes. Disadvantages There are many ways to use BioPerl, from simple scripting to very complex object programming. This makes the language not clear and sometimes hard to understand. For as many modules that BioPerl has, some do not always work the way they are intended.

Á®ÆÂ≠ê shuji) (Chinese ÁßçÂ≠ê zh«íng z«ê), literally seed, is used as a metaphor for the origin or cause of things and cognate with bindu. The Om bija in Esoteric Buddhism Buddhist theory of karmic seeds Various schools of Buddhist thought held that karmic effects arose out of seeds that were latent in an individual's mindstream or psycho-physical continuum.Fukuda, Takumi. BHADANTA RAMA: A SAUTRANTIKA BEFORE VASUBANDHU, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 26 Number 2 2003. Rupert Gethin describes the theory thus: > When I perform an action motivated by greed, it plants a 'seed' in the > series of dharmas [phenomena] that is my mind. Such a seed is not a thing in > itself - a dharma but merely the modification or 'perfuming' of the > subsequent flow of dharmas consequent upon the action. In the course of time > this modification matures and issues in a particular result, in the same way > as a seed does not produce its fruit immediately, but only after the > 'modifications' of the shoot, stem, leaf, and flower.Gethin, Rupert. The > Foundations of Buddhism, page 222. The Sautrantika school held such a theory as did the Mahasamghikas and the early Mahasisakas.Lamotte; Pruden. Karmasiddhiprakarana, 1987, page 28. The Sautrantika Sthavira Srilata held a conception of \\"subsidiary element\\" (anudhatu or *purvanudhatu) which also corresponds to this theory of seeds. The seed theory was defended by the Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu in his Abhidharmakosha who mentions that is the view of the ‚Äúold teachers‚Äù (purvacarya).< It is also present in the Viniscayasamgrahani of the Yogacarabhumi.Kritzer, Robert. SAUTRANTIKA IN THE ABHIDHARMAKOSABHASYA In the Bashyam Vasubandhu connects the Sautrantika theory of seeds with the notion of the latent defilements or anusaya: > The Sautrantikas define anusayas as kleshas in the state of seeds and say > that they are not separate dravyas (substances). Anusayas are dormant, i.e., > not actualized, while paryavasthanas (active defilements) are > awakened.Kritzer, Robert. SAUTRANTIKA IN THE ABHIDHARMAKOSABHASYA, page 364 Likewise, the Nyayanusara of Sanghabhadra states that the theory had different terms to refer to \\"seeds\\": > There are certain masters who give different names to these seeds, each > according to his own understanding. Some call them subsidiary elements > (anudhatu), others call them impressions (vasana); still others call them > capability (samarthya), non-disappearance (avipranasa), or accumulation > (upacaya). The theory is considerably extended in the Consciousness-only teachings of the Yogacara school of Buddhism. According to this theory, all experiences and actions produce bƒ´ja as impressions, stored in the alaya (storehouse) consciousness. The external world is produced when the seeds \\"perfume\\" this consciousness. In Tantra In Vajrayana Buddhism and Hinduism, the term bƒ´ja is used for mystical \\"seed syllables\\" contained within mantras. These seeds do not have precise meanings, but are thought to carry connections to spiritual principles. The best-known bƒ´ja syllable is Om, first found in the Hindu scriptures the Upanishads. Khanna (2003: p. 21) links mantras and yantras to thoughtforms: In some tantric traditions, the Bija of the 'Varnamala' (Sanskrit; English: \\"garland of letters\\"; which may be rendered as alphabet) are understood as aniconic representations and sound embodiments of the matrikas (a group of goddesses). In Tibetan Buddhism the seed syllables corresponding to the Three Vajras are: a white o·πÉ (enlightened body), a red ƒÅ·∏• (enlightened speech) and a blue h≈´·πÉ (enlightened mind). In the B√∂n tradition of Tibet, it's a little different: a white ƒÅ·∏•, a red o·πÉ and a blue h≈´·πÉ. Bijas are often the vehicle of esoteric transmission of terma to a 'tert√∂n' (Tibetan; English: \\"revealer of terma\\"), such as that experienced by Dudjom Lingpa.*Lingpa, Dudjom; Tulku, Chagdud; Norbu, Padma Drimed; Barron, Richard (Lama Ch√∂kyi Nyima, translator); Fairclough, Susanne (translator) (1994, 2002 revised).

Revised Edition. Junction City, CA, USA: Padma Publishing. p.xx Cross cultural correlates Guruwari of the Indigenous Australian peoples is an interesting cross cultural correlate and may be cognate. See also gankyil of the Vajrayana tradition which is cognate with bindu. In the respected fieldwork published in Aboriginal Men of High Degree, A.P. Elkin cites what he in his professional opinion is evidence that traders from Indonesia brought fleeting contact of Buddhism and Hinduism to areas near modern-day Dampier.Elkin, A.P.. Aboriginal Men of High Degree: Initiation and Sorcery in the World's Oldest Tradition. 1973. Inner Traditions, 1994. Traditions of Mantrayana were also evident in Indonesia, e.g. Candi Sukuh. And it is in the Vajrayana and Mantrayana traditions of esoteric transmission where bija take precedence. Indeed, bija defines Mantrayana. Elkin interpreted a link between Indigenous Australian culture and Buddhist ideas such as reincarnation. He argued this link could have been brought through contact with Macassan traders. There was also speculation due to reports of Chinese relics appearing in northern Australia dating to the 15th century, although it may have been brought much later through trade rather than earlier exploration. Elkin cited linguistic commonalities of certain far northern Australian indigenous words and lexical items and ancient southern Indian Dravidian languages. There are also documented analogues and marked similarities in their kinship systems.

It contains classes to represent biological sequences and sequence annotations, and it is able to read and write to a variety of file formats. It also allows for a programmatic means of accessing online databases of biological information, such as those at NCBI. Separate modules extend Biopython's capabilities to sequence alignment, protein structure, population genetics, phylogenetics, sequence motifs, and machine learning. Biopython is one of a number of Bio* projects designed to reduce code duplication in computational biology.  History  Biopython development began in 1999 and it was first released in July 2000. It was developed during a similar time frame and with analogous goals to other projects that added bioinformatics capabilities to their respective programming languages, including BioPerl, BioRuby and BioJava. Early developers on the project included Jeff Chang, Andrew Dalke and Brad Chapman, though over 100 people have made contributions to date. In 2007, a similar Python project, namely PyCogent, was established. The initial scope of Biopython involved accessing, indexing and processing biological sequence files. While this is still a major focus, over the following years added modules have extended its functionality to cover additional areas of biology (see Key features and examples). As of version 1.62, Biopython supports running on Python 3 as well as Python 2.  Design  Wherever possible, Biopython follows the conventions used by the Python programming language to make it easier for users familiar with Python. For example, \`Seq\` and \`SeqRecord\` objects can be manipulated via slicing, in a manner similar to Python‚Äôs strings and lists. It is also designed to be functionally similar to other Bio* projects, such as BioPerl. Biopython is able to read and write most common file formats for each of its functional areas, and its license is permissive and compatible with most other software licenses, which allow Biopython to be used in a variety of software projects.  Key features and examples   Sequences  A core concept in Biopython is the biological sequence, and this is represented by the \`Seq\` class. A Biopython \`Seq\` object is similar to a Python string in many respects: it supports the Python slice notation, can be concatenated with other sequences and is immutable. In addition, it includes sequence-specific methods and specifies the particular biological alphabet used. >>> # This script creates a DNA sequence and performs some typical manipulations >>> from Bio.Seq import Seq >>> from Bio.Alphabet import IUPAC >>> dna_sequence = Seq('AGGCTTCTCGTA', IUPAC.unambiguous_dna) >>> dna_sequence Seq('AGGCTTCTCGTA', IUPACUnambiguousDNA()) >>> dna_sequence[2:7] Seq('GCTTC', IUPACUnambiguousDNA()) >>> dna_sequence.reverse_complement() Seq('TACGAGAAGCCT', IUPACUnambiguousDNA()) >>> rna_sequence = dna_sequence.transcribe() >>> rna_sequence Seq('AGGCUUCUCGUA', IUPACUnambiguousRNA()) >>> rna_sequence.translate() Seq('RLLV', IUPACProtein())  Sequence annotation  The \`SeqRecord\` class describes sequences, along with information such as name, description and features in the form of \`SeqFeature\` objects. Each \`SeqFeature\` object specifies the type of the feature and its location. Feature types can be ‚Äògene‚Äô, ‚ÄòCDS‚Äô (coding sequence), ‚Äòrepeat_region‚Äô, ‚Äòmobile_element‚Äô or others, and the position of features in the sequence can be exact or approximate. >>> # This script loads an annotated sequence from file and views some of its contents. >>> from Bio import SeqIO >>> seq_record = SeqIO.read('pTC2.gb', 'genbank') >>> seq_record.name 'NC_019375' >>> seq_record.description 'Providencia stuartii plasmid pTC2, complete sequence.' >>> seq_record.features[14] SeqFeature(FeatureLocation(ExactPosition(4516), ExactPosition(5336), strand=1), type='mobile_element') >>> seq_record.seq Seq('GGATTGAATATAACCGACGTGACTGTTACATTTAGGTGGCTAAACCCGTCAAGC...GCC', IUPACAmbiguousDNA())  Input and output  Biopython can read and write to a number of common sequence formats, including FASTA, FASTQ, GenBank, Clustal, PHYLIP and NEXUS. When reading files, descriptive information in the file is used to populate the members of Biopython classes, such as \`SeqRecord\`. This allows records of one file format to be converted into others. Very large sequence files can exceed a computer's memory resources, so Biopython provides various options for accessing records in large files. They can be loaded entirely into memory in Python data structures, such as lists or dictionaries, providing fast access at the cost of memory usage. Alternatively, the files can be read from disk as needed, with slower performance but lower memory requirements. >>> # This script loads a file containing multiple sequences and saves each one in a different format. >>> from Bio import SeqIO >>> genomes = SeqIO.parse('salmonella.gb', 'genbank') >>> for genome in genomes: ... SeqIO.write(genome, genome.id + '.fasta', 'fasta')  Accessing online databases  Through the Bio.Entrez module, users of Biopython can download biological data from NCBI databases. Each of the functions provided by the Entrez search engine is available through functions in this module, including searching for and downloading records. >>> # This script downloads genomes from the NCBI Nucleotide database and saves them in a FASTA file. >>> from Bio import Entrez >>> from Bio import SeqIO >>> output_file = open('all_records.fasta', \\"w\\") >>> Entrez.email = 'my_email@example.com' >>> records_to_download = ['FO834906.1', 'FO203501.1'] >>> for record_id in records_to_download: ... handle = Entrez.efetch(db='nucleotide', id=record_id, rettype='gb') ... seqRecord = SeqIO.read(handle, format='gb') ... handle.close() ... output_file.write(seqRecord.format('fasta'))  Phylogeny  Figure 1: A rooted phylogenetic tree created by Bio.Phylo showing the relationship between different organisms' Apaf-1 homologs Figure 2: The same tree as above, drawn unrooted using Graphviz via Bio.Phylo The Bio.Phylo module provides tools for working with and visualising phylogenetic trees. A variety of file formats are supported for reading and writing, including Newick, NEXUS and phyloXML. Common tree manipulations and traversals are supported via the \`Tree\` and \`Clade\` objects. Examples include converting and collating tree files, extracting subsets from a tree, changing a tree's root, and analysing branch features such as length or score. Rooted trees can be drawn in ASCII or using matplotlib (see Figure 1), and the Graphviz library can be used to create unrooted layouts (see Figure 2).  Genome diagrams  Figure 3: A diagram of the genes on the pKPS77 plasmid, visualised using the GenomeDiagram module in Biopython The GenomeDiagram module provides methods of visualising sequences within Biopython. Sequences can be drawn in a linear or circular form (see Figure 3), and many output formats are supported, including PDF and PNG. Diagrams are created by making tracks and then adding sequence features to those tracks. By looping over a sequence's features and using their attributes to decide if and how they are added to the diagram's tracks, one can exercise much control over the appearance of the final diagram. Cross- links can be drawn between different tracks, allowing one to compare multiple sequences in a single diagram.  Macromolecular structure  The Bio.PDB module can load molecular structures from PDB and mmCIF files, and was added to Biopython in 2003. The \`Structure\` object is central to this module, and it organises macromolecular structure in a hierarchical fashion: \`Structure\` objects contain \`Model\` objects which contain \`Chain\` objects which contain \`Residue\` objects which contain \`Atom\` objects. Disordered residues and atoms get their own classes, \`DisorderedResidue\` and \`DisorderedAtom\`, that describe their uncertain positions. Using Bio.PDB, one can navigate through individual components of a macromolecular structure file, such as examining each atom in a protein. Common analyses can be carried out, such as measuring distances or angles, comparing residues and calculating residue depth.  Population genetics  The Bio.PopGen module adds support to Biopython for Genepop, a software package for statistical analysis of population genetics. This allows for analyses of Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg equilibrium, linkage disequilibrium and other features of a population's allele frequencies. This module can also carry out population genetic simulations using coalescent theory with the fastsimcoal2 program.  Wrappers for command line tools  Many of Biopython's modules contain command line wrappers for commonly used tools, allowing these tools to be used from within Biopython. These wrappers include BLAST, Clustal, PhyML, EMBOSS and SAMtools. Users can subclass a generic wrapper class to add support for any other command line tool.

It is the opposite of terrestrial motion sickness since it occurs when the environment and the person appear visually to be in motion relative to one another even though there is no corresponding sensation of bodily movement originating from the vestibular system.  Cause and remedy  When the vestibular system and the visual system report incongruous states of motion, the result is often nausea and other symptoms of disorientation known as motion sickness. According to contemporary sensory conflict theory, such conditions happen when the vestibular system and the visual system do not present a synchronized and unified representation of one's body and surroundings. This theory is also known as neural mismatch, implying a mismatch occurring between ongoing sensory experience and long-term memory rather than between components of the vestibular and visual systems, emphasizing \\"the limbic system in integration of sensory information and long- term memory, in the expression of the symptoms of motion sickness, and the impact of anti-motion-sickness drugs and stress hormones on limbic system function. The limbic system may be the neural mismatch center of the brain.\\" At present a \\"fully adequate theory of motion sickness is not presently available\\" but at present the sensory conflict theory, referring to \\"a discontinuity between either visual, proprioceptive, and somatosensory input, or semicircular canal and otolith input\\", may be the best available. Space adaptation syndrome or space sickness is a kind of motion sickness that can occur when one's surroundings visually appear to be in motion, but without a corresponding sense of bodily motion. This incongruous condition can occur during space travel when changes in g-forces compromise one's spatial orientation. According to Science Daily, \\"Gravity plays a major role in our spatial orientation. Changes in gravitational forces, such as the transition to weightlessness during a space voyage, influence our spatial orientation and require adaptation by many of the physiological processes in which our balance system plays a part. As long as this adaptation is incomplete, this can be coupled to nausea, visual illusions, and disorientation.\\" Sleep deprivation can also increase susceptibility to space sickness, making symptoms worse and longer-lasting. According to the sensory conflict hypothesis, space sickness is the opposite of the kinds of motion-related disorientation that occur in the presence of gravity, known as terrestrial motion sickness, such as becoming carsick, seasick, or airsick. In such cases, and in contrast to space sickness, one's surroundings seem visually immobile (such as inside a car or airplane or a cabin below decks) while one's body feels itself to be in motion. Contemporary motion sickness medications can counter all kinds of motion disorientation including space sickness by temporarily suppressing the vestibular system, but are rarely used for space travel because it is considered better to allow space travelers to adapt naturally over the first one to seven days rather than to suffer the drowsiness and other side effects of medication taken over a longer period. However, transdermal dimenhydrinate anti-nausea patches are typically used whenever space suits are worn because vomiting into a space suit could be fatal by obscuring vision or blocking airflow. Space suits are generally worn during launch and landing by NASA crew members and always for extra-vehicular activities (EVAs). EVAs are consequently not usually scheduled for the first days of a mission to allow the crew to adapt, and transdermal dimenhydrinate patches are typically used as an additional backup measure. Just as space sickness has the opposite cause compared to terrestrial motion sickness, the two conditions have opposite non- medicinal remedies. The idea of sensory conflict implies that the most direct remedy for motion sickness in general is to resolve the conflict by re- synchronizing what one sees and what one feels. For most (but not all) kinds of terrestrial motion sickness, that can be achieved by viewing one's surroundings from a window or (in the case of seasickness) going up on deck to observe the seas. For space sickness, relief is available via the opposite move of restricting one's vision to a small area such as a book or a small screen, disregarding the overall surroundings until the adaptation process is complete, or simply to close one's eyes until the nauseated feeling is reduced in intensity during the adjustment period. Some research indicates that blindness itself does not provide relief; \\"Motion sickness can occur during exposure to physical motion, visual motion, and virtual motion, and only those without a functioning vestibular system are fully immune. As with sea sickness and car sickness, space motion sickness symptoms can vary from mild nausea and disorientation to vomiting and intense discomfort; headaches and nausea are often reported in varying degrees. The most extreme reaction yet recorded was that felt by Senator Jake Garn in 1985 on space shuttle flight STS-51-D. NASA later jokingly began using the informal \\"Garn scale\\" to measure reactions to space sickness. In most cases, symptoms last from 2‚Äì4 days. When asked about the origins of \\"Garn\\", Robert E. Stevenson said: Garn's purpose on the mission was in part to subject him to experiments on space motion sickness. Predicting whether someone will experience space sickness is not possible. Someone who suffers from car sickness may not suffer from space sickness, and vice versa. In excellent physical condition, Garn did not become sick on the vomit comet before STS-51-D. All three astronauts on Skylab 3 suffered from nausea, although the three on Skylab 2 had not; the illness affected their work during the first few days, worrying NASA doctors. Experienced aviators and space travelers can suffer from space sickness. Garn began piloting at the age of 16 and piloted a variety of military aircraft for 17,000 hours‚Äîmore than any NASA astronaut‚Äîbefore STS-51-D. Charles D. Walker became ill on the same flight despite having flown on the shuttle before. While the Skylab 3 crew quickly recovered‚Äîwhether by eating six smaller meals instead of three larger ones, or just by becoming used to space‚Äîone of the Skylab 4 crew became sick despite anti-nausea medication. Steven Smith estimated that on four shuttle flights he threw up 100 times. Space sickness that occurs during space flight can also continue for days after landing, until the vestibular system has again adapted to gravity.  Impacts to worker safety  Space motion sickness can lead to degraded astronaut performance. SMS threatens operational requirements, reduces situational awareness, and threatens the safety of those exposed to micro-g environments. Lost muscle mass leads to difficulty with movement, especially when astronauts return to earth. This can pose a safety issue if the need for emergency egress were to arise. Loss of muscle power makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for astronauts to climb through emergency egress hatches or create unconventional exit spaces in the case of a crash upon landing. Additionally, bone resorption and inadequate hydration in space can lead to the formation of kidney stones, and subsequent sudden incapacitation due to pain. If this were to occur during critical phases of flight, a capsule crash leading to worker injury and/or death could result. Short-term and long-term health effects have been seen in the cardiovascular system from exposure to the micro-g environment that would limit those exposed after they return to Earth or a regular gravity environment. Steps need to be taken to ensure proper precautions are taken into consideration when dealing a micro-g environment for worker safety. Orthostatic intolerance can lead to temporary loss of consciousness due to the lack of pressure and stroke volume. This loss of consciousness inhibits and endangers those affected and can lead to deadly consequences.  History  In August 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Gherman Titov became the first human to experience space sickness on Vostok II; he was the first person to vomit in space. Apart from that record, space motion sickness was effectively unknown during the earliest spaceflights (Mercury, Gemini series) probably because these missions were undertaken in spacecraft providing very cramped conditions and permitting very little room for head movements; space sickness seems to be aggravated by being able to freely move around, especially in regard to head movement, and so is more common in larger spacecraft.

Balmain is located west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Inner West Council. It sits on a small peninsula that juts out of Sydney Harbour, directly opposite Milsons Point. It is located on the Balmain peninsula surrounded by Port Jackson, adjacent to the suburbs of Rozelle to the south-west, Birchgrove to the north-west, and Balmain East to the east. Iron Cove sits on the western side of the peninsula, with White Bay on the south-east side and Mort Bay on the north-east side. Traditionally blue collar, Balmain was where the industrial roots of the trade unionist movement began. It has become established in Australian working-class culture and history, due to being the place where the Australian Labor Party formed in 1891 and its social history and status is of high cultural significance to both Sydney and New South Wales. Today, the ALP contends with the Australian Greens for political prominence in Balmain, and Jamie Parker of the Greens holds the State seat of Balmain. History Darling Street around 1888 Prior to European settlement, the area was inhabited by indigenous Aboriginal Australian, Gadigal and Wangal people. Stories from early settlers in the area tell of how the local indigenous people used to hunt kangaroo by driving them through the bushy peninsula, down the hill to Peacock Point at the east end, where they were killed. The area now known as Balmain was part of a grant to colonial surgeon Dr William Balmain (1762‚Äì1803) made in 1800 by Governor John Hunter. A year later, Balmain transferred his entire holding to settle a debt to John Borthwick Gilchrist before returning to Scotland. The legality of the land transfer from Balmain to Gilchrist for only 5 shillings was challenged by Balmain's descendants and further development of the area was blocked. The area subsequently became known as Gilchrist's place, though court documents refer to the area as the Balmain Estate. During the many years of legal challenges, the land was leased for farming and cattle purposes. In 1814 the adjacent homestead of Birchgrove was sold to Roland Warpole Loane, a merchant and settler descended from a family of English landlords. One hundred acres on the adjoining Balmain estate were leased to Loane.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, , p.14 Lever Brothers Factory 1939 In 1833, Gilchrist transferred power of attorney to Frederick Parbury. When Loane's lease finally expired in 1836 and the land retrieved from his possession, Parbury commissioned surveyor John Armstrong to sub-divide the land into six parcels. Three parcels were sold to Thomas Hyndes in 1837. The area was rapidly sub-divided and developed during the 1840s and by 1861 had been divided into the well populated eastern suburb of Balmain and the sparsely populated western area, extending to the gates of Callan Park, known as Balmain West. Early City Subdivision Balmain, Darling St, Elliott St, Terry St, Claremont St Industry The peninsula changed rapidly during the 1800s and became one of the premier industrial centres of Sydney. Industries clustered around Mort Bay included shipbuilding, a metal foundry, engineering, boilermaking and the Mort's Dock and Engineering Company works which opened in 1855‚Äîin 1958 Mort's Dock closed and is the site of Mort Bay Park. Increasing industrialisation at Balmain created a demand for cheap housing. This was satisfied by the dock owners selling small blocks of land to entrepreneurs who then built tiny cottages and rented them to the workers. The Balmain Reservoir was built in 1915. electric tram at Balmain East ferry wharf in 1951 Lever Brothers Factory, owned by the British parent company, opened in 1895. Colliery A coal mine was opened in 1897 beside what is now Birchgrove Public School by an English company. The winding engine was said to be the largest in the southern hemisphere. However, with the endless labour disputes.Cessnock Eagle & South Maitland Recorder Friday 17 Nov 1933, p.1. Sydney Collieries Limited took over ownership. A further new shaft was sunk in 1904. From the bottom of the shafts a decline led down to a seam of coal situated under the harbour between Ballast Point and Goat Island.Lawrence, J; Warne, C; A Pictorial History of Balmain to Glebe, Kingsclear Books, 1995, . Because of the availability of the coal, Balmain Power Station was erected in stages from 1909. However, there were major industrial disputes in the 1920s and calls were made by some shareholders in 1928 to close the mine.Newcastle Sun Monday 18 June 1928, p.6. The following year the colliery still employed 299 miners.Newcastle Morning Herald Sat 30 Nov 1929, p.29. By 1930 the colliery owners had given up and it had been taken over by the Balmain Coal Contracting Company, established by the Miner's FederationEvening News, Sydney, Friday 4 April 1930, p.7. to keep the pit operational, to no avail as disputes continued. On 13 Oct 1930 the Miners' Lodge declared the mine \\"blacked\\" as well as the manager, whose dismissal they demanded.Barrier Miner, broken Hill, Tuesday 14 Oct 1930, p.1. The colliery closed in 1931. In 1933 it was proposed to extract natural gas for commercial use from the now disused mine. In 1936 calls were made for the Sydney City Council to take over the mine to no avail.The Sun, Sydney, 22 April 1936, p.6. Railway The opening of the railway in the 1920s further established Balmain and it gained a reputation as a rough working-class area of Sydney. A large influx of immigrants boosted Balmain's population in the 1950s. Gentrification Gentrification of Balmain began in the 1960s as industry waned. Balmain's desirability to the middle class was due in part to its waterfront location and proximity to Sydney's CBD. The Balmain Association was formed in 1965. Increasing property values and waterfront development continued to push the suburb's remaining industry out. In 1996, the Lever Brothers site became a series of apartment complexes with a handful of original buildings preserved. The power station was demolished in 1998 to make way for apartments. However, many aspects of Balmain's industrial past have been retained as heritage.  Heritage listings  View over Sydney from Balmain Balmain has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 1 Blake Street: Ewenton * Booth Street: Balmain Hospital Main Building * Glassop Street: Dawn Fraser Swimming Pool * 12b Grafton Street: Hampton Villa * 37 Nicholson Street: Waterview Wharf Workshops * Thames, Mort, College, McKell, Cameron, Yeend Streets: Mort's Dock * 2 Wells Street: Louisaville Demographics According to the 2016 census of population, there were 10,453 residents in Balmain. 61.9% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 9.1%, New Zealand 3.3%, Ireland 1.5% and United States of America 1.5%. 79.6% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Italian at 1.3%. The most common responses for religion in Balmain (State Suburbs) were No Religion 41.2%, Catholic 22.3%, Not stated 12.5%, Anglican 11.4% and Presbyterian and Reformed 2.1%. Commercial area alfresco cafes and dining establishments, giving a prominent dining culture to the area Balmain Working Men's Institute View of the Sydney Harbour Bridge from East Balmain, Barangaroo Reserve is in the foreground Darling Street, Balmain's main thoroughfare, features boutique shops, quality restaurants and cafes alongside old drinking establishments. Landmarks on this street include the Post Office and Court House, alongside Balmain Town Hall, the historic Westpac Bank, Balmain Fire Station and Balmain Working Men's Institute. Other commercial developments are scattered throughout the suburb. The headquarters of the NSW Water Police moved to Cameron Cove in Balmain in late 2007. Transport Balmain Shipyard Balmain has several ferry wharves including Thames Street Balmain serviced by the Cockatoo Island ferry services, Elliot Street, Balmain West and Darling Street, Balmain East serviced by the Cross Harbour ferry services . Services run to Circular Quay. Transdev Sydney Ferries' maintenance and repair base is at Balmain Shipyard. Balmain's road network feeds into three main roads‚ÄîDarling Street, Beattie Street and Montague/Mullen Street. These streets have limited speeds, typically 40 km/h and are all single carriageway with parallel parking. Due to the geography of the peninsula, all of these roads feed into Victoria Road and the Western Distributor. Trams once ran all the way down Darling Street to the Wharf at Balmain East. Due to the very steep incline at the bottom of the street, the trams used a complex 'dummy' counterweight system constructed under the road surface. The trams were pushed up the steep hill by the dummy, and rode the dummy on the way down to safely descend the hill. Transit Systems bus services that service Balmain are: 441 ‚Äì Birchgrove to Art Gallery of New South Wales via Rozelle and QVB, 442 ‚Äì Balmain to the Queen Victoria Building via Rozelle, 445 ‚Äì Balmain to Campsie, 433 ‚Äì Balmain to Martin Place. Culture Drinking establishments Balmain is home to many historic hotels, including the Cat and Fiddle Hotel, Cricketer's Arms Hotel, Dick's Hotel, Dry Dock Hotel, Exchange Hotel, Forth & Clyde Hotel, Kent Hotel, Unity Hall Hotel, London Hotel, Mort Bay Hotel, Norfolk Pines Hotel, Pacific Hotel, Royal Oak Hotel, Shipwright's Arms Hotel, Star Hotel, Town Hall Hotel, Volunteer Hotel and the West End Hotel. The Riverview Hotel is a heritage-listed corner building built in 1880 in the Arts and Crafts style.NSW Heritage Office; Riverview Hotel, Inventory Item. Retrieved October 2006. Between 1888 and 1913 the pub was named Bergin's Hotel after the publican Joseph Bergin. Australian swimming champion Dawn Fraser was publican of the Riverview from 1978 to 1983.Davidson, B; Hamey, K; Nicholls, D; Called to the Bar ‚Äì 150 Years of pubs in Balmain & Rozelle, The Balmain Association, 1991, . Pop culture Exchange Hotel, Beattie Streetthumb Numerous phrases have been used to describe the suburb and its inhabitants, including \\"Balmain boys don't cry\\" (former NSW Premier Neville Wran at the Street Royal Commission); \\"You can take the boy out of Balmain, but you can't take Balmain out of the boy\\" (Unknown); \\"There are only two types of men in this world: those who were born in Balmain and those who wish they were\\" (a Police Commissioner of New South Wales). Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating commented on the suburb's gentrification by using the term \\"Basket weavers of Balmain\\". Until the 1970s, older Balmain people would refer to \\"going to Sydney\\". The Post Office/ Court/ Police building and vicinity was generally referred to as the \\"Town Hall\\", with the Post Office clock often called the Town Hall clock. This was probably due to the Post Office & Court Building being built in between the earlier Town Hall & Town Hall Hotel. In the mid-1960s Balmain was the setting for the popular Seven Network situation comedy series My Name's McGooley, What's Yours?, starring Gordon Chater, John Meillon and Judi Farr. Balmain was the setting for the 1994 Australian film The Sum of Us, which starred Jack Thompson, John Polson and Russell Crowe. The former Pacific Hotel (from 2019, now converted into a residential property) - as well as several other locations in Balmain - were used extensively as the set of the Australian television soap opera, E Street. Parks and reserves Public open space on the shores of Mort Bay on the Balmain, Balmain East border Balmain has a number of parks including Gladstone Park, Birrung Park and White Bay Park. The wider peninsula has many more parks in close proximity, particularly along the foreshores. In earlier times Punch Park was the goto place for park footy (rugby league), though it was always referred to by the boys then as Punch's Park Sport and recreation Balmain is home to the Balmain Tigers district rugby league football club that is now represented in the NRL by Wests Tigers rugby league club. The club was formed in mid-1999 by a joint venture between the Balmain Tigers and the Western Suburbs Magpies in preparation for the 2000 season. In 2005 the Tigers defeated the North Queensland Cowboys in the Grand Final to win the premiership. The Balmain Rugby Football Club, founded in 1873, took part in the very first competition structure and in fact winning their first premiership in 1875. Players lost fighting in World War I forced the club to merge with the Glebe \\"Dirty Reds\\" RUFC in 1919, to form the Glebe-Balmain RFC. As a merged club they had enormous success during the Twenties, winning four premierships. In 1931, as a depression project, Drummoyne Oval, as it is now known, was constructed on the site of a small oval which Glebe and Balmain had used for junior matches since 1892. To ensure longevity of tenure, and because there were just not enough sporting grounds in Sydney‚Äîwith some reluctance‚Äîthe Glebe-Balmain Club decided to change its name to the Drummoyne District Rugby Football Club. It did so without giving up its long-held traditions, the scarlet jumpers of Glebe and its world-famous tag, \\"The Dirty Reds\\" and the black and gold of Balmain, colours still worn proudly by today's players in their socks. Drummoyne Rugby Club is still in existence and still upholds it proud history and traditions. The suburb is also home to the Balmain Australian Football Club, a founding member in 1903 of the Sydney Football League. Balmain is also home to Balmain FC, who are a semi-professional football club, playing in the National Premier Leagues NSW 3. In 2015 they qualified for the Australia-wide FFA Cup Round of 32 and were drawn against A-League club Melbourne Victory FC in which they were defeated 6‚Äì0 in front of 5,000 fans at Leichhardt Oval. Balmain Sailing Club is located in nearby Birchgrove and is home to the annual Balmain Regatta. Balmain Rowing Club was formed in July 1882, and still occupies its original White Street location. The club adopted black and yellow colours from its formation, which soon became the district colours. The great Illawarra sculling champion Bill Beach had a close association with the club and wore their black and gold colours in competition. Housing The post-industrial gentrification of Balmain has resulted in a suburb of considerable charm and interest where the modest, pretty houses command high prices. However, Balmain still retains a diverse mix of residents due to the Housing Commission unit blocks in the suburb.Solling, M; Reynolds, P; Leichhardt: On the margins of the city, Allen & Unwin, 1997, . Much of the suburb is a heritage conservation area and creative design is required to modernise the Victorian and Edwardian housing stock.

It is a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found. It is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome. CML is largely treated with targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since 2001. These drugs have revolutionized treatment of this disease and allow most patients to have a good quality of life when compared to the former chemotherapy drugs. In Western countries, CML accounts for 15‚Äì25% of all adult leukemias and 14% of leukemias overall (including the pediatric population, where CML is less common). Signs and symptoms The way CML presents depends on the stage of the disease at diagnosis as it has been known to skip stages in some cases. Most patients (~90%) are diagnosed during the chronic stage which is most often asymptomatic. In these cases it may be diagnosed incidentally with an elevated white blood cell count on a routine laboratory test. It can also present with symptoms indicative of hepatosplenomegaly and the resulting upper quadrant pain this causes. The enlarged spleen may put pressure on the stomach causing a loss of appetite and resulting weight loss. It may also present with mild fever and night sweats due to an elevated basal level of metabolism. Some (<10%) are diagnosed during the accelerated stage which most often presents bleeding, petechiae and ecchymosis. In these patients fevers are most commonly the result of opportunistic infections. Some patients are initially diagnosed in the blast phase in which the symptoms are most likely fever, bone pain and an increase in bone marrow fibrosis. Cause In most cases no obvious cause for CML can be isolated. Risk factors CML is more common in males than in females (male to female ratio of 1.4:1) and appears more commonly in the elderly with a median age at diagnosis of 65 years. Exposure to ionising radiation appears to be a risk factor, based on a 50 fold higher incidence of CML in Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombing survivors. The rate of CML in these individuals seems to peak about 10 years after the exposure. Pathophysiology Diagram showing the translocation found in the Philadelphia chromosome CML was the first cancer to be linked to a clear genetic abnormality, the chromosomal translocation known as the Philadelphia chromosome. This chromosomal abnormality is so named because it was first discovered and described in 1960 by two scientists from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA: Peter Nowell of the University of Pennsylvania and David Hungerford of Fox Chase Cancer Center. In this translocation, parts of two chromosomes (the 9th and 22nd) switch places. As a result, part of the BCR (\\"breakpoint cluster region\\") gene from chromosome 22 is fused with the ABL gene on chromosome 9. This abnormal \\"fusion\\" gene generates a protein of p210 or sometimes p185 weight (p210 is short for 210 kDa protein, a shorthand used for characterizing proteins based solely on size). Because abl carries a domain that can add phosphate groups to tyrosine residues (a tyrosine kinase), the bcr-abl fusion gene product is also a tyrosine kinase. Diagram showing the cells CML can develop from The fused BCR-ABL protein interacts with the interleukin 3beta(c) receptor subunit. The BCR-ABL transcript is continuously active and does not require activation by other cellular messaging proteins. In turn, BCR-ABL activates a cascade of proteins that control the cell cycle, speeding up cell division. Moreover, the BCR-ABL protein inhibits DNA repair, causing genomic instability and making the cell more susceptible to developing further genetic abnormalities. The action of the BCR-ABL protein is the pathophysiologic cause of chronic myelogenous leukemia. With improved understanding of the nature of the BCR-ABL protein and its action as a tyrosine kinase, targeted therapies (the first of which was imatinib) that specifically inhibit the activity of the BCR-ABL protein have been developed. These tyrosine kinase inhibitors can induce complete remissions in CML, confirming the central importance of bcr-abl as the cause of CML. Diagnosis Chronic myeloid leukemia in a 4 years old female. Peripheral blood (MGG stain) Peripheral blood (MGG stain): marked leukocytosis with granulocyte left shift A small, hypolobated megakaryocyte (center of field) in a bone marrow aspirate, characteristic of chronic myeloid leukemia. CML is often suspected on the basis of a complete blood count, which shows increased granulocytes of all types, typically including mature myeloid cells. Basophils and eosinophils are almost universally increased; this feature may help differentiate CML from a leukemoid reaction. A bone marrow biopsy is often performed as part of the evaluation for CML, and CML is diagnosed by cytogenetics that detects the translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) which involves the ABL1 gene in chromosome 9 and the BCR gene in chromosome 22. As a result of this translocation, the chromosome looks smaller than its homologue chromosome, and this appearance is known as the Philadelphia chromosome chromosomal abnormality. Thus, this abnormality can be detected by routine cytogenetics, and the involved genes BCR-ABL1 can be detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization, as well as by PCR. Controversy exists over so-called Ph-negative CML, or cases of suspected CML in which the Philadelphia chromosome cannot be detected. Many such patients in fact have complex chromosomal abnormalities that mask the (9;22) translocation, or have evidence of the translocation by FISH or RT-PCR in spite of normal routine karyotyping. The small subset of patients without detectable molecular evidence of BCR-ABL1 fusion may be better classified as having an undifferentiated myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorder, as their clinical course tends to be different from patients with CML. CML must be distinguished from a leukemoid reaction, which can have a similar appearance on a blood smear. Classification CML is often divided into three phases based on clinical characteristics and laboratory findings. In the absence of intervention, CML typically begins in the chronic phase, and over the course of several years progresses to an accelerated phase and ultimately to a blast crisis. Blast crisis is the terminal phase of CML and clinically behaves like an acute leukemia. Drug treatment will usually stop this progression if started early. One of the drivers of the progression from chronic phase through acceleration and blast crisis is the acquisition of new chromosomal abnormalities (in addition to the Philadelphia chromosome). Some patients may already be in the accelerated phase or blast crisis by the time they are diagnosed. Chronic phase Approximately 85% of patients with CML are in the chronic phase at the time of diagnosis. During this phase, patients are usually asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms of fatigue, left side pain, joint and/or hip pain, or abdominal fullness. The duration of chronic phase is variable and depends on how early the disease was diagnosed as well as the therapies used. In the absence of treatment, the disease progresses to an accelerated phase. Precise patient staging based on clinical markers and personal genomic profile will likely prove beneficial in the assessment of disease history with respect to progression risk. Accelerated phase Criteria for diagnosing transition into the accelerated phase are somewhat variable; the most widely used criteria are those put forward by investigators at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, by Sokal et al., and the World Health Organization. The WHO criteria are perhaps most widely used, and define the accelerated phase by the presence of ‚â•1 of the following haematological/cytogenetic criteria or provisional criteria concerning response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy *Haematological/cytogenetic criteria Persistent or increasing high white blood cell count (> 10 √ó 109/L), unresponsive to therapy Persistent or increasing splenomegaly, unresponsive to therapy Persistent thrombocytosis (> 1000 √ó 109/L), unresponsive to therapy Persistent thrombocytopenia (< 100 √ó 109/L), unrelated to therapy ‚â• 20% basophils in the peripheral blood 10‚Äï19% blasts in the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow Additional clonal chromosomal abnormalities in Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive (Ph+) cells at diagnosis, including so-called major route abnormalities (a second Ph chromosome, trisomy 8, isochromosome 17q, trisomy 19), complex karyotype, and abnormalities of 3q26.2 Any new clonal chromosomal abnormality in Ph+ cells that occurs during therapy *Provisional response-to-TKI criteria Haematological resistance (or failure to achieve a complete haematological response d) to the first TKI Any haematological, cytogenetic, or molecular indications of resistance to two sequential TKIs Occurrence of two or more mutations in the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene during TKI therapy The patient is considered to be in the accelerated phase if any of the above are present. The accelerated phase is significant because it signals that the disease is progressing and transformation to blast crisis is imminent. Drug treatment often becomes less effective in the advanced stages. Blast crisis Blast crisis is the final phase in the evolution of CML, and behaves like an acute leukemia, with rapid progression and short survival. Blast crisis is diagnosed if any of the following are present in a patient with CML: *>20% blasts in the blood or bone marrow *The presence of an extramedullary proliferation of blasts Treatment The only curative treatment for CML is a bone marrow transplant or an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Other than this there are four major mainstays of treatment in CML: treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, myelosuppressive or leukopheresis therapy (to counteract the leukocytosis during early treatment), splenectomy and interferon alfa-2b treatment. Due to the high median age of patients with CML it is relatively rare for CML to be seen in pregnant women, despite this, however, chronic myelogenous leukemia can be treated with relative safety at any time during pregnancy with Interferon-alpha hormones. Chronic phase In the past, antimetabolites (e.g., cytarabine, hydroxyurea), alkylating agents, interferon alfa 2b, and steroids were used as treatments of CML in the chronic phase, but since the 2000s have been replaced by Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitors drugs that specifically target BCR-ABL, the constitutively activated tyrosine kinase fusion protein caused by the Philadelphia chromosome translocation. Despite the move to replacing cytotoxic antineoplastics (standard anticancer drugs) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors sometimes hydroxyurea is still used to counteract the high leukocyte counts encountered during treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib; in these situations it may be the preferred myelosuppressive agent due to its relative lack of leukemogenic effects and hence the relative lack of potential for secondary hematologic malignancies to result from treatment. IRIS, an international study that compared interferon/cytarabine combination and the first of these new drugs imatinib, with long-term follow up, demonstrated the clear superiority of tyrosine-kinase-targeted inhibition over existing treatments. Imatinib The first of this new class of drugs was imatinib mesylate (marketed as Gleevec or Glivec), approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001. Imatinib was found to inhibit the progression of CML in the majority of patients (65‚Äì75%) sufficiently to achieve regrowth of their normal bone marrow stem cell population (a cytogenetic response) with stable proportions of maturing white blood cells. Because some leukemic cells (as evaluated by RT- PCR) persist in nearly all patients, the treatment has to be continued indefinitely. Since the advent of imatinib, CML has become the first cancer in which a standard medical treatment may give to the patient a normal life expectancy. Dasatinib, nilotinib, radotinib and bosutinib To overcome imatinib resistance and to increase responsiveness to TK inhibitors, four novel agents were later developed. The first, dasatinib, blocks several further oncogenic proteins, in addition to more potent inhibition of the BCR- ABL protein, and was initially approved in 2007 by the US FDA to treat CML in patients who were either resistant to or intolerant of imatinib. A second new TK inhibitor, nilotinib, was also approved by the FDA for the same indication. In 2010, nilotinib and dasatinib were also approved for first-line therapy, making three drugs in this class available for treatment of newly diagnosed CML. In 2012, Radotinib joined the class of novel agents in the inhibition of the BCR-ABL protein and was approved in South Korea for patients resistant to or intolerant of imatinib. Bosutinib received US FDA and EU European Medicines Agency approval on 4 September 2012 and 27 March 2013 respectively for the treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with resistance, or intolerance to prior therapy. Treatment-resistant CML While capable of producing significantly improved responses compared with the action of imatinib, neither dasatinib nor nilotinib could overcome drug resistance caused by one particular mutation found to occur in the structure of BCR-ABL1 known as the T315I mutation (in other words, where the 315th amino acid is mutated from a threonine residue to an isoleucine residue). Two approaches were developed to the treatment of CML as a result: In 2007, Chemgenex released results of an open-label Phase 2/3 study (CGX-635-CML-202) that investigated the use of a non BCR-ABL targeted agent omacetaxine, administered subcutaneously (under the skin) in patients who had failed with imatinib and exhibited T315I kinase domain mutation. This is a study which is ongoing through 2014. In September 2012, the FDA approved omacetaxine for the treatment of CML in the case of resistance to other chemotherapeutic agents. Independently, ARIAD pharmaceuticals, adapting the chemical structures from first and second- generation TK inhibitors, arrived at a new pan-BCR-ABL1 inhibitor which showed (for the first time) efficacy against T315I, as well as all other known mutations of the oncoprotein. The drug, ponatinib, gained FDA approval in December 2012 for treatment of patients with resistant or intolerant CML. Just as with second generation TK inhibitors, early approval is being sought to extend the use of ponatinib to newly diagnosed CML also.  Vaccination  In 2005, encouraging but mixed results of vaccination were reported with the BCR/ABL1 p210 fusion protein in patients with stable disease, with GM-CSF as an adjuvant. Prognosis Before the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the median survival time for CML patients had been about 3‚Äì5 years from time of diagnosis. With the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, survival rates have improved dramatically. A 2006 followup of 553 patients using imatinib (Gleevec) found an overall survival rate of 89% after five years. A 2011 followup of 832 patients using imatinib who achieved a stable cytogenetic response found an overall survival rate of 95.2% after 8 years, which is similar to the rate in the general population. Fewer than 1% of patients died because of leukemia progression. Epidemiology United Kingdom CML accounts for 8% of all leukaemias in the UK, and around 680 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2011. United States The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2014, about 5,980 new cases of chronic myeloid leukemia were diagnosed, and about 810 people died of the disease. This means that a little over 10% of all newly diagnosed leukemia cases will be chronic myeloid leukemia. The average risk of a person getting this disease is 1 in 588. The disease is more common in men than women, and more common in whites than African-Americans. The average age at diagnosis is 64 years, and this disease is rarely seen in children.

He was the first person to represent the Australian Capital Territory in both houses of federal parliament Early life McMullan was born in Perth, Western Australia, and educated at Governor Stirling Senior High School and the University of Western Australia where he studied economics and arts. Active in the movement against the Vietnam War, he was conscripted for military service in 1968 but successfully argued in court that he was a conscientious objector.Grattan, Michelle: Labor man for everyman, The Age, 25 March 1981. He became an industrial advocate for the trade unions, joining the Labor Party in 1973.Bob McMullan Labor Party involvement In 1975, McMullan became the Labor Party's Western Australian State Secretary. In 1981, he was elected National Secretary of the Labor Party and he directed the ALP's three successful election campaigns in 1983, 1984 and 1987. He remains the most successful National Secretary of the Labor Party ever. Parliamentary career On 16 February 1988,Parliamentary Handbook: Historical Information on the Australian Parliament McMullan was chosen by a joint sitting of the House of Representatives and the Senate to fill a casual vacancy in the representation of the Australian Capital Territory in the Senate, caused by the resignation of Susan Ryan. This was the second (and last) time that a territory senate vacancy was filled in this way.Footnote, p.3 McMullan was Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer 1990‚Äì93, Minister for the Arts and Minister for Administrative Services 1993‚Äì94, Minister for Administrative Services 1994 and Minister for Trade 1994‚Äì96 in the government of Paul Keating. On 6 February 1996 he resigned his Senate seat in order to contest the Division of Canberra in the House of Representatives at the March election; he was successful. The Keating government having been defeated by John Howard, Labor went into opposition and McMullan was elected as a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry. In 1998, following a redistribution, McMullan moved to the neighbouring seat of Fraser. McMullan became Manager of Opposition Business (opposite number to the Leader of the House) in 1998, and following Labor's 2001 electoral defeat he was made Shadow Treasurer. In July 2003 McMullan was replaced as Shadow Treasurer by Mark Latham and relegated to the post of Shadow Minister for Finance, taking on additional responsibility for Reconciliation and Indigenous Affairs. When Latham became Leader he gave the job of Shadow Treasurer to his predecessor Simon Crean, despite having promised the job to McMullan. McMullan then became Shadow Minister for Finance and Shadow Minister for Small Business. In Question Time in Parliament, McMullan gained a reputation for repeatedly asking the same question in different words if he did not get a direct answer. After the 2004 election, McMullan did not stand for election to the Shadow Cabinet, in what was widely seen as an expression of lack of confidence in the leadership of Mark Latham. Following the election of Kevin Rudd on 4 December 2006 as Opposition Leader in place of Kim Beazley, McMullan returned to the front bench in the junior role of Labor spokesperson on Federal-State Relations,See Federalism in Australia and Federation of Australia the reform of which was one of Rudd's declared priorities.

Arriving as a one year old stray, he served under the premierships of Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair, retiring six months after the Blairs moved into Downing Street. He was the successor to Wilberforce. He was frequently referred to in jest by the press as an actual employee at Number 10. Start of employment Humphrey was found as a stray by a Cabinet Office civil servant and named in honour of Sir Humphrey Appleby, the archetypal civil servant of Yes Minister and Yes, Prime Minister. After the death of the previous mouser, Wilberforce, in 1988 the Cabinet Office and Number 10 were in need of a replacement and so Humphrey began his work. At a cost of about ¬£100 a year (paid for from the Cabinet Office's budget), most of which went towards food, Humphrey was said to be of considerably better value than the Cabinet's professional pest controller, who charged ¬£4,000 a year and is reported to have never caught a mouse. Frequently pictured posing by the famous Number 10 front door, Humphrey's primary duties involved catching mice and rats in the maze of Downing Street buildings. The poor quality of the buildings, some of which date from the 16th century, and the nearby St. James's Park ensure a continuous vermin problem. By the time of his retirement, Humphrey had risen to the position of Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office. Humphrey's problems In November 1993, an internal memo was circulated in the Cabinet Office informing staff that Humphrey was suffering from a minor kidney complaint and had been put on a special diet. A ban on feeding him treats was instituted. Humphrey was accused on 7 June 1994, of having killed four robin chicks, which were nesting in a window box outside the office of John Major, then Prime Minister. However, Major exonerated him the next day, declaring, \\"I am afraid Humphrey has been falsely accused.\\" It was not until March 2006 that he was finally cleared: journalist George Jones of The Daily Telegraph admitted that his piece in the paper's diary column had been no more than \\"journalistic licence\\" printed with no supporting evidence. In September 1994, Humphrey was found in St. James's Park and was blamed for having \\"savaged\\" a duck there, earlier in the year. Goes missing In June 1995, Humphrey went missing. Downing Street did not disclose the fact until it was mentioned to Sheila Gunn, a journalist on The Times, after Gunn told a member of staff that her own cat had died. Gunn's story was mentioned on the front page. The publicity led to his rediscovery in the nearby Royal Army Medical College, where he had been taken in as a presumed stray and renamed PC, short for \\"patrol cat\\". Upon his return, Humphrey issued a statement through the civil service stating, \\"I have had a wonderful holiday at the Royal Army Medical College, but it is nice to be back and I am looking forward to the new parliamentary session.\\" Humphrey and the Blairs Within a week of Tony Blair moving to 10 Downing Street after the May 1997 general election, press reports of a rift between Humphrey and Cherie Blair, the new Prime Minister's wife, emerged. Cherie Blair was reported to either be allergic to cats or to believe them to be unhygienic. Sheila Gunn, who had gone on to be John Major's press advisor, later admitted that she was the source of these reports which her obituary says were based \\"on a hunch for which she had no evidence\\". At the time, a spokesperson insisted that Humphrey would not be moving out, stating that Number 10 \\"is Humphrey's home and, as far as the Blairs are concerned, it will remain his home\\". A photo of Humphrey and Cherie Blair was released, though this did little to allay fears that he would be forced out. Allegations were later made that Humphrey was sedated by press secretary Alastair Campbell before undergoing the ordeal. The photo was used on the cover of Private Eye with Humphrey stating \\"I am going to hit the mouse running\\" a paraphrase of a New Labourism. In November 1997, Humphrey's primary carer, Jonathan Rees, who worked in the Prime Minister's Policy Unit, wrote a memo stating that the cat should retire to a \\"stable home environment where he can be looked after properly\\". While his continuing kidney problems were given as the reason for his retirement, many believed that Cherie Blair was behind the decision. Rumours of murder Humphrey moved to his new home with an elderly couple in suburban London on 13 November 1997, though his retirement was not announced until the next day to reduce the risk of kidnap attempts.. The Conservatives were quick to point out that Humphrey lived happily at Number 10 for almost eight years under a Conservative government but moved out within six months of Labour taking power.Nigel Evans, quoted in Conservative MP and animal lover Alan Clark was suspicious about the way Humphrey's retirement was announced and demanded proof that the cat was still alive: \\"Humphrey is now a missing person. Unless I hear from him or he makes a public appearance, I suspect he has been shot.\\" This led to rumours that Humphrey had been put down on the orders of Cherie Blair. The Prime Minister's office insisted that veterinary advice was behind the decision to remove Humphrey from Downing Street, and on 24 November 1997 a group of journalists was taken to a secret location in south London and shown that Humphrey was still alive and well. Pictures of the cat posing with copies of the day's newspapers were published and reports indicated that he had put on weight.. In retirement Little was heard about Humphrey over the next few years, leading many to infer that he had died. The Daily Telegraph made a Freedom of Information Act request for documents relating to him in early 2005, which led to more information about his time at Downing Street coming to light. In March 2005, in its report about Humphrey, the Telegraph lamented \\"Where Humphrey is now ‚Äì or even whether he is still with us ‚Äì remains a mystery. 'I am not having much luck,' a Cabinet Office spokesman confessed last night. His official minder has not heard from him in seven years.\\" However, on 22 July 2005, The Independent reported that \\"the 17 year old mouser is alive and well and living in South London.\\" No further details were given in the text, which was part of a larger feature about celebrity pets. In March 2006, a spokesman for Tony Blair reported that Humphrey had died during the previous week, at the home of the Cabinet Office worker who had been accommodating him. In August 2012 the BBC Radio 4 dramatic series Political Animals featured Humphrey, focusing on the Blair years. Successor In September 2007, the first Downing Street cat since Humphrey was introduced; Sybil moved from Edinburgh with Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and family. She shared a thespian name like her predecessor, being named after Sybil Fawlty from Fawlty Towers. Sybil returned to Edinburgh in early 2009 as she did not settle. Sybil died in July 2009. In February 2011, a new cat was welcomed into Downing Street from London's Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. Larry arrived following weeks of speculation about potential pest control measures after a large black rat was seen scuttling past Number 10. In popular culture Humphrey appeared in the popular British political satire Spitting image. Humphrey was portrayed as a cat who would irritate the then Prime Minister John Major, by criticising his government. This would lead to a confrontation between Humphry and Major, resulting in Major knocking Humphrey unconscious with a frying pan.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpAQ_K9PV5E&t;=503 See also *Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office *Canadian Parliamentary Cats References External links * Purr-n-Fur UK: Humphrey, the Downing Street cat * Cats in charge: Humphrey Category:1988 animal births Category:2006 animal deaths Category:Individual cats in politics Category:Cats in the United Kingdom Category:Individual animals in the United Kingdom Category:Working cats ","title":"Humphrey (cat)"},{"id":"559908","text":"Lawrence E. \\"Larry\\" Stager (January 5, 1943 ‚Äì December 29, 2017) was an American archaeologist and academic, specialising in Syro-Palestinian archaeology and Biblical archaeology. He was the Dorot Professor of the Archaeology of Israel in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at Harvard University and was Director of the Harvard Semitic Museum. Beginning in 1985 he oversaw the excavations of the Leon Levy Expedition to Ashkelon, the Philistine port city. Education Stager was a first-generation college student from Kenton, Ohio, about fifty miles northwest of Columbus, Ohio.J. D. Schloen, ed. Exploring the Longue Dur√©e: Essays in Honor of Lawrence E. Stager (Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 2009). He was recruited by the Harvard Club of Dayton, Ohio to attend Harvard University, where he graduated a BA magna cum laude in 1965. Stager then received both his MA and PhD from Harvard, where he worked largely under the supervision of Frank Moore Cross and G. Ernest Wright, both students of William F. Albright. The title of his thesis was Ancient Agriculture in the Judaean Desert: A Case Study of the Buq√™'ah Valley in the Iron Age. Academic positions After receiving his PhD, Stager was first employed by the University of Chicago, where he taught and researched for the next fourteen years as a member of the Oriental Institute, first as an instructor (1973-4), then as an assistant (1974-6), associate (1976‚Äì1985), and finally full professor (1985-6). In 1986, Stager returned to Harvard, where he became the inaugural holder of an endowed chair, the Dorot Professorship of the Archaeology of Israel. Stager taught courses in Syro-Palestinian archaeology and Hebrew Bible and was an active professional member of the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR). In 2009, a Festschrift for Stager was published under the title Exploring the Longue Dur√©e: Essays in Honor of Lawrence E. Stager (Ed. J. David Schloen; Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns). Archaeological work Stager's most important archaeological work was conducted through the Leon Levy Expedition to Ashkelon, of which he became the director in 1985. This expedition is one of the largest and lengthiest projects in Israel. The results of the dig have been published in the Harvard Semitic Museum and Eisenbrauns' Ashkelon, a series of ten volumes, the third of which was published in 2011. Prior to his monumental undertakings at Ashkelon, Stager worked on digs at Carthage, Idalion, Gezer, and Tell el-Hesi. Stager generally adhered to the traditional scholarly dating of the \\"United Monarchy\\" of King David and Solomon.

She was the former Performing Arts Director of the Japan Society and the Asia Society and was one of the last surviving members of the team that worked under Douglas MacArthur to write the Constitution of Japan after World War II. Early life and education Born in Vienna on October 25, 1923 and educated in Tokyo, Beate Sirota was the only child of noted pianist Leo Sirota and Augustine (Horenstein) Sirota. Leo, a Ukrainian Jew, had fled war-torn Russia and settled in Austria. Her uncle was conductor Jascha Horenstein.\\"Leo Sirota\\" on the Naxos Records website Sirota's family emigrated to Japan in 1929, when Leo Sirota accepted an invitation to become a professor at the Imperial Academy of Music ‚Äì now Tokyo University of the Arts ‚Äì in Tokyo.Dower, pp. 365-367 She attended the German School in Tokyo for six years, until the age of twelve, when she transferred to American School in Japan (also in Tokyo) as a result of her parents deeming the German School \\"too Nazi\\". Beate Sirota lived in Tokyo a total of ten years before she moved to Oakland, California, in 1939 to attend Mills College, where she was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa Society, and graduated in 1943 with a bachelor's degree in modern languages. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in January 1945. World War II and Japan During World War II, Sirota was completely cut off from her parents in Japan. She later said that in the U.S. in 1940, she was one of only sixty-five Caucasians who were fluent in Japanese.Gordon, Beate Sirota. Commencement address at Mills College, May 14, 2011. \\"Sotomayor, Denzel Washington, GE CEO Speak to Graduates,\\" C-SPAN (US). May 30, 2011; retrieved 2011-05-30. During the war, she worked for the Office of War Information in the Foreign Broadcast Information Service of the Federal Communications Commission. She also worked for Time magazine. As soon as the war ended, Sirota went to Japan in search of her parents, who survived the war as internees in Karuizawa, Nagano. On Christmas Eve, 1945, she was the first civilian woman to arrive in post-war Japan. Assigned to the Political Affairs staff, she worked for Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) Douglas MacArthur's occupation army as a translator. In addition to Japanese, she was fluent in English, German, French, and Russian. When the U.S. began drafting a new constitution for Japan in February 1946, Sirota was enlisted to help and was assigned to the subcommittee dedicated to writing the section of the constitution devoted to civil rights. She was one of only two women in the larger group, the other being economist Eleanor Hadley. Sirota played an integral role, drafting the language regarding legal equality between men and women in Japan, including Articles 14 and 24 on Equal Rights and Women's Civil Rights. Article 14 states, in part: \\"All of the people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin\\". Article 24 includes: > Marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes and it > shall be maintained through mutual cooperation with the equal rights of > husband and wife as a basis. 2) With regard to choice of spouse, property > rights, inheritance, choice of domicile, divorce and other matters > pertaining to marriage and the family, laws shall be enacted from the > standpoint of individual dignity and the essential equality of the sexes. These additions to the constitution were vital to women's rights in Japan. \\"Japanese women were historically treated like chattel; they were property to be bought and sold on a whim,\\" Gordon said in 1999. Sirota, as interpreter on MacArthur's staff, was the only woman present during the negotiations between the Japanese Steering Committee and the American team. In 1947, Sirota was a target of Major General Charles A. Willoughby's year-long investigation of leftist infiltration, in which he tried to construct a case against Sirota, charging her with advancing the Communist cause within the new government of Japan.Bendersky, p. 400. Performing arts After returning to the United States with her parents, in 1948, Beate Sirota married Lieutenant Joseph Gordon, who had been chief of the interpreter‚Äìtranslator team for the military intelligence section at the Allied Supreme Commander GHQ and was also present for the negotiations on the constitution. Settling in New York in 1947, she took a number of jobs, including one at Time magazine. Gordon eventually returned to her primary interest, the performing arts. She had studied ballet, modern, ethnic, and folk dance, as well as piano and drama in Tokyo and at Mills. While raising her two young children, she joined the reactivated Japan Society in New York City in 1954 as Director of Student Programs, providing career and job counseling to Japanese students in New York. One of the students was Yoko Ono, with whom she maintained a lifelong friendship. She also worked with visual artists, arranging exhibits and lecture- demonstrations, including the first American visit of the renowned woodblock artist, Shik≈ç Munakata. In 1958 she was appointed the Society's Director of Performing Arts. In this capacity she introduced a number of Japanese performing artists to the New York public, helping to develop many careers. Among these artists were Toshi Ichiyanagi, now one of Japan's foremost composers and Suzushi Hanayagi, whom she introduced to the theater director Robert Wilson, with whom Hanayagi collaborated on the Knee Plays, and other works. In addition, in 1960, Gordon became a consultant to the Asia Society performing arts program, expanding her activities from Japan to the other countries of Asia. Gordon was also a consultant and adviser to producers such as Harold Prince for his production of the Stephen Sondheim musical, Pacific Overtures. In the early 1960s, she was influential in bringing koto music to the attention of Americans by introducing composer Henry Cowell to the great Japanese koto player, Kimio Eto. Cowell subsequently wrote a concerto for koto and orchestra for Eto which was presented by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra in New York, Philadelphia, and on tour. Gordon also produced the first Asian performances at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Gordon's travels in search of authentic performing arts from Asia took her to such remote areas as Purulia in West Bengal, India, and Kuching in Sarawak, Malaysia, where she sought out indigenous performing artists to bring to universities, museums, and other cultural venues in New York and across the United States and Canada. Over the years, Gordon produced 39 tours by 34 companies from 16 countries. These performances, which were seen by an estimated 1.5 million Americans in some 400 cities and towns in 42 states, brought new ways of experiencing Asian performing arts to audiences throughout the country. They also intensified the post-World War II Asian influence on American art, design, music, literature, and theater. For the media, Gordon produced and hosted a series of 12 half-hour programs on the Japanese arts broadcast on New York's Channel 13 and served as commentator for a series of four hour-long programs featuring traditional and popular music from Japan, China, India, and Thailand which were broadcast on Channel 31, New York City's municipal television station. She also produced 29 video tapes and five films televised nationally. For the Nonesuch Records Explorer Series, she produced eight albums of Asian music.
