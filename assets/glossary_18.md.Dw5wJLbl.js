The game is about guiding a group of astronauts to safety. It was released on Steam and later on the iOS App Store.  Gameplay  The challenge for the player is to guide a group of astronauts to safety, and so complete a level. This is done by using directional cues, portals and time manipulation. The player has to guide the astronauts (which move automatically) to colored end spaces in a variety of environments (such as crystal caves and hazy forests). The player has to complete the level in a certain time frame. As the player advances through a level they can go back in time to find a better solution. There is also a restart button which allows the player to start the level from the beginning.  Reception  The game received mostly positive reviews. Gamezebo gave the game 4 stars out of 5 praising the fact it was \\"very challenging and will satisfy hardcore puzzle fans\\" and that the game had \\"nice visuals and soundtrack\\" while criticizing the fact it is \\"very challenging and may frustrate casual puzzle fans\\" and has no instructions. GameGrin gave the game a rating of 4.5 out of 10 saying the game \\"bludgeons freedom into a pulp and annihilates any semblance of player choice, denying any puzzle experimentation and making for one extremely unappealing game\\".

The work has been exclusively performed by the Acacia Quartet. The work chronicles Chan's 6 years as an HIV/AIDS activist at the height of the epidemic in Australia, including importing experimental medications from Los Angeles to Sydney. It is the longest string quartet ever written in Australia About The 90-minute work was sketched in the during the years 1991-1996, but only completed some 20 years later. It contains reflections of historic events, portraits of famous activist friends now dead, and unusual effects like the use of police whistles to recall street demonstrations by ACT UP, the direct action protest group of which Lyle Chan was a core member. In those crisis years, he and fellow activists couriered AIDS treatments from the US that were unavailable in Australia, fiercely lobbied federal government to approve experimental treatments more quickly, and collaborated with drug companies to design clinical trials of promising new treatments. The Melbourne Recital Centre, one of the first presenters of the work, states, \\"This work tells the story of how activists transformed a stigmatized, fatal disease. Like the autobiographical quartets of Steve Reich or Shostakovich, Lyle Chan's AIDS memoir is in turn harrowing and touching but ultimately an intensely uplifting story of a community that fought against all odds for their lives and won.\\" \\"Activism is an attempt to reach some kind of normality\\", he reflected in a 2014 interview, \\"that you feel is being denied for some reason. Once it became clear, between 1994 and 1996, that we were no longer fighting against a constant backdrop of death, it became possible to imagine a future where every day was not a state of emergency.\\" Asked about the message of the work, he replied, \\"I don't have an overt 'message', aside from the message that we all should bring beauty into the world, in our deeds and in our relationships. Sometimes, there are obstacles to be overcome in order to do that. For two decades, AIDS was one such obstacle to beauty and love.\\" A typical complete performance lasts 2 hours, without interval. In performance, Lyle Chan speaks onstage between sections of the music ‚Äì a narrative entirely from memory, telling vivid stories about the events and people of this era.  Structure  The work is made up of 17 sections played continuously, lasting approximately 90 minutes. In performances where the composer narrates between sets of music, the entire show lasts 2 hours without any breaks. It is the longest string quartet ever written in Australia. # In September The Light Changes # ACT UP, Part 1 # ACT UP, Part 2 # Dextran Man, Part 1 # Mark and Adrian Are Her Sons, Part 1 # Mark and Adrian Are Her Sons, Part 2 # Mark and Adrian Are Her Sons, Part 3 # Dextran Man, Part 2 # Et tu Bruce # Night Vigil # After Night Vigil # Dextran Man, Part 3 # Tony-ony Macaroni, Part 1 # Tony-ony Macaroni, Part 2 # Don't Leave Me This Way # Towards Elysium # Fairy Tale Ending  Notable performances  Organised by the presenter Music By The Sea, the world premiere performance of the entire work took place on 5 July 2014 at the Sandgate Town Hall in Brisbane, Australia. The Sydney premiere occurred on 18 July of the same year, organised by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation as a live broadcast concert from its Eugene Goossens Hall in Ultimo. Preceding the performance, ABC Classic FM's presenter Julian Day interviewed the composer on air amid breaking news that Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 had been shot down over the Ukraine while carrying passengers destined for the 20th International AIDS Conference that was to be held in Melbourne only a few days later. The performance was dedicated to those killed on Flight MH17 and their loved ones. At the time of the broadcast, a large number of international media reports claimed that over 100 of the passengers were conference delegates. It was subsequently confirmed that the true number of conference delegates on the flight was 6, but it included the scientist Dr Joep Lange, known for his pioneering research on combination therapy to treat HIV infection. Melbourne Recital Centre organised a complete performance in conjunction with the 20th International AIDS Conference on 23 July 2014. The North American premiere took place on 22 June 2016 in Vancouver, Canada, at the invitation of Pride In Art Society for its annual Queer Arts Festival. Other notable performances Along with Dextran Man, Part 1, the 14-minute section Don't Leave Me This Way was performed at the National Gallery of Victoria's exhibition When This You See Remember Me, a retrospective of the work of artist David McDiarmid. This section relates to the underground drug trials that Chan helped organise and in particular tells the story of how the experimental lipid amphotericin was obtained to treat McDiarmid's lymphoma. Chan was one of McDiarmid's medical carers in the year leading to the artist's death from AIDS-related complications in May 1995. The performance was preceded by a 40-minute conversation between the composer and Justice Michael Kirby on stage. Several excerpts were performed by Acacia Quartet on the Global Village stage of the 2014 International AIDS conference.  Reception  The Quartet has met with widespread critical and audience acclaim. In its review, The Age described the work as \\"triumphantly articulating a story of humanity amid the gloom of disaster ‚Ä¶ sometimes words can fail to adequately describe what one witnesses.\\" Limelight Magazine called it \\"A crushingly powerful work of musical history ‚Ä¶ A towering piece.\\" SBS newscaster Anton Enus wrote in his personal Twitter account: \\"Impressive, admirable, so very moving.\\" Renowned American composer John Corigliano said, \\"Lyle Chan's string quartet is a very ambitious work born out of a seemingly endless plague. Its composer has taken his experiences of living through the enormous tragedy of AIDS and from them has molded a serious and deeply felt work of art.\\" The work was the subject of a half-page feature article in The Australian. In December 2015, LA Weekly contacted Lyle Chan to obtain permission to quote the AIDS Memoir Quartet's program notes about Jim Corti (the real identity of 'Dextran Man' referred to in the music), stating \\"Chan's post is a fascinating chronicle of what people were willing to do to be of service to a cause, including manufacturing caplets of ddC (\\"the most illegal thing Jim had ever done\\") when the FDA refused to approve it and the pharmaceutical companies refused to expand clinical trials. In a second post, Chan recalls when the supply of ddC was interrupted by the '92 L.A. riots ‚Äî Corti, who was white, lived in South Central.\\"  References  Compositions for string quartet HIV/AIDS activists HIV/AIDS in Australia Classical music in Australia ","title":"AIDS Memoir Quartet"},{"id":"53458433","text":"Tayla Thorn (born 31 May 1998) is an Australian rules footballer who played for Adelaide and Gold Coast in the AFL Women's (AFLW).

Amir Mir M. and Daniel Lanehttp://www.telfer.uottawa.ca/en/directory/professors/lane-daniel from 2005 to 2008 at the University of Ottawa, Canada. While Mir was working at the Harvard University, School of Public Health department of Health Policy and Management as a research associate, an opportunity arrived for studying the Axiomatic Design of Complex Systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston (2009) USA. This opportunity provided Mir an idea to start a new research based on using the tools and concept of the Axiomatic design on Surveillance of a Complex System, specifically in Surveillance of Partially Observable Systems. A partially observable system, unlike a system that clearly displays a full state of its components at any given time, attends to display the invisibility of one or more of its external or internal components at any given time. As technology expends, reliability, performance and safety becomes more and more important. Surveillance of system behavior helps to track hazards and performance. Surveillance is a method used as a tool to help understanding or control the impact of new products or technology. Surveillance is the monitoring of responses and adverse effects. System surveillance is the process of monitoring the performance of objects, a population, or process within a system to understand or to achieve a desired standard of performance. The simplest components of surveillance are observation, examination, analysis and supervision. The conventional method of Surveillance does not apply for a partially visible system. Therefore, a new method is required to observe such complex system at any time given. The Surveillance of a partially observable system offers a mathematical model that uses Markov chains, paired with a Bayesian updating function. The method estimates the statistical impacts of surveillance observations and modified surveillance policies.  Surveillance of Partially Observable Systems on Genetically Modified (GM) Foods  There are many systems that can be considered as partially observable due to their unknown or partially known structures or the nature of their unknown products and/or partially known results. The impacts of the consumption of genetically modified food (GM) are an example of a system that is only partially observable. The safety of genetically modified foods (GM) products has caused much controversy. Absence of sufficient and reliable information prevents neither certain confidence about the harmlessness of product consumption, nor any certain conclusion to merit a ban for fear of harm. The lack of any reliable or conclusive post- market observation and consumption effects information, make it difficult to establish a global protocol for such products. This paper introduces a model for the analysis of partially observable information from the surveillance of post-market consumption of systems such as genetically modified foods (GM) products. This model uses Markov Chains, paired with a Bayesian updating function to estimate the statistical impacts of surveillance observations and modified surveillance policies. A case study on population health status is used as an illustrative example, which is modeled to demonstrate the impact of policy interventions on simulated data. A cost decision analysis model is also applied to illustrate the impact of policy intervention costs. The model uses a first order Markov chain to estimate the period-over-period change in health status and a Bayesian updating procedure to estimate the population health status based on observations from post-market surveillance. The results show how observation samples can be used to provide information on system changes and improvements.  Axiomatic Design for Complex Systems  Axiomatic design is an alternative designing method that has a new perspective and different look into methodology of a system design.[3] Designing a complex system, interacting with a large number of components with some nonlinear behaviors. It requires a surgical mechanism with a critical care to investigate the relationships between all sub-systems of each part interacting with a larger component. This method looks into each sub-system to view a larger picture of the main system. It interacts and forming relationships with its environment. The method applies some principles to a number of case studies and industrial examples ranging from large scale systems to nano-scale systems. It could be also used for the designs of the health-care systems.

She studied chemistry and biology at the University of Jena and received a doctorate in biology. She died on 18 December 2016 at the age of 97.  Business career  Pohl-Stroher's grandparents, Franz and Marie Stroeher, founded the hair care and cosmetics company Wella AG in the 19th century.

The Cloisters, New York Closed view The Reliquary Shrine is an especially complex 14th century container for relics, now in The Cloisters, New York. It is made from translucent enamel, gilt-silver and paint, and dated to c 1325‚Äì50. Although first mentioned in a convent in Budapest, its style and influences betrays French craftsmanship. It has been proposed to be attributed by the Met to Jean de Toul written Jehan de Touyl in one French source from 1328, a French goldsmith about whom little is known, but who is associated with a small number of works with similar stylistic characteristics.Parker, 350 The centerpiece shows the enthronedHer position is indicated by the fact that she is seated, in what seems to be a church, surrounded by attendant angels and saints.

Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 8 April, 2017 Description Detail of the Virgin and Child. Note her unnaturally large hands The shrine is one of four extant silver-gilt and enamel examples from the early 14th century.Wixom, 62 The central panel shows the Virgin and Child surrounded by angels, placed in an elaborate Gothic architectural shrine. The Virgin is enthroned and suckles the child Jesus at her breast. It is made from gilt-silver, translucent enamel, with painted surfaces. The work seems to imitate the space of a church. The arches and vaults are described in gilded silver, the wing panels are in enamel and in their colourisation, figuration and perspective, seem intended to evoke stained-glass windows. Created in the International Gothic style. Detail of the right-hand angel in the central panel, with biblical figures in niches, horizontally along the right border The Virgin and Christ child are situated in an arched canopy, flanked by two angels. The complex and minutely described architectural space seems to emulate an early 14th-century church. The edges of the central panel are lined with a series of statuesque saints in niches. Each of the two outer wings contains three foldable panels, showing scenes from the Life of the Virgin and Christ Child. Each of the six wing panels is crowned by a triangular panel containing a musical angel.\\"Reliquary Shrine\\". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 11 March 2017 The setting contains a number of elements reflective of contemporary Gothic architectural design, including ribbed vaults, buttress with figures of saints, and trefoil arches. Given its small scale, it was probably intended as a household object, for private prayer. Provenance Its elaborate structure and supreme craftsmanship indicates that it was commissioned by members of the upper echelon of contemporary society. The shrine is first recorded in 17th- and 18th-century inventories of the convent of the Poor Clares nunnery at Buda, in today's Budapest. It was likely purchased in the 14th century by Elizabeth of Poland, Queen of Hungary, who founded the convent.Barnet, 99 It was in the collection of the baroness Clarice de Rothschild, before it was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1962.

Baxter also wrote an authorised sequel to Wells' novel The Time Machine, The Time Ships.The Guardian The Massacre of MankindTor.com The Massacre of MankindIrish Times The Massacre of MankindOxford Culture Review The Massacre of Mankind Plot summary =Book I: The Return of the Martians= The Jovians are a race even more ancient than the Martians, who watched the Earth- Mars war with disapproval. 1920, New York City: Julie Elphinstone meets Major Eric Eden, a POW in the Martian war of 1907. He has come from Britain to try and get her to take a call from her ex-husband's brother Walter Jenkins, the author of the \\"Narrative\\" (i.e. The War of the Worlds). Her husband was Frank Jenkins. Since the war, telescopes are only permitted to be operated by the government, so as to prevent panic. There is also a war between the Germans and the Russians called the Schlieffen War. While waiting for Walter's call, Julie and Eric meet with Albert Cook, the artillery man that Walter made infamous in his memoir. When the call finally comes, it's Walter's doctor; he is being treated for neurasthenia, a sort of \\"heat stroke\\" caused by his interactions with the Martians. Dr. Meyers believes that it's actually shell shock, and points out many instances from Walter's book that account for it: Walter doesn't name himself or his wife, the murder of the curate, etc. He recommends therapy, mandated by the prime minister. Walter tells Julie he wants to meet her in London; he has grave news from the sky. Julie, Eric Eden, Philip Paris, and Albert Cook take passage on a steamer to England. They arrive to see German soldiers everywhere (the British sided with the Kaiser in the war against France, Russia, and Belgium, and they may attack America next). Philip takes them to the site where one of the cylinders fell. Here, men have reverse-engineered the crab-like Martian machine and are using it to make aluminium. Men also figured out how the heat ray and some other machines work; Einstein believes the power source is battery packs that use atomic energy. The black smoke and red weed left the land toxic. Julie is taken aback by how totalitarian London has become. The leader, Brian Marvin, has statues and pictures of himself everywhere, and the whole country is 100% dedicated to gearing up for the next Martian attack. Julie visits a Martian monument and passes out when she thinks she sees it turn its head. The next morning, Julie et. al. meet at Ogilvy's former observatory, along with Carolyne (Walter's ex) and Frank (Walter's brother). Walter calls from Germany to say that they saw sigils on Jupiter like they saw on Mars and Venusthough they're of a different design. They believe that the Martians may use the sigils to signal possession of the planets to the Jovians. Observers also saw the Martian cannons firing again, but instead of just one, there were ten cannons that each fired ten shots. He thinks they'll return to England to gather their fallen comrades and technology. Frank is drafted the next day and London fills with soldiers and guns to prepare for war. He meets a VAD named Verity Bliss, who tells him he's the one in charge of their group. They board a train for Uxbridge. Upon arrival, he's told that the cylinder will be dropping at 19:00, and that there will be 50+ landing around the country. These Martian tubes did not slow their descent as the previous ones had, acting as kinetic missiles instead of transport vessels. Anything and anyone within a mile of the impact craters is destroyed instantly. Nearly half of Britain's military is wiped out. Frank and Verity help the survivors, though there are few. The nearest cylinder drops 13 miles from London, so Julie doesn't find out that half the army was destroyed until she reads it in the paper the next day. The shops close and rationing starts. Frank and his group help wherever they can. The next round of cylinders will hit again at midnight. Albert Cook finds Frank on the frontline right before 12. The cylinder hits right on time, but instead of taking 19 hours for the Martians to surface like last time, the Martians pop out right away and start blasting their heat ray. Within minutes, 4 tripods emerge from the hole and take out the guns and artillery. Bert tells them to lie on the ground; anyone who submits is safe, because the Martians have already won and are saving people to be harvested. The next day, Julie spots a Martian flying machine over Londonthough this time it is flanked by human planes. Prime Minister Marvin calls for all able-bodied men to come to the King's Line (a makeshift defense line built around the Martians' landing site) to start digging trenches. Frank, Verity, et al are rescued by a farm woman named Mildred, who arrives with a horse-drawn buggy to take them back to her farm; it seems the Martians only fire on machines. The Martians deploy their crab-like machine to start building a cordon of their own. Mildred takes Frank to the Manor of Lady Bonneville where Lt. Fairfield is waiting on him. The Martians sent out 200 tripods and took out all the military bases in southern England in mere hoursnot to mention all the roads and telephone wires they destroyed. That night, the tripods from all over start to converge on London. German bombers light them up, but they are no match for the heat ray. Julie and her sister-in-law Alice flee London and make for France. Winston Churchill, the Secretary of State for War, remains in the city to oversee its defense. Eric Eden waits in the trenches, ready to fight the straggling tripods that survive the shelling barrage. Unfortunately, their heat rays explode most of the shells in mid-air (though a handful of tripods do go down), and the Martians begin systematically torching the trenches as well. The call for retreat is issued right before the Martians reach Eric. Churchill's secret plan is to use heat rays augmented with human tech, rolled out on the backs of trucks. Unfortunately, the guns won't fire on Martian targets. In a last ditch effort, Eric Eden turns one of the guns onto another gun and blasts it, creating a nuclear explosion that takes out a handful of tripodsbut the remaining 40 press on towards London. Julie and Alice travel to Rotherhithe, where Alice has an in with the union leader there. The Martians systematically destroy London, encountering little resistance along the way. Many Londoners escape or take shelter though, thanks to the advanced planning by Marvin's regime. =Book II: England under the Martians= Two years later: the Martians control England, though they mostly remain in their cordon. Julie, in Paris, gets a letter from Walter asking her to come to Berlin; she reluctantly decides to go. In Germany the citizens live their lives normally, despite the Martian incursion only 100 miles away, and despite the ongoing Russian-German war. Walter asks Julie (per General Eden and Minister of War Churchill) to go into the Martian cordon to try and communicate with them using abstract symbols, like the sigils displayed by the Martians and the Jovians. Julie takes a boat from Germany to England, part of a larger convoy that includes Eric Eden. About halfway to England, the fleet encounters Martian war machines at Dogger Bank. The Martians seem to have no trouble spotting vessels through the clouds or the water (u-boats). A naval battle ensues, and the Martians take out about 30% of the fleet, but the Martians are ultimately defeated by a shelling barrage. Julie makes it past without incident in her much smaller boat. Julie arrives in England. She takes a train through a \\"Winstonville\\", one of the small pop-up towns formed by people on the run from the Martians, and named after Winston Churchill, the governor of London ever since General Marvin died during the Martian invasion. At Portsmouth, Julie is taken to a hospital and inoculated against diseases that have been running rampant, like cholera, etc., and is also given some experimental drugs as well. Afterwards, Eden reveals to her that she's actually been infected with a virus that should kill the Martians. She is to find their feeding vat of human blood and \\"poison the well.\\" She is not happy to have been deceived. Julie makes her way down the Thames, which has flooded many of the London streets. Her escorts take her to an open manhole and explain that they will be traveling via sewer to escape the Martian's view while they head into Martian territory. They arrive the next day in Hampsted, where Eden is waiting for them. They take a bus to the Trench: a series of three 50 ft trenches built around the Martian Cordon. A network of caves has been built into the side where the troops are housed. It has been fairly effective at dealing with the tripods, if not the flying machines. Early the next morning, the Martians attack. Julie, escorted by Ben Gray, Ted Lane, et. al., escape into the tunnels, heading into Martian territory. A Martian handling machine burrows into the tunnel ahead of them and kills a handful of the soldiers with its heat ray. Gray detonates a grenade, killing himself and the Martian, allowing the surviving few to escape into Martian territory. When they surface, Julie's ex Frank picks everyone up in a car and takes them to the farmed fields. Julie does not reveal her true mission to Frank. In the riverbeds, the red weed is choking out all other vegetation and life, and changing the air composition to be more Mars-like. The group encounters German soldiers who have taken to potato farming; the Martians ignore them as long as they don't attack. They show Julie the other 2 species that are working nearby: tall, translucent, skinny, humanoid Martians bred by the other Martians as cattle; and more squat, brown beings from Venus. Frank gets Julie set up in Abottsdale and they have dinner with the local dignitaries. Everyone is quite insistent that she donate blood, so the next day she visits Verity Bliss to do so. Verity explains that the Martians pick people off at random, so to try and curb the abductions, they leave blood offerings. Julie is aghast and decides not to donate, but she tells Verity of her mission and asks Verity to arrange a meeting with Albert Cook. Verity takes her to an inn to meet a man named Marriott, who leads an underground resistance. He agrees to help her find Cook if she will help them dynamite a Martian dam. Julie, Verity, and 2 of Marriott's associates attempt to transport the dynamite to the dam, but they're intercepted by a fighting machine. The dynamite detonates when the Martian fires its heat ray, and Julie is thrown into the water. The red weed nearly strangles her, but she is saved by a nude, hair-covered \\"man\\" with webbed digits and gills. Julie awakens 24 hours later. Verity tells her that she was saved by a Cytherean, a man from Venus. They're not as bright as humans, but can swim very well, and \\"Charlie\\" even helped Verity put her arm in a sling. Charlie wears a cross that he got from a priest that was trying to covert the Cythereans. After a couple days convalescing, they are attacked by a fighting machine that is harvesting people. As it's about to grab them, Julie notices that Albert Cook seems to be a symbiotic passenger and calls to him. He remembers her from the first war, though he still holds a grudge against Walter. He tells her that helping the Martians harvest their prey is how he's adapted to the apocalypse. She explains that she's been sent to communicate with the Martians and he says to meet him at the Wycombe caves later. Julie and Verity go to the caves and meet Bert, his wife Mary, and their baby. They tell him they're going into the Martian Redoubt to try and communicate with the Martians using Walter's sigil pictures, but need to know how Bert gets in without being attacked. He says that he sold out some other human's hiding place to endear himself to the Martians, and now he does it for them every daythough one day he plans to turn on them. He wears a wig and gaudy costume so the Martians can easily recognize him, as they have trouble differentiating humans. He saved Mary from a fighting machine and that's why she stays with him. Bert agrees to take them to the Redoubt if they'll take his daughter Belle away from the caves; the Martians are selectively breeding people to get rid of the strongest and he thinks they'll take his baby. At the Redoubt, a Martian gives them a quick once-over and they're left to their own devices once it recognizes Bert. The Martians are digging ever further into the Earth, as well as creating more machines. Bert takes them to the holding tanks where they keep Cythereans and humans for \\"the drips\\". He throws arrow heads into the human tank (Martians don't recognize them as weapons) so they can commit suicide, a slight reprieve against being drained alive. Albert next shows them the experiments the Martians perform on adults and children; they're trying to selectively breed people that will sacrifice their children to save themselves. They also see experiments where they are trying to grow/fuse Martians out of/with humans. Eventually they come to the feeding hole, where the Martians have humans hung upside-down from scaffolding while they inject the human's blood directly into their Martian bodiespresumably to flush out waste in a kind out transfusion. Julie has a revelation on how to stop all the Martians instead of just poisoning these ones. She sees more Martian cylinders falling to Earth, this time over America. =Book III: Worlds at War= Walter observes another tenfold increase in the firing of the Martian canons: a thousand ships are launched at Earth, heading for America. Harry Kane, a journalist, is at an end of the world party in Long Island when the next round of cylinders drop. He meets an injured military captain named Bill Woodward and a woman named Marigold Rafferty, an assistant to Thomas Edison, who is creating super weapons to fight off the Martians. Rafferty leaves to find Edison, and Harry and Bill wait for her to return. She shows up the next morning and says Edison has been evacuated to Manhattan. The Martians start moving toward Manhattan themselves, and another round off cylinders crashes down in LA. In England, Julie asks Bert to take her to see Eric Eden. When they meet him, Eric is about to launch an attack using his \\"landships\\" , but Julie says a better plan is to try and change the Martians sigils carved into the earth instead. He agrees to let her attempt it, and she and Verity come with him on his ship \\"Bodicea.\\" The Martians destroy L.A. The Bodicea landship is like a giant land submarine covered with turrets. It rests on three, forty-foot diameter wheels, and is crafted from Martian cylinders to resist their heat ray. A fleet of the ships attack the Martian cordon, and even manage to take out multiple fighting machinesbut not without casualties. Eden tells Julie to go on foot to Marriott, while he takes the fleet to Amersham to attack the Martian control center. Verity stays behind, though Julie says she ultimately won't survive the battle. Harry, Marigold, and Bill head to Central Park. Bill decides to hang back with the army they to assist Major Patton, and tells Harry and Marigold to head south, away from the direction the Martians are headed. Just then, the Martians cross the river into Manhattan and the battle begins. The Martians destroy Melbourne, Peking, Manhattan, Constantinople, and Africa. The Germans and the Russians unite against the Martians. In Germany, Walter decides to head to Berlin, directly into the heart of the oncoming Martian attack. A German bomber outfitted with fire bombs made from Martian technology manages to fell a few fighting machines, but the Martians ultimately prevail. Walter flees the city. In NY, Bill Woodward returns with flux bombs created by Thomas Edison using Martian technology. They detonate a couple near a Martian pit and they are extremely effective in crippling the fighting machines. In retaliation, the Martian flying machines begin dispensing their deadly black smoke. Abruptly, they stop. Julie's plan was successful: they detonated numerous explosives to change the Martian sigils into the circular Jovian symbols. Within 2 hours, the Martians have withdrawn; the Jovians leave their circular sigil on the moon. =Book IV: Mars on Earth= 14 years later, the Martians are still on Earth but no one knows where. Carolyne, Walter's ex, comes to Julie and asks her to look after him. Julie heads to the Amersham pits to visit him. At the Redoubt, Walter takes Julie a half mile into the earth to the underground Martian city. He speculates that this is how they live on Mars, that they have no secrets because of their telepathy, and that they are all treated as equals. The British Martians built a canon and shot themselves back to Mars; reports say that other Martians moved to the Earth's poles where the climate is more Mars-like. Julie, Walter, Eric Eden, and some others take a German flying machine to the arctic. There, Walter shows them the active Martian pit and explains what all the red weed is there for: it's removing the air, which is why the Earth's climate has been changing. He thinks with the Jovians watching, they are forced to merely colonize, and that humans should work with them instead of against. When Earth-Mars opposition comes around again, the Martians do not launch any cylinders. The war of the worlds is over.

Hill's research focused on the chemistry of enzymes, with particular specialization in glycosyltransferases and glycobiology. Hill was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974, the National Academy of Sciences in 1975, the Institute of Medicine in 1978. He served on the editorial board of the scientific journal Journal of Biological Chemistry beginning in 1965 and as associate editor from 1988 to 2012, where he initiated a regular feature series called \\"Classics\\" in which the journal reprinted selected papers of high historical significance. Hill died on November 29, 2012. Early life and education Hill was born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1928. He was an undergraduate at the University of Kansas and received a B.S. in chemistry in 1949. He remained there for graduate work under the supervision of Russell Mills, and received his Ph.D. in 1954. He then worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Utah with Emil L. Smith. Academic career Hill joined the faculty at the University of Utah in 1956. Philip Handler, then chair of the biochemistry department at Duke University School of Medicine, recruited Hill to move to Duke. Hill moved in 1961 and remained at Duke for the rest of his career. He was named to the James B. Duke professorship in 1965 and served as department chair from 1969 to 1993, succeeding Handler after the latter assumed the presidency of the National Academy of Sciences. Hill was active in service and leadership roles in scientific societies, particularly the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, of which he was president in 1976. He served on the editorial boards of several journals and had a particularly long association with the Journal of Biological Chemistry. He joined the editorial board in 1965 and became associate editor in 1988, a role he kept after his retirement from Duke and until shortly before his death in 2012. At JBC he initiated and co-curated the JBC Classics series, which reprinted papers from the journal archives of particularly high scientific impact. Along with Smith and Handler, Hill co-edited a foundational textbook in biochemistry from 1968 to 1978. Research Hill developed an interest in protein chemistry during his postdoctoral work and became known for his studies of hemoglobin while at Utah. He made major contributions to the study of immunoglobulin structure and was particularly influential in the field of glycobiology, which became a major focus of his work after he and collaborating scientists discovered that lactose synthetase contains a glycosyltransferase enzyme.

The game pitted the Missouri Valley Vikings and the East Texas State Lions (now Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCommerce). This was the first time the bowl was played before New Year's Day, as organizers wanted to \\"attract television coverage in the future\\". The December game date made this the second of two Tangerine Bowls played in calendar year 1958. Background The University at Buffalo's first bowl bid was to this game. The Tangerine Bowl Commission hoped that the Orlando High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), which operated the stadium, would waive its rule that prohibited integrated sporting events. When it refused, the team unanimously voted to skip the bowl because its two black players (halfback Willie Evans and end Mike Wilson) would not have been allowed on the field. Missouri Valley entered the game with an 8‚Äì0 record, and had previously played to a tie in the 1956 Tangerine Bowl. East Texas State entered the game with a 9‚Äì1 record, and had recorded two wins and a tie in three prior Tangerine Bowl appearances. Game summary In wet conditions, the teams played a scoreless first quarter. In the second quarter, East Texas scored first but missed the extra point, allowing Missouri Valley to take a 7‚Äì6 lead when they scored a touchdown and converted their extra point. East Texas scored another touchdown, but again missed the extra point, and had a 12‚Äì7 lead at halftime. After a scoreless third quarter, East Texas scored two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, successfully making one two-point conversion, to win by a final score of 26‚Äì7. Scoring summary Aftermath East Texas would not play again in the postseason until 1972, when they won the NAIA Football National Championship. They then joined NCAA Division II, and have subsequently made several playoff appearances there. Missouri Valley's next postseason appearance would be the Mineral Water Bowl in 1971. They have subsequently appeared several times in the NAIA's postseason playoffs. The University at Buffalo would not appear in a bowl game until the 2009 International Bowl.

Willis was convicted of murder after a 1986 fire in his West Texas home killed two women. He was sentenced to the death penalty. In 2004, Willis was released from prison after new fire investigators examining the case could not reach a determination as to the fire's cause, and they said that there was no evidence that the fire had been an arson case. Background Willis was from New Mexico. Before he was 40 years old, he had been divorced several times, and he had back problems that prevented him from working and made him dependent on food stamps. He developed an addiction to pain medication, and he had three convictions for driving under the influence. Willis had moved to Odessa, Texas, to live with his cousin, Billy Willis. They later moved to the town of Iraan, Texas. On the night of June 10, 1986, Ernest and Billy Willis came home accompanied by two women that they had met that day, Betsy Beleu and Gail Allison. Ernest Willis said that he awoke to the smell of smoke around 4:00 a.m. on June 11. The Willis cousins were able to make it out of the burning house, but the flames had pushed Ernest back when he had tried to rescue Beleu and Allison. Both women died in the fire. Police became suspicious of Ernest, and they arrested Ernest four months later, charging him with murder. Ernest Willis first raised the suspicions of police with his behavior at the scene of the fire; he was smoking as firefighters extinguished the fire, he did not seem to have inhaled much smoke in the fire, and his feet were not burned as police thought they should have been. Later, Willis failed a polygraph examination. Given that they had only circumstantial evidence against him, prosecutors were surprised when they were able to secure a capital murder indictment against him. Trial and imprisonment At trial, Willis appeared cold and emotionless, and prosecutors commented to the jury about his demeanor. Willis did not realize that his behavior was abnormal; after his arrest, for reasons that were unclear, he had been started on high doses of antipsychotic medication. These medications are commonly associated with an apathetic appearance. Willis was convicted of capital murder and sent to death row in August 1987. In 1990, fellow death row inmate David Martin Long gave a three-hour confession to starting the fire in Iraan. He had been involved in some criminal activity with Billy Willis, and he said that he hated Billy. The confession was recorded on video, but Long subsequently refused to testify in court on the matter. The confession generated new interest in the case among attorneys, and appeals lawyers worked to confirm the information in Long's story. An analysis of crime scene evidence indicated that the fire could have involved the use of Everclear and Wild Turkey as accelerants as Long claimed, and Long seemed a plausible suspect because he admitted to previously killing a man by starting a fire.White, pp. 59‚Äì60. Willis met his wife, Verilyn Harbin, while he was on death row. Harbin was the sister of death row inmate Ricky McGinn, who in June 2000 had been the first Texas inmate to receive a stay of execution from governor George W. Bush. (Bush had declined to halt 131 earlier executions during his tenure.) Willis and Harbin corresponded and later met at McGinn's insistence. McGinn was executed in September 2000, and Willis and Harbin were married a month after the execution. As his appeals went by, Willis said that he became depressed and stopped exercising. Willis weighed 185 pounds when he went to prison, and his weight eventually reached 300 pounds. Exoneration After many years of trying to corroborate Long's story, his confession could not be fully supported by the evidence. However, the interest generated by the confession led to new investigations into the Willis case.White, pp. 65‚Äì66. In 2004, a U.S. district judge threw out the conviction, ruling that Willis had been unnecessarily drugged during his trial and that the state suppressed testimony from a psychologist who found that Willis was not dangerous to society. The Texas attorney general and the Pecos County district attorney declined to pursue the case further. The DA said that new investigators labeled the fire's cause as undetermined and could not find any evidence to substantiate an arson case. Willis was released from prison in October 2004. Willis was the eighth Texas death row inmate exonerated since the state resumed executions in 1982, and he was thought to have served the longest sentence on death row among that group.

It was produced by Anjul Nigam, Frank Lotito, and Steve Straka and directed by Frank Lotito. Prior to its theatrical release, the film was originally produced and exhibited in some festivals under the title \\"Good Ol' Boy\\". The movie takes place in 1979, when an Indian family moves to America with hopes of living the American Dream. While their 10-year-old boy Smith falls head-over-heels for the girl next door, his desire to become a \\"good old boy\\" propels him further away from his family's ideals than ever before. The film premiered on June 1, 2015, at the Seattle International Film Festival, where it won the Best of the Fest Top Five. Growing Up Smith went on to win the Audience Awards at the Woodstock Film Festival, Naples International Film Festival, Prescott Film Festival; the Jury Prize at CAAMFest; and the Best Family Film at Garden State Film Festival. It was the Opening Night Film at the Cleveland International Film Festival and the SouthSide Film Festival. The movie had its theatrical release in select cities in the United States on February 3, 2017, and expanded wider on February 10, 2017. Produced for $2 million, it received mostly positive reviews including TIME Magazine's Pick of the Week. Plot Growing Up Smith is a coming-of-age story of Smith, a 10-year-old boy from India growing up in small-town America in 1979. As the boy's family tries to straddle the fine line between embracing the American Dream and preserving their Indian heritage, the awkward little hero sneaks out for a taste of Kentucky Fried Chicken (even though his family is vegetarian), dons a Saturday Night Fever costume, and contends with his parents as they send him to school with a yellow squash instead of a pumpkin to carve for Halloween. And as Smith falls head-over-heels in love with Amy, the girl-next-door, he finds in Amy's father Butch the all-American cowboy he wishes his own father could be. But alas, when Smith goes on a hunting adventure with Butch, Butch injures himself while chasing a doe. Smith's rescuing Butch makes him a local hero, but also strains his relationship with his father. With Butch unable to work, his wife decides to move away from the house and takes Amy with her. Amy, unable to deal with the turmoil in her own family, threatens to run away. Smith leaves the house on his bike to meet up with her, though Butch arrives soon after and prevents her from doing so. Smith's parents, in the meantime, search for him and find his sister making out with a boy. Furious, they condemn his sister to studying, and upon Smith's return banish him back to India after he declares his love for Amy. Nineteen years pass in India, with Smith becoming a neurosurgeon and finding a woman to marry. Smith's wife dies of a complication - though unknown - that Smith himself tries to cure. Smith returns to his hometown in America, where his sister has a family with Patrick (the same boy she was found making out with nineteen years earlier) and lives in the same house as before. Smith reconnects with Butch, and finds out Amy still lives in her grandmother's house as a fourth-grade teacher, though she is unmarried and has a child. The movie concludes with Smith re-affirming his desire to meet Amy and riding out on the same old bike to do so.

Bharathi's wealthy father (Balaiah) wants to donate some of his properties for charity. This is objected to by his nephew (Asokan) who intends to marry Bharati and seize all the properties. When Balaiah threatens to expel Asokan, the latter abducts Balaiah and replaces him with a doppelg√§nger. With the help of the doppelg√§nger, Asokan tries to marry Bharati, who is oblivious to the fact that her father has been abducted. However, Ravichandran successfully exposes Asokan, rescues the real Balaiah and marries Bharati.  Cast  Credits adapted from CIWTF: * Ravichandran * Bharathi * J. P. Chandrababu * T. S. Balaiah * S.

Rodrigo was in the service of the House of Trast√°mara, and was a court composer for Ferdinand I of Aragon when he received the Crown of Aragon in 1412. At Ferdinand's death in 1416, Alfonso V was crowned King of Aragon, and Rodrigo remained in his service under the title ministril de camara. He was sent to visit the Count of Foix and the courts of Navarre and Castile, accompanied by Diego, a singer who also served the Aragonese royalty.\\"Rodrigo de la Guitarra\\". The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. 2nd edition, Oxford, 2001. Rodrigo accompanied Alfonso on a visit to Naples in 1421; while he was away the following year, his wife, Ines Gonzalez, was kidnapped in Valencia, and his house was robbed. The abductors were caught in Seville and punished.M.C. G√≥mez, \\"Some Precursors of the Spanish Lute School\\". Early Music 20 (1992), pp. 583-593. By late 1423 he had returned to Spain, and is recorded as being in Barcelona; he remains in Aragonese records until 1427. He then disappears from the historical record until 1458, when he was one of several instrumentalists who accompanied the Feast of the Assumption in Toledo that year. No surviving works have definitively been attributed to Rodrigo, though it has been suggested that he is the author of Angelorum psalat, a ballade from the Chantilly Codex. In the manuscript, the piece is listed under the name S Uciredor, or Rodericus spelled backwards, and Rodrigo de la Guitarra is the only known musician of the era with that name.Gilbert Reaney, \\"The Manuscript Chantilly, Musee Conde 1047\\".

In Chile he is known also as a scholar in law; in Spain, and especially in Catalonia, he is recognized as a member of the Catalanist movement. Active in Carlism during his youth, he is considered a typical case of a transitional political identity, moving from Carlism to peripheral nationalism. Increasingly concerned with social issues, by the end of his life he sympathized with Francoism and Nazism; he also focused more on his extended family and became increasingly religious. His manuals, published anonymously and related mostly to health, hygiene and cuisine, were fairly popular in Spain in the 1920s and 1930s. Family and youth Sant Boi de Llobregat Joan Bardina Castar√† descended from a working class Catalan family. His paternal grandparents, Josep Bardina and Maria Savarich, lived in a Pyrenean village of Llogaret de Santa Creu, Alto Urgel county, and had 12 children.Anna For√©s i Miravelles, Joan Bardina Castar√†: Educator Catal√°n y sus proyecciones pedag√≥gicas en Chile [PhD thesis Universidad de Barcelona], Barcelona 1996, p. 52, Artur Martorell, Enric Cassasses, Josep Parunella, Joan Bardina I Castar√°.

It is there where he commenced working, first as a locksmith and then as a blacksmith. He married a local girl, Dolores Castar√† Sigr√≥. She also came from a humble, though somewhat better positioned family; her parents, Josep Castar√† Marig√≥ and Mar√≠a Ciur√≥ (originally Sigr√≥) Puig, were handicraftsmen specializing in lace-making; especially the latter was recognized in the town.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 52 The newly married couple had one child, a daughter, before Dolores died. A widower, Joan married her younger sister, Josepa Castar√† Ciur√≥. They had 4 children, Josepa, Joan, Baldiri and Magdalena.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, pp. 52-53 Educated in a kindergarten, at the age of 5 Joan was able to read and write.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 53, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 5-6 In 1884 he moved to elementary school, excelling as an extraordinary student. It was the headmaster who suggested that the boy pursues a more ambitious career. In line with the advice,and somewhat against the standard practice, since the oldest son was supposed to succeed his father in 1887 Joan entered the Barcelona seminary.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 54 He kept collecting awardsFor√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 55 until the mid-1890s,For√©s i Miravelles 1996, pp. 56-58 as a teenager developing interest in photography, folk customs and tourism.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, pp. 55-56 However, path towards an ecclesiastical careerin 1897 he was close to signing up to ecclesiastical service in Mexico, with other seminarians, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 156 was abruptly abandoned. Trying his hand in local journals, Bardina published a pamphlet deemed disrespectful towards the cardinal Sancha y Herv√°s;titled El Cardenal Sancha y otros excesos = media vuelta a la derecha es igual que media vuelta a la izquierda, pero todo lo contrario. Though Bardina signed the piece, published in Lo Mestre Titas, as ‚ÄúValcarlos‚Äù, it was well known who the author was, For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 13, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 155 he considered a heavy reprimand received unfair. When his work on Kant, winning the first prize at a Valencia Seminary contest, was declared arrogant in his home seminary, in 1898exact date is not clear, some sources mention 1896. However, later on Bardina explicitly referred to ‚Äúnine years spent in the seminar‚Äù, For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 13 Bardina left the school.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 59 He obtained bachillerato in 1899 in Instituto de Girona and graduated in philosophy and letters from University of Barcelona in 1900.thesis titled Or√≠genes de la Tradici√≥n y del R√©gimen Liberal, For√©s i Miravelles 1996, pp. 14, 68.

Bardina‚Äôs biographer claims that 1904 was the year when his thesis was published Himself exempted from military service,as the oldest son of a widow, For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 68 in 1901 he volunteered to spare conscription of his sickly brother Baldiri.the sacrifice was useless; Baldiri died shortly afterwards, For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 68-69. The military service was not very challenging anyway; during few months Bardina had to show up at a Barcelona military office to perform bureaucratic duties, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 159-160 At that time he was already trying to make a living by contributing to Barcelona periodicals and publishing own booklets.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 13; since the early 1890s he was used to earning money by winning various literary contests, the first one in 1889, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 18, p. 152.

She married Yen Huai Liu, a fellow PhD student from China.Yen Huai Liu was a famous Chinese explorer of the Great Gobi Desert, a college Professor, author of many college textbooks, and a decorated war hero.

The booklet triggered juridical investigation, which was terminated with no action undertaken, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 158, For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 60 were clearly pointing in this direction. The conspiracy boiled down to few isolated attempts in October 1900, and most of those detained afterwards were Bardina's friends.Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 161, Canal 2005, p. 81 He was profoundly disappointed by ambiguous stand of the claimant,Canal 1996, pp. 67-68 whose official condemnation of those involved alienated Bardina further on.he was present at the funeral of general Soliva in 1901 and later supported his cause as \\"Dr. Leal\\", lambasting general Moore and Carlos VII as traitors, Canal 1996, p. 68 His Carlism started to assume increasingly offshoot tone.

A mother of the children he was teaching was friend to wife of the military governor, and intervened successfully. The governor called Bardina, interviewed him, released him, and made him the teacher of his own children, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 160 In 1903 he openlyin La Veu de Catalunya lambasted Carlist executive for ineptitude.

Apsmav (Jos√© Domingo Corbat√≥), Dr. Leal (Juan Bardina), Los Carlo-traidores, Barcelona 1904 Between Carlism and Catalanism Carlist standard Support for historical territorial identities and for loose organization of state has been major component of the Carlist vision; initially it seemed that Bardina's view on the Catalan question was firmly anchored within this outlook. Feeling profoundly Catalan, in line with orthodox Carlism he confronted the emerging Catalan nationalism as a chaotic medley; lacking tradition and social base, according to Bardina it was advocated by a handful of intellectuals and students,Canal 2005, p. 70 indulging in sectarian exaltation and producing discord.Canal 2005, p. 71 Tending to separatism, they were ‚Äúdescendants of the federalists and republicans in political terms, atheists in religious terms, and Jacobins in social terms‚Äù.Canal 1996, p. 62 The only viable offer for Catalonia ‚Äì Bardina argued - was this of Carlos VII, who already in the 1870s hailed Catalan identity and pledged to restore traditional regional establishments.Canal 1996, p. 63, Canal 2005, p. 70; The Catalanist manifiesto known as Bases de Manresa (1892) was, according to Bardina, copying 20-year-old manifestos of Carlos VII, Canal 2005, p. 76 Writing to Lo Mestre Titas, Bardina engaged in hostile exchange of arguments with Catalanist periodicals La Renaixensa or La Naci√≥ Catalana, lambasting their anti-Carlism.Canal 1996, pp. 57-58, Canal 2005, p. 72 By the turn of the centuries militant and zealous Bardina's tone gave way to somewhat moderated polemics, mostly with Enric Prat de la Riba; discussing differences of programs and contradictory positions of Carlism and nationalist Catalanism, he abandoned earlier venom.Canal 2005, p. 73 Declaring himself a Catalanist and a Carlist at the same time, he criticized the latter for scarce use of Catalan, provincial organization, cu√±erismo,the practice of endorsing cuckoo candidates and giving precedence to Rey over Patria.Canal 1996, p. 59, Canal 2005, p. 74 Bardina's treaties published started to stress an autonomous concept of Catalonia.it was selling well and the second edition soon went to print, Canal 2005, p. 74 Though explicitly rejecting full political independence in favor of a self-government, his vision was mounted in a general, federal or confederal view of an Iberian peninsula as a conglomerate of kingdoms, principates, se√±orios and other entities.Canal 1996, p. 60, Canal 2005, p. 75; according to some scholars, his vision ‚Äúpodr√≠a condensarse en independencia de Catalunya, dentro de una unidad federal ib√©rica‚Äù - Buenaventura Delgado, Ramon Cortada, Josep Gonzalez-Agapito, Claudio Lozano, Joan Bardina.

Starting mid-1900 Bardina was to engage in a variety of Catalanist educational initiatives, be it congresses, lectures, newspapers, schools, self-governmental or private institutions and various associations. Catalanist educator Enric Prat de la Riba Apart from work as a private tutor in well-to-do Barcelona familiesMartorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 160 Bardina had no experience as to education, though he grew enthusiastic about the subject and befriended individuals from the scholarly realm; among them were the Giner de los Rios brothers, chief promoters of Krausism in Spain.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 77 His interest in Catalanism and education led to taking part in the 1903 Congreso Universitario Catal√°n, one of mushrooming Catalanist education-related initiatives.Estudios Universitarios Catalanes, Los Estudios Normales de la Mancomunitat, Patronato Escolar de Barcelona, los Grupos Escolares, El Instituto Escuela, la Escuela Normal de la Generalitat, Escuela Vallparad√≠s, Colegio Mont Cor, Escuela Blanquerna, Escuela Sant Jordi and other, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 162 He offered own views on a future Catalan academic system,Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 163, For√©s i Miravelles 1996, pp. 14, 83-84 declaring also that all primary education should be in Catalan.Claudio Lozano, La pedagogia pol√≠tica de Bardina, [in:] Buenaventura Delgado, Ram√≥n Cortada, Josep Gonzalez-Ag√°pito, Claudio Lozano, Joan Bardina.

Asked by Prat de la Riba to work on the document a few years earlier,El Presupuesto Extraordinario de Cultura y la Instituci√≥n de Cultura Popular (1908) del Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, [in:] filosofia.org service, available here Bardina heavily contributed to its pedagogical section, mostly within the Krausist- Catalanist framework and occasionally assuming a somewhat anti-conservative flavor.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 99 Semana Tr√°gica In the summer of 1909 Barcelona and Catalonia were rocked by Anarchist-dominated and anti-religious riots, known as Semana Tr√°gica. With army restoring order and massive casualties, political establishment took a decisively conservative turn; also Prat de la Riba and La Lliga re-considered the question of alliances and enemies. Liberal educational initiatives became the focus of suspicion. The Presupuesto project was cancelled by the civil governor.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, pp. 99-100 Francesc Ferrer Guardia, founder of Escuela Moderna, was sentenced and executed; also Bardina got ostracized and stigmatized, and police developed interest in his activities.Jim√©nez Serradilla, p. 17 1909 marks the breakup date between him and Prat de la Riba.Lozano 1980, p. 29 Subsidies for Bardina's projects dried out. Unable to cope financially on their own, both Escola de Mestres and Collegio del Remei closed in 1910;Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 166-181 Bardina became sort of an outcast. At the crossroads Paris, 1912 Cut off from public money, Bardina ensured private support. In 1911 the Dural couple, owners of a well- to-do trading company, agreed to finance a new school. It materialized as Instituci√≥n Spencer;named after Herbert Spencer Bardina, apart from having been a headmaster, taught math, geography, languages and history. The enterprise was largely a private Durall tuition affair, as the only alumni known were their numerous children and Bardina's own oldest daughter. For financial reasons or reasons which are not clear, the school closed after just one year, in 1912.Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 183-185, For√©s i Miravelles 1996, pp. 135-137 Bardina found himself in financial dire straits, especially that creditors of Escola de Mestres threatened him with legal action.the school closed with 30,000 ptas in debt, Jim√©nez Serradilla, p. 16 With life in Barcelona becoming unbearable, he pondered upon starting an entirely new life elsewhere.Jim√©nez Serradilla, p. 16 In 1912 with some of his former alumni he moved to Paris to learn the French educational system, the stay financed initially with private money; having obtained public grant,Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 186-188 he then extended the mission to Belgium and Britain.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 17 He viewed it already as a way to leave Spain forever,For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 137 but at this stage things did not work out that way. He had to return to Barcelona; in 1914 the newly formed Mancomunitat launched a number of new educational establishments, but Bardina was not invited to take part in any.in 1914 Prat launched L‚ÄôInstitut d‚ÄôEstudis Catalans, la Biblioteca de Catalunya, Les Biblioteques Populars, La Universitat Industrial, La Instrucci√≥ Pedag√≤gica, but there is no mention of Bardina engaged in any of them, For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 79 He resumed collaboration with La Veu de Catalunya;it was terminated in 1910, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 162 under a pen- name \\"Capit√°n de Estado Mayor\\", in 1914-1917 he contributed fairly popular chronicles of military developments of the Great War.it seems that editor-in- chief of the daily was unaware of identity of his correspondent. The column was quite popular and at one point it drew attention of the military; the army requested to see the ‚Äúcaptain‚Äù; Bardina did not show up and from that moment onewards he used to sign as \\"C.E.M.\\", Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 189-190 In the 1910s he published also a few self-devised and hugely successful manuals on hygiene, medicine, self-defense, savoir-vivre and home cuisine.as \\"Dra.

He also dedicated himself to family life, enjoying birth and education of his 4 children. At unspecified time in the 1920s he commenced teaching at a customs officer training center, which proved to be a safe source of income and provided him with esteem of the civil servant.referred as ‚Äúescuela de Aduanas‚Äù, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 196 In the early 1920s Bardina and his local collaborator Joaqu√≠n Blaya launched Annuario Internacional Americano, a business magazine focused on commerce. The project proved hugely successful, with the review distributed in many American countries; it also consumed lots of his time, as gathering information and establishing new links Bardina started to travel across the continent; his trips took him to Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina and Ecuador. For the first time he enjoyed affluence, travelling extensively, staying in the best hotels and basking in the growing prestige.Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 196 As he maintained contacts with his former Barcelona editors, he kept re-issuing manuals written back in Spain; posing as an expert and hailed by friendly periodicals as ‚Äúcelebre Dr. Saimbraum‚Äù, one of the pen-names he assumed, Bardina used to recommend booklets of ‚ÄúDra. Fanny‚Äù, another nome de plume of him.La Hormiga de Oro 22.07.26, available here Valpara√≠so, former La Uni√≥n office Apart from contributing to periodicals issued by Seminario San Rafael, Bardina kept supplying other newspapers and reviews, like Diario Hispano-Americano of Valpara√≠so or Diario Ilustrado of Santiago de Chile; some, however, refused to publish his pieces due to ‚Äúexceso de originalidad‚Äù.El mundo espa√±ol, Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 193 His key partner remained La Uni√≥n, the assignment which originally brought him to Valpara√≠so; in fact, his contributions assumed massive scale. Bardina's flagship product was La Semana Internacional, a weekly Monday column discussing international politics which kept appearing until the early 1930s.the list in For√©s i Miravelles 1996, pp. 235-240 His pieces fell chiefly into three fields: education, international politics and internal social and political issues, the last one covered mostly from the Catholic social perspective.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 241; he was perceived as ‚Äúinfatigable difusor de la doctrina Social Cat√≥lica‚Äù, see comments on him in a Chilean periodical Lux in 1938, referred at estudiobardina website, available here It was his contributions to La Uni√≥n which over time earned Bardina the status of a pundit and high position in the Valpara√≠so societ√©. However, co-operation with the daily ended abruptly. In 1932 Bardina sided with the striking staff against the La Uni√≥n management; as a result he had to leave the newspaper.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 242 Scholar Escuela de Derecho (current view) In 1928 Bardina was appointed professor of labor law at Escuela de Derecho, a newly establishedcompare Agust√≠n Squella, Ricardo Loyola, Escuela de Derecho.

He retained jefatura of C√°tedra del Derecho de Trabajo throughout the 1930s and most of the 1940s, putting into practice his concepts of education. Bardina remained very distinct from other professors; he is remembered by his former disciples as attentive, encouraging, partner-like and sort of an ‚Äúiconoclast‚Äù. Instead of lecturing the audience, he preferred ‚Äì much in line with his educational outlook, though also perhaps not unrelated to his lack of juridical background ‚Äì to engage in discussion.Mario Alegr√≠a Alegr√≠a, Recuerdos de un almuno de Don Juan Bardina y Castara, [in:] Cr√≥nicas de Valpara√≠so, 12.04.05, available here Periodically he was entrusted also with other academic assignments, e.g. temporarily holding C√°tedra de Sociolog√≠a y Econom√≠a Social.Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 200 In 1932 Bardina set up another weekly on his own, La Semana Internacional. The periodical, very much a one-man show, kept appearing for some 15 years and was distributed in America and in Europe. It turned into his personal tribune; apart from review of international politics, it covered a vast array of other topics,For√©s i Miravelles 1996, pp. 246-7 earning him position also abroad.one of his readers in Europe was Agust√≠ Chalaux Le Semana demonstrated Bardina's increasingly democratic penchanthe has long abandoned earlier monarchism, turning not only a republican, but also supporter of universal suffrage, including the feminine vote, compare his comments on the Spanish republican constitution, La Semana Internacional 16.04.34, available here combined with concern about social issues and poverty. Initially sympathetic towards the Spanish Republic, he later started to view it as incapable of solving structural issues; following a period of hesitation, during the Civil War he tended to side with the Nationalists.Bardina viewed the Spanish Civil War as a social conflict, though his view was from orthodox. According to him, the Republicans offered unworkable recipes of false democracy, while the Nationalists sought a holistic solution; \\"El general Franco, en dos de sus discursos, ha esbozado un excelente programa de gobierno, cuya mitad ya quisi√©ramos ver realizado. Con ello bastar√≠a para salvar a Espa√±a\\", La Semana Internacional 24.10.36, available here Posing as an impartial observer, he welcomed Falange's program\\" la juventud falangista de Badajoz publicaba un programa que ver√° la luz en estas columnas.

Son rebrotes afrancesados cuya nacionalizaci√≥n no se ha realizado todav√≠a.

According to Bardina, Hitler was an icon of democracy as ‚Äúen ese movimiento liberador del pueblo alem√°n, a nombre de la democracia y autodeterminaci√≥n de los pueblos, Adolfo Hitler ha tenido papel tan descollante, que nadie estar√≠a en raz√≥n si no colocase a ese hombre en la cumbre de los que act√∫an en estos instantes‚Äù, La Semana Internacional 20.04.40, available here and their sidekicks like Poland.Poland was presented as imperialist country, with its raison d‚Äôetre oppressing other nations, which in 1939 fell victim to its own imperialism, La Semana Internacional 02.09.39, available here Politically he neared Movimiento Nacional-Socialista de Chile of Jorge Gonz√°lez von Mar√©es.William Thayer Arteaga, Humanismo cristiano chileno (1931-2001): sus inspiradores, sus seguidores, sus pol√©micas y luchas, Santiago de Chile 2002, , p. 135 Chilean fascists, 1940s The 1930s are perhaps the period of Bardina's professional and social climax. Holding a prestigious academic post, he enjoyed friendship with some highly positioned Chilean dignitaries, including the president of Chile, Carlos Iba√±ez del Campo; young people were turning to him when seeking jobs.Alegr√≠a Alegr√≠a 2005 He was offered newspaper management posts back in Spain,at the Carlist Barcelona daily, El Correo Catalan. Bardina neither accepted nor rejected; he commenced discussion on terms and conditions.

Due to its pro-Nazi sympathies, La Semana was blacklisted by the US authorities, which caused problems in print and in distribution;Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 200-201 the weekly went into decline. His manuals, reprinted for years in Spain, were already 20 years old and dried out as a source of royalties.the last one identified is La cocina casera (Barcelona 1941), compare antiquamarilda service, available here Though in 1945 Bardina was still noted as an energetic, elderly gentleman,Alegr√≠a Alegr√≠a 2005 his health soon deteriorated rapidly and he had to abandon the academic post.Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, p. 201 As a result, his last years were plagued by financial problems.Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 201-202 Thought primary education, Catalonia Bardina's views on education are reconstructed predominantly on basis of his theoretical works. His opus consists mostly of articles, scattered across numerous periodicals issued in Spain or in Chile.their number is not clear. Those referred in works dealing with Bardina do not exceed one hundred His manuals, published anonymously and few of them covering education-related topics, attracted far less attention. How Bardina put his ideas into practice remains rather obscure; the 1906-1910 period at Escola de Mestres is analyzed in detail,and not necessarily representative of his concept of education. Escola de Mestres was not designed as a model school; it was envisaged as a specific institution, supposed to provide cadres for the future education but there is no study of his term in the Santiago seminary in the late 1910, in the Valpara√≠so college in the 1920s, in Escuela de Derecho in the 1930s and 1940s or in fiscal and customs training schools in Chile. It is not completely clear how Bardina developed his interest in education and what his inspiration was. His ideas on the long term relationship between forming teachers and its socio-economic consequences are only reflected on his work. Some scholars assume that his first observations were a negative one, namely own 9-year period in the seminary.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 13 Having learnt the basicssome scholars claim that was aware of trends in education all over the world, For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 113, which is probably correct when applied to his Chilean period during university studies, he kept reading; personally he neared the Gines de los Rios brothers. Later on he admitted influence of Torres, Rey, Bol√≠var, Ortega, Bartolom√©, father Manj√≥n, Ribera and Altamira,For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 77 which adds up to an amalgamate of innovators encompassing Escuelas del Ave Mar√≠a, technocrats, Liberals and heterodoxes from Instituci√≥n Libre. Bardina rejected what he perceived as antiquated education system and strove to build a new one. Its objective was not to pass on knowledge, but to prepare for life within a system.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 111 The means was to reinvigorate and channel natural potential of students;For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 106 this in turn was to be achieved by focus on effort instead of result, on searching instead of absorbing, on satisfaction instead of awards/penalties and on co-operation instead of competition.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 106 The role of teachers was an apostolic one; to inspire and lead by example rather than to enforce and execute.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 106 School was to be a natural setting ‚Äì hence the stress on Catalan as native tongue,Jim√©nez Serradilla, p. 16 excursions, hygiene, physical exercises,detailed discussion in Xavier Torrebadella Flix, La aportaci√≥n bibliogr√°fica de Joan Bardina a la Educaci√≥n F√≠sica moderna (1911-1939), [in:] Cab√°s 9 (2013), pp. 1-22 experiments and interfacing with the non-scholarly realm in general;Jim√©nez Serradilla, p. 12 mixed-sex education and a social mixFor√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 180 were considered components of this natural realm.

Reception and legacy Catalonia, 1920s During the period of 1904-1909 Bardina seemed a rising star of the Catalan education system; afterwards he remained sidetracked, to disappear entirely in 1917. Some scholars claim that schooling initiatives of Mancomunitat, launched in the 1910s and 1920s, were influenced by the Bardinian vision,his heritage is influencing the Catalan educational thought of the era but also spirit of the institutions ran by Mancomsunitat: Patronat d'Escoles, Consell de Pedagogia, Quaderns d‚ÄôEstudi,and on his alumni, Jim√©nez Serradilla, p. 18 though they note also that he was merely one of many contributors to the ongoing change in education.apart from l‚ÄôEscola Sant Jordi of Flos i Calcat, L‚Äôescola Horaciana of Pau Vila, Integral of Alban Rossell and a number of Mancomunitat initiatives, Jim√©nez Serradilla, pp. 12-14 The most visible sign of Bardina's presence in Spain in the 1920s and 1930s were countlessLa cocina casera was issued by the publishing house Hymsa at least 7 times editions of his anonymous manuals.the last one identified was published in 1940 In the local Valpara√≠so realm he gained recognition as a press pundit; his academic role earned Bardina appreciation among the disciples, though he is not noted as an influential figure among Chilean scholars of law. It is rather his commentaries on international politics, especially on the American continent, which were acknowledged in Chile and some other Latin American countries. In 1944 he first earned a biography in Diccionario Biogr√°fico de Chile, to be dropped in subsequent editions published after his death.Martorell, Cassasses, Parunella 1959, pp. 2, 12 Upon the news of Bardina's demise, in 1951 his former disciples and alumniJoan Gibert Camins, Alexandre Gal√≠, Josep Agell, Ramon Sastre, Joan Llongueras, Miguel Fornaguera and others organized a homage in his native Sant Boi.For√©s i Miravelles 1996, p. 276 Soon afterwards three of them started to collect data for his brief biography, which was published in 1959;Artur Martorell, Enric Cassasses, Josep Parunella, Joan Bardina I Castar√°.

So far it remains unclear whether Bardina's textbooks on topics ranging from infantry tactics to grammar, self-defense, hygiene, savoir-vire and home-made confectionery are charlatanrya dilettante in many fields he wrote about, throughout all his life Bardina wrote as an expert; under a pen- name he wrote recommendations for another of his pen-names, and under this one to write prologues to works written also by himself, but under one more pen- name. At least some of his works contain entirely erroneous claims, compare his discussion on history of the Spanish national flag, written in 1936 for the Latin American audience, La Semana Internacional 24.10.36, available here or rather useful contributions to popular education.

Rodericus is known through a single ballade attributed to him in the Chantilly Codex as S Uciredor, which is \\"Rodericus\\" spelled backwards.Nors S. Josephson, \\"Rodericus\\". The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd edition, 2001. The piece, Angelorum Psalat, is in two voices and is an exemplary work of the Ars subtilior style, with many similarities to works of Jacob Senleches. Angelorum Psalat exhibits considerable rhythmic complexityNors S. Josephson, \\"Rodericus: Angelorum Psalat\\". Musica Disciplina 25 (1971), pp. 113‚Äì126 (includes transcription). and its text employs contrasting imagery of original sin and the harmony of the spheres, a common poetic device of the age.M.C. G√≥mez, \\"Some Precursors of the Spanish Lute School\\". Early Music 20 (1992), pp. 583‚Äì593, at p. 585. Nothing is known of Rodericus's life, although Gilbert Reaney suggested that he is Rodrigo de la Guitarra, since Rodrigo is the only known contemporaneous musician with the same name.Gilbert Reaney, \\"The Manuscript Chantilly, Musee Conde 1047\\". Musica Disciplina 8 (1954), pp. 78‚Äì79. However, this Rodrigo appears in Toledo as late as 1458, which would have made him extraordinarily long-lived, even assuming he composed maturely from a young age. No other supporting evidence had arisen since Reaney's conjecture.Young, p. 6, footnote 5. Crawford Young suggested in 2008 that Rodericus is the musician and clergyman Johannes Rogerii.Crawford Young, \\"Antiphon of the Angels: Angelorum psalat tripudium\\". Recercare 20, No. 1/2 (2008), pp. 5‚Äì23 (includes a new transcription). pp. 13‚Äì14 about the identity of Rodericus Young argues that the author of Angelorum Psalat must have been an extremely well developed composer and musician. Rogerii is a plausible candidate, since his terms of service in various courts closely tracked with those of composers whose style resembles that developed in Angelorum Psalat. He preceded Jacob Senleches at the cardinal's court in Aragon and was contemporaneous or nearly so with composers such as Hasprois and Guido de Lange at the court of Pope Benedict XIII. Guido makes use of the semiminima very similarly to Rodericus. Young's main argument is the veiled reference to Pope Innocent VII, who appears in the last word of the ballade as \\"Innocui\\" (innocent) with an otherwise unmotivated first initial letter. In other sections of the ballade there are other letters \\"i\\" as initials, or an \\"in\\" aside from the meter of the poem, indicating that this \\"in\\" is a wild beast corrupting the unity of the world, or the papal world, since pope Benedict, for whom Rogerii worked, felt himself to be the true pope: \\"in retro mordens ut fera pessima\\" (in ...: retreat! biting wild horrible beast).Crawford Young, p. 7, footnote 13 Rogerii also named himself \\"Vatignies\\", apparently after a little northern French community until today (Wattignies),Ursula G√ºnther, \\"Zur Biographie einiger Komponisten der Ars subtilior\\". Archiv f√ºr Musikwissenschaft 21 (1964), p. 188 footnote. in the close vicinity of either Senlecques or Salesches, where the composer Senleches may have come from. Senleches was the main reference point for the new signs for subtle note values used in \\"Angelorum psalat\\". In his later years, Rogerii was a distinguished member of the papal chapel, which he reentered in 1396 earning the commendation \\"omnes et singule exemptiones, immunitates, franchisie ac libertates capellanorum et familiarum\\" Ursula G√ºnther, p. 188 footnote.

History The church foundation is probably medieval, but the current building was built around 1761 as a private chapel for Holbrook Hall. It was consecrated for use as the parish church for the village in 1835. It was rebuilt in 1842 by W. Evans of Allstree. In further alteration in 1887 it was re-seated by Mr Thompson of Derby for Sir William Evans, 1st Baronet. It was re-opened on 1 December 1887 by the Bishop of Southwell. After a disastrous fire on 27 January 1907 caused by a defective flue it was rebuilt by Naylor and Sale of Derby. They took this opportunity to add a new south aisle, which increased the seating by 75. The church before the fire had no chancel, but this was remedied. Three arches span the old nave, leaving the sanctuary in the centre with new traceried east window, and on one side an entrance with new porch, the other being the organ chamber. The chancel was floored with marble and Hopton stone. Messrs Walker and Slater were the general contractors. The carving in the chancel was done by R. Bridgman of Lichfield, and the altar provided by Wippell and Co of London. The altar hangings were made by Hawes and Son of Norwich. It reopened on 15 April 1908. A further restoration was undertaken when the church was closed for a few weeks in 1929.

Biography  Traverse in an Anishinaabe, specifically Ojibwe, from Winnipeg, Manitoba. She spent her early years with her biological father living in Winnipeg, MB. Her father encouraged her early interest in art, buying her art supplies. Her early life was difficult growing up in Winnipeg's North End when her mother died at a young age and her siblings were apprehended in the Sixties Scoop. Traverse draws inspiration in her art and activism from her experience growing up as an indigenous woman in one of Winnipeg's toughest neighbourhoods. She studied at the School of Fine Arts at the University of Manitoba and graduated in 2009. Traverse is currently working out of Winnipeg, MB.  Artwork  Traverse is known for her acrylic/oil paintings and stop-motion animated films that feature indigenous women, the sacred feminine, motherhood, urban indigenous lifestyle and traditional native american spiritual themes, including the seven traditional teachings of the Anishinaabe. She has also created artwork for schools in Winnipeg to inspire and educate youth on indigenous culture and traditions. Traverse has displayed her paintings at The Wah-Sa Gallery and The Winnipeg Art Gallery in Winnipeg, MB. In 2009, Coca-Cola announced the Aboriginal Art Bottle Program as part of a mission to showcase indigenous art at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Out of hundreds of submissions from professional and amateur indigenous artists from across Canada, fifteen sculptures were selected to be showcased across Canada and in Vancouver during the 2010 Winter Olympics. Jackie Traverse's submission was selected and displayed across Canada and in Vancouver during the Olympics.

It is the largest inland port in Saudi Arabia. The port is located on off Exit 16 in Al Malaz, adjacent to the Riyadh railway station. Riyadh Dry Port covers an area of 918,639 m2 and accommodates six 6,480 m2 warehouses. The port handled 250,000 TEU in 2003, and 500,000 TEU in 2013, recording an 18% growth from 2012. Riyadh Dry Port handled 26,000 TEU in May 2013, and 30,749 TEU in May 2014. On 5 June 2014, handled a record 987 containers in a single day.  History  Riyadh Dry Port was established in 1982. The port was initially operated by the Saudi Railways Organization (SRO), which also operates the cargo line and manages empty container yards in Dammam. SRO later decided to privatize the port's operations. BAAS International Group (BIG) won a 10-year contract to handle operations at Riyadh Dry Port in 2011. In May 2012, Musaid Al-Sayyari, the Head of the National Committee for Customs Clearance (NCCC) at the Council of Saudi Chambers of Commerce and Industry, stated that \\"poor operation of the dry port [had] caused enormous damage to the goods\\". Customs brokers filed complaints with the SRO regarding BIG's port operations, after the clearance of 7,000 goods faced disruptions over a 45-day period. On 3 April 2013, Navis announced that it had completed the deployment of the Navis SPARCS N4 terminal operating system (TOS) at the port. The port also installed SAP enterprise application software making Riyadh the fifth port in the world to run a combination of the SPARCS N4 V2.2, XPS and ECN4 NAVIS modules. In December 2016, customs authorities discovered nearly 5 kg of hashish hidden inside a consignment at the port.

Previously described as Avicularia avicularia variegata, it is synonymous with Avicularia bicegoi. When sold as pets, various English names have been associated with the scientific names of this species. As A. avicularia variegata, it has been called the grizzled pinktoe. As A. bicegoi, English names often refer to the red hairs on the abdomen of one colour form ‚Äì Manaus brick-red rump tree spider, brick red pink toe. Taxonomy In 1896, Frederick O. Pickard-Cambridge described spiders he had observed during an expedition to the Amazon basin as the subspecies variegata of the species Avicularia avicularia. He based the distinction on variations in colour, particularly of the leg hairs (setae), considering them insufficient to justify separation into two species. In 2017, Caroline Fukushima and Rog√©rio Bertani made a detailed study of the genus and concluded that there were other differences that did justify specific status. Avicularia variegata has legs I and IV of more-or-less the same length, Avicularia avicularia has the fourth leg more than 10% longer than the first leg, and in the female the spermathecae of A. variegata are wider in the middle whereas those of A. avicularia are as wide in the middle as at the base. In 1923, C√¢ndido Firmino de Mello-Leit√£o described Avicularia bicegoi. Fukushima and Bertani considered this to be the same species as A. variegata.

The lease shares a boundary with Shaw Station. The property was established at some time prior to 1907 and was regarded as one of the smaller leases in the area. It was producing wool for export in 1908, and was stocked with a flock of 5,300 sheep in 1912. In 1913 the lease was held by Archie McGregor and Percy Charles Riches. The station occupied an area of and was not yet completely fenced. The flock was 10,000 sheep but it was estimated that the area could support 17,000. The owners were also breeding donkeys and mules which they thought would be useful for general station work and well repairing work.

He reached the rank of major-general. Early life He was the second son of Major- general Sir Henry Torrens and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Robert Patton, governor of St. Helena, born on 18 August 1809; he was a godson of the Duke of Wellington. In 1819 he was appointed a page of honour to the Prince Regent. Torrens passed through the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and obtained a commission as ensign in the Grenadier Guards, becoming lieutenant on 14 April 1825. He was appointed adjutant of the second battalion with the temporary rank of captain on 11 June 1829. He was promoted captain on 12 June 1830. He continued to serve as adjutant of his battalion until 1838, when he was appointed brigade-major at Quebec on the staff of Major-general Sir James Macdonell, commanding a brigade in Canada. He took part in the operations against the Lower Canada Rebellion at the close of that year. He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 11 September 1840, when he returned to England. Royal Welch Fusiliers Torrens exchanged into the 23rd Royal Welch Fusiliers, and obtained its command on 15 October 1841. On the expansion of the army in April 1842 a second battalion was given to the regiment. The depot was moved from Carlisle to Chichester, where, with two new companies, it was organised for foreign service under Torrens, who embarked with it at Portsmouth for Canada on 13 May, arriving at Montreal on 30 June. In September 1843 Torrens went, in command of the first battalion, from Quebec to the West Indies, arriving at Barbados in October 1843. The battalion was moved from one island to another, but for two years and a half Torrens commanded the troops in Saint Lucia and administered the civil government of the island. The sanitary measures adopted by Torrens for the preservation of the health of the troops were considered exemplary, and correspondence on the subject was published in November 1847 by order of the Duke of Wellington, as commander- in-chief. Torrens declined the offer of the lieutenant-governorship of Saint Lucia as a permanent appointment. He sailed with his battalion from Barbados in March 1847, arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia in the following month. The battalion returned to England in September 1848, and was stationed at Winchester, where, on 12 July 1849, Prince Albert presented it with new colours. In April 1850 Torrens moved with the battalion to Plymouth, and the following year relinquished the command. On 1 January 1853 he was appointed an assistant quartermaster-general at the Horse Guards, and became a member of a commission researching the military of France, Austria, and Prussia. Crimean War Memorial to Maj. Gen. Torrens by Carlo Marochetti at the St. Paul's Cathedral In the Crimean War, Torrens was nominated a brigadier-general to command an infantry brigade. He joined the 4th Infantry Division under Sir George Cathcart at Varna, just before its embarkation. He was at the head of his brigade both at the Battle of Alma and at the Battle of Balaklava, where he was engaged in support of the cavalry and lost some men in recapturing two redoubts. On the morning of 5 November 1854, at the Battle of Inkermann, under the direction of Cathcart, he attacked the left flank of the Russian forces, his horse falling under him, pierced by five bullets, and was praised by Cathcart just before his mortal wound. He was struck by a bullet that passed through his body, injured a lung, splintered a rib, and was found lodged in his greatcoat. Torrens was invalided home. He received the Crimea medal and clasp, the thanks of Parliament, was promoted to be a major-general for distinguished service in the field on 12 December 1854, and was made a knight commander of the Bath, military division. Death On 2 April 1855 Torrens was appointed deputy quartermaster-general at headquarters, and on 25 June the same year was sent as a major-general on the staff to Paris as British military commissioner; but his health broke down, and he died in Paris on 24 August 1855. He was buried in the cemetery of P√®re-Lachaise. Works Torrens published Notes on French Infantry and Memoranda on the Review of the Army in Paris at the Feast of Eagles in May 1852 (London, 1852). Family Torrens married in 1832 Maria Jane, youngest daughter of General Sir John Murray, 8th Baronet.

He launched the magazine upon his return to Italy from exile in Moscow. He also edited the magazine until his death in 1964. Rinascita, published on a monthly basis, was headquartered in Rome. It was an official organ of the Italian Communist Party (PCI). Rinascita was established to serve as an ideological guide for militants and to revive the Marxist movement. The magazine described the party as the one, which had the most comprehensive vision of the nation's interests. It attempted to make a connection between Gramsci and Stalin. From 1962 the magazine was published weekly. At the end of the 1980s Rinascita temporarily stopped publication due to low circulation figures.

Life The son of a vintner in Greyfriars, London, who was admitted to St. Paul's School, he was sent to Cadiz while still young, to be trained in commerce. He was captured on his return voyage by a Sallee rover, and enslaved in Morocco. After three years' captivity Lucas went to Gibraltar. Edward Cornwallis, Gibraltar's governor, sent him back to Morocco as a vice-consul. He spent 16 years there. In 1785 Lucas returned to England, and was appointed oriental interpreter at court. He undertook a journey in Africa for the Association for Promoting African Exploration, set up in 1788. He left England in August 1788 with the intention of crossing the desert from Tripoli to Fezzan, in what is now Libya. The plan was to collect information in Fezzan, and from traders, on the interior, and to return home by way of The Gambia or the Guinea coast. At the end of October 1788, Lucas landed at Tripoli, and was received by Ali I Pasha. A revolt on the intended route delayed his journey, but two sharifs offered him safe conduct. Lucas started off on a mule, in an armed company with 18 others persons, in February 1789. They reached the ruins of Lebida, and then within a week \\"Menrata\\" (apparently Mesurata, i.e. Misrata). Adverse conditions meant the journey planned by Lucas had to be scaled back. He obtained information from one of the sharifs, who had travelled as factor in the slave-trade for the king of Fezzan, by trading a copy of a map of Africa for accounts of Fezzan, the Bornou empire, and Nigritia. Lucas turned back ar Memoon on 20 March 1789, reaching Tripoli on 6 April, and England on 26 July. He was succeeded in his African Association position by Daniel Houghton, and became consul in Tripoli in 1793. Works Lucas's account of Africa was published in the Reports of the African Association.

Personal life and education  Born on 21 May 1946 in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen, Utzon spent her childhood in Helleb√¶k, Denmark. When she was 15, she moved with her family to Australia where her father, architect J√∏rn Utzon, was to embark on the construction of the Sydney Opera House. After attending classes in painting and sculpture at East Sydney Technical College in Sydney, Australia (1967‚Äì1969), she studied textile arts at Copenhagen's School of Arts and Crafts (1967‚Äì1970). When she was 19, after disputes over the opera house, she and her family left Australia at short notice in April 1966. Back in Denmark, she married the architect Alex Popov who had worked with her father in Australia. The couple had two children in the early 1970s, Naja and Mika. After an early divorce, the children mainly lived with Utzon in her Danish home. Artistic work San Jose Convention Center Utzon's early creations included brightly coloured textiles for Bagsv√¶rd Church (1975‚Äì1977). In the mid-1980s, she spent three years decorating the new Volvo headquarters in G√∂teborg, Sweden, with a 36-metre wall and a 16-metre tapestry. In 1988, she completed a large red, white and black mural at the San Jose Convention Center resembling a flock of birds in flight. She has since decorated walls in the library of the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural College in Frederiksberg, and has added ceramic reliefs to the Finger B extension of Copenhagen Airport. Her creations have also included costumes and scenery for the Royal Danish Ballet. Since the early 1990s, Utzon has been married to the blind French writer Hugues de Montalembert.

It is a generalisation of the parallelogram law which in turn can be seen as generalisation of the Pythagorean theorem. Because of the latter the restatement of the Pythagorean theorem in terms of quadrilaterals is occasionally called the Euler‚ÄìPythagoras theorem.  Theorem and special cases  For a convex quadrilateral with sides a, b, c, d, diagonals e and f, and g being the line segment connecting the midpoints of the two diagonals, the following equations holds: :a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2=e^2+f^2+4g^2 If the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then the midpoints of the diagonals coincide so that the connecting line segment g has length 0. In addition the parallel sides are of equal length, hence Euler's theorem reduces to :2a^2+2b^2=e^2+f^2 which is the parallelogram law. If the quadrilateral is rectangle, then equation simplifies further since now the two diagonals are of equal length as well: :2a^2+2b^2=2e^2 Dividing by 2 yields the Euler‚ÄìPythagoras theorem: :a^2+b^2=e^2 In other words, in the case of a rectangle the relation of the quadrilateral's sides and its diagonals is described by the Pythagorean theorem.Lokenath Debnath: The Legacy of Leonhard Euler: A Tricentennial Tribute. World Scientific, 2010, , pp. 105‚Äì107  Alternative formulation and extensions  Euler's theorem with parallelogram Euler originally derived the theorem above as corollary from slightly different theorem that requires the introduction of an additional point, but provides more structural insight. For a given convex quadrilateral ABCD Euler introduced an additional point E such that ABED forms a parallelogram and then the following equality holds: :AB^2+BC^2+CD^2+AD^2=AC^2+BD^2+CE^2 The distance CE between the additional point E and the point C of the quadrilateral not being part of the parallelogram can be thought of measuring how much the quadrilateral deviates from a parallelogram and CE^2 is correction term that needs to be added to the original equation of the parallelogram law.Deanna Haunsperger, Stephen Kennedy: The Edge of the Universe: Celebrating Ten Years of Math Horizons. MAA, 2006, , pp. 137‚Äì139 M being the midpoint of AC yields tfrac{AC}{AM}=2. Since N is the midpoint of BD it is also the midpoint of AE, as AE and BD are both diagonals of the parallelogram ABED. This yields tfrac{AE}{AN}=2 and hence tfrac{AC}{AM}=tfrac{AE}{AN}. Therefore, it follows from the intercept theorem (and its converse) that CE and NM are parallel and CE^2=(2NM)^2=4NM^2, which yields Euler's theorem. Euler's theorem can be extended to a larger set of quadrilaterals, that includes crossed and nonplaner ones. It holds for so called generalized quadrilaterals, which simply consist of four arbitrary points in mathbb{R}^n connected by edges so that they form a cycle graph.Geoffrey A.

He was formerly the leader of a parody political party Sarmu probo nisi (SPN) formed in Mladenovac in 2016. His party participated in the 2016 local council election in the municipality of Mladenovac, winning 20 percent of the votes and 12 seats. He participated in the 2017 Serbian presidential election under his Preletaƒçeviƒá persona, finishing third with 9.44% of the votes. In 2018, Maksimoviƒá left the \\"party\\". Name The surname \\"Preletaƒçeviƒá\\" is a humorous pun. The word preletaƒç (similar to \\"defector\\") is used in Serbian language for a politician who switches political parties for personal gains. The nickname \\"Beli\\" means \\"The white\\" in Serbian. Biography Maksimoviƒá was born in 1991 in Velika Ivanƒça, Mladenovac. He is a communicology student. =2016 local election= Sarmu probo nisi (SPN) started as a fictional political party created by a group of comedians from Mladenovac. They became popular after they filmed a humorous parody promotional video for their fictional leader \\"Ljubi≈°a Preletaƒçeviƒá Beli\\". After the video became popular on YouTube, they were persuaded by their followers to participate in the election. The group vowed to make a lot of false promises and false hope. The focal point of their campaign was the promise to open a euthanasia department for pensioners in the local hospital in order to spare the country of their expenses. Local council elections were held in the most municipalities and cities in Serbia on 24 April 2016, together with the 2016 parliamentary election. Maksimoviƒá and his followers formed a parody political party called Sarmu probo nisi (SPN) and participated in the local election in the Municipality of Mladenovac. Because SPN is not officially registered as political party, they participated as an independent list called \\"Beli - Samo jako\\" (Beli - Go hard!). This list surprisingly won 20% of the votes and 12 seats, becoming the second strongest group in the local council of Mladenovac, behind only the ruling Serbian Progressive Party. =2017 presidential election= Maksimoviƒá launched his campaign for the 2017 Serbian presidential election on 4 March 2017. He campaigns under his Preletaƒçeviƒá persona with the political slogan \\"Samo jako!\\" (Go hard!). Sa≈°a Raduloviƒá, one of the Serbian parliamentary opposition leaders, supported his campaign, saying that his candidacy will contribute to the raise of the turnout in the first round of the elections, thus preventing the Prime Minister and ruling party presidential candidate Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá from achieving more than 50 percent of the votes, and forcing the runoff; Maksimoviƒá also said that this is one of his main reasons for the candidacy. On 11 March 2017, Maksimoviƒá announced that he collected 10,000 signatures of support needed for candidacy. On 13 March, national Electoral Commission officially declared his candidacy for the presidency. Despite running as a joke candidate, he finished the election in the third place, winning 326,055 or 9.44% of the votes cast.  Platform  The Beli platform was entirely humorous and tongue-in-cheek. Some prominent campaign promises included building a Serbian coastline and constructing hills in Pancevo so that residents could sled in the wintertime. He would tell voters that he would offer \\"three times as much\\" as the other candidates. He noted that he supported universal employment, increased pensions for all people, and endorsed \\"uniting\\" the Balkans to become a superpower. =2018 local election= In early 2018, Maksimoviƒá announced that he will participate at the March 2018 local election for the Assembly of the City of Belgrade with new group of supporter, leaving Sarmu probo nisi (a.k.a. \\"Beli - samo jako\\" movement). Subsequently, the movement dissociated itself from Maksimoviƒá. At the March 2018 local election, Maskimoviƒá participated with an electoral list named \\"Ljubi≈°a Preletaƒçeviƒá Beli - Zato ≈°to volimo Belovgrad\\". Electoral commission refused to approve his list without permission from a person whose name is used (although there was no person with that name at that moment). After that, it was reported that that same day Maksimoviƒá's cousin Ognjen Maksimoviƒá legally changed his name to \\"Ljubi≈°a Preletaƒçeviƒá Beli\\" and gave written permission for his name to be used on the electoral list. After that, electoral commission approved the list. Some political commentators and opponents criticized this unusually quick name changing procedure and accused Maksimoviƒá for secretly working for the ruling party. Luka Maksimoviƒá dismissed those accusations and said that his cousin already filed a request for name change two weeks earlier.

He started his career playing as a flanker, but switched to the front row midway through his career and from then on played predominantly at hooker. Career =Beginnings= Norman learned his rugby at Medway Street School and was a school-boy international in 1911 captaining England to their first win over Wales. Norman served in the First World War with the Royal Artillery in Mesopotamia. =Leicester= Norman made his Leicester debut on 17 January 1920 at Welford Road against Headingley playing at flanker and scoring 3 conversions in a 54-11 win for Leicester. Norman featured a further eight times for the Tigers in the 1919/20 season scoring tries in away wins against Cardiff and Gloucester. Norman was then on a regular in the first team's back row starting over 30 games in six of next seven seasons. For the 1927/28 season Norman switched to the front row where he spent the second half of his career. Predominantly a hooker he also played games as a prop. Norman's finest achievement was captaining Leicestershire and the East Midlands to victory over the touring South Africans the Springbokson 14 November 1931, the only defeat the side suffered on their tour. That performance earned him an England Test debut against the same opposition on 2 January 1932 at Twickenham. He also played two weeks later against Wales at St. Helen's in Swansea. England however lost both and Norman did not represent his country again. =Final season and retirement= The 1932/33 season was Norman's last and for it he was appointed as Leicester's captain. Unfortunately he was injured in the second game of the season against Old Blues, where he was substituted for the only time, and missed the next seven games. He returned to the side in October against Gloucester and played 24 games that the season. His final match for the Tigers was an 8-15 loss on Tuesday 18 April 1933 against Bath at The Recreation Ground. Norman's 453 games place him fourth all time for most appearances, against Bath in on 5 September 1931 he became only the second player to play 400 games for the club. During the Second World War he was a member of the home guard and organised the Leicester Harlequins side, which became the base for the re-formed Tigers in 1945. He was president of Leicester Tigers between 1965 and 1968.

On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received a score of 78. Fred Thomas of AllMusic gave the album four out of five stars, remarking it \\"Time to Go Home takes the band's unique blend of beauty and absurdity into slightly different places.\\" A mixed review came from Devon Fisher of PopMatters, who said the album \\"sounds more like it came out of the ‚Äò90s than any of Sub Pop‚Äôs still-active groups that were putting out records back then.\\" He also felt it \\"seems like half the album it could have been.\\" Bryn Lovitt of Spin gave the album eight out of ten stars and wrote, \\"Time to Go Home is a throwback to mid-‚Äô80s darkwave that gives it an intellectual edge for its resemblance to such a specific moment in classic British new wave.\\" Track listing All tracks written by Julia Shapiro, except \\"Lydia\\" written by Lydia Lund.

Chave Collisson, was an activist in Australia and Great Britain for several feminist causes. History Collisson was born in America the elder daughter of Rev. Reginald Kingsmill Collisson (1857 ‚Äì 5 August 1932) and his Irish-born wife Katherine (or Catherine) Elizabeth Collisson, n√©e Gamble (1862 ‚Äì 28 December 1944). The Rev. R. K. Collisson was born in London; his father was an Anglican clergyman, as were his three brothers. He served the Church in England for ten years; four years in America; the remainder of his 51 years' service was spent in Tasmania and South Australia. His last and longest charge was the Church of the Epiphany, Crafers, where many of Adelaide's leading lights were married. Their other daughter Nora Winifred Collisson (died 1963) was headmistress of Lowther Hall Church of England Grammar School for Girls, and author of The Warrior and a play To the Day. Chave Collisson was educated at home, the Collegiate School, Hobart, and Sydney University, where she was elected one of the first directors of the newly founded Women's Club and the first secretary of University of Sydney Women's Union. She spent a year on the staff of the University as Assistant to the Director of Tutorial Classes and Lecturer in History. She was active in the Workers' Educational Association and a proponent of further education for women, so they could take a leading place as workers and citizens. In 1919 Collisson earned her MA from Columbia University in New York. During The Great War she was an effective organiser for the Red Cross Society among university students. She strongly supported the push for conscription, often appearing on the same platform as the NSW Premier, W. A.

It is the sequel to Fire and Forget, which was developed by Titus France SA for a number of platforms including the ZX Spectrum. Fire & Forget II is one of a number of similar games which emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the wake of Sega's popular arcade driving game Out Run (1986). It is notable for the variety of its enemy sprites, and for its use of parallax scrolling. It is also notable for being one of the first video games to be launched simultaneously on two consoles.Mean Machines, Issue 2, November 1990  Gameplay  The object of the game is to prevent a convoy of vehicles from reaching the city of Megapolis where a terrorist attack has been planned against the 3rd International Conference for Peace.Sega, Fire & Forget II Instruction manual, pp.4-6 Taking control of a weaponised flying car named the Thunder Master II in pursuit of this goal, the player is presented with a combination of racing, flying and shoot 'em up gameplay elements.

Life Born in Edinburgh on 17 May 1736, he was the son of Alexander Lind of Gorgie, and nephew of George Lind the Edinburgh Member of Parliament, the sons of George Lind of Gorgie. He was the first cousin of James Lind (1716‚Äì1794) the naval physician, whose father James Lind was the brother of George Lind of Gorgie. He was also first cousin to James Keir.Barbara M. D.

His mother Helen was daughter of George Allardice, Member of Parliament. He studied Medicine at Edinburgh University and graduated in 1765. In 1766, he then joined the East India Company as surgeon and sailed to China. In 1768 he received his doctorate (MD). On 6 November 1770 he was admitted a Fellow of the College of Physicians, Edinburgh. Lind accompanied Joseph Banks on his voyage to Iceland, the expedition setting sail 12 July 1772. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London 18 December 1777. Around the same time he seems to have settled at Windsor, where he later became physician to the royal household. When the coffin of Edward IV was opened and examined at Windsor in 1789, he made an analysis of the liquid found in it. He kept up a correspondence with Banks, and with Tiberio Cavallo.Christopher Goulding, The Real Professor Frankenstein?, J. R. Med. Soc. 2002; 95, 257‚Äì259, at p. 258 (PDF) He corresponded with Patrick Wilson about William Herschel's work.Christopher Goulding, Shelley's Cosmological Sublime: William Herschel, James Lind and \\"The Multitudinous Orb\\", The Review of English Studies New Series, Vol. 57, No. 232 (Nov. 2006), pp. 783‚Äì792, at p. 788. Published by: Oxford University Press. Charles Burney described Lind as extremely thin, and in her Diary Fanny Burney mentioned his wife as \\"about six times as big\\". She also cast doubt whether he obtained much of a private practice: \\"people were afraid of his trying experiments with their constitutions, and thought him a better conjuror than a physician\\". Lind died at the house of his son-in-law, William Burnie, in Russell Square, London, on 17 October 1812. Freemasonry Lind was a Scottish Freemason. He was Initiated in Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No. 2, on 2 August 1758.

By Alan MacKenzie. 1888. P.242. In literature Lind was alluded to by Percy Bysshe Shelley in two poems from 1817, the old man who rescues Laon in The Revolt of Islam, and Prince Athanase, where he appears as the magus Zonoras. Shelley, in his final two years at Eton College, had Lind as a mentor, around 1809. He is also thought to be the source for the character of the blind old man De Lacey and galvanism in the novel Frankenstein, as applied by the eponymous Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Works Lind's inaugural dissertation, De Febre Remittente Putrida Paludum qu√¶ grassabatur in Bengalia A.D. 1762, was published at Edinburgh in 1768. In 1772 he produced a translation, Treatise on the Fever of 1762 at Bengal. In three papers for the Royal Society, Lind discussed: the 1769 transit of Venus observed at Hawkhill, near Edinburgh; an eclipse of the moon, same place and year, with remarks by Nevil Maskelyne; and in 1775 a portable wind gauge. He gave Thomas Pennant a map of Islay, and a measurement of its longitude. At his private press at Windsor, Lind printed The Genealogy of the Families of Lind and the Montgomeries of Smithson, by Sir Robert Douglas, 6th Baronet. He produced pamphlets, and experimented with typography. Family Lind's wife was Ann Elizabeth Mealy. Their daughter Dorothy Sophia Banks Lind married Isaac Gosset (1782‚Äì1855); and was mother of Helen Dorothea or Dorothy Gosset, who married William Driscoll Gosset. Their daughter Anne Lind married William Burnie in 1806. There was a third daughter, Lucy Maria, and a son Alexander. Lucy, the eldest, married Markham Eeles Sherwill, and they had three sons (Markham Eeles, Walter Stanhope and James) and five daughters (Ariana Maria, Julia Sophia, Lucy Maria, Anne Elizabeth and Helen Matilda).

United States, 541 U.S. 176 (2004), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court decided sand and gravel are not \\"valuable minerals\\" reserved to the United States Government under the Pittman Underground Water Act of 1919. The Court sided in a 6‚Äì3 decision with the petitioner, BedRoc Limited, and reversed the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court. BedRoc Limited had removed sand and gravel from lands obtained under the Pittman Act, and the United States, the respondent, argued those were reserved to the U.S. Government under that law. William Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, that relied on a textualist approach, and was joined by three justices. He argued sand and gravel were not considered \\"valuable minerals\\" in Nevada when the Pittman Act was passed in 1919. A concurring opinion was written by Clarence Thomas, and joined by another justice. Two justices joined John P. Stevens' dissenting opinion, that relied on legislative history and a previous decision of the Supreme Court.  Background  In 1940, Newton and Mabel Butler patented of land under the Pittman Underground Water Act (). The land was situated in Lincoln County, Nevada, north of Las Vegas. A tenant started extracting sand and gravel in the early 1990s. The land was sold to Earl Williams in 1993, and he continued to remove sand and gravel from the land. That same year, Williams received two trespass notices from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), that argued he was removing mineral materials from public lands. Williams challenged the notices, but the BLM ruled that the government held a reservation to the \\"valuable minerals\\" on the land.. In 1995, BedRoc Limited, LLC bought the land, and continued to remove sand and gravel under an interim agreement with the Department of the Interior. Under the agreement, BedRoc Limited had to place money in escrow from the sale of each cubic yard of sand and gravel that the company removed, pending a final resolution. A year later, BedRoc Limited transferred of the land to Western Elite, Inc. The Interior Board of Land Appeals upheld the decision by the BLM in 1997, relying on the legislative history of the Pittman Act and on Congress' intent. Subsequently, BedRoc Limited filed an action to quiet title in the United States District Court of Nevada. BedRoc Limited demanded ownership of the sand and gravel, while the American government asked for trespass damages. On May 24, 1999, Justice Philip Martin Pro of the Court decided that sand and gravel were \\"valuable minerals\\" reserved to the American government under the Pittman Act. The Court asked itself whether sand and gravel were minerals, whether they were valuable, and whether the \\"nonmineral\\" certification of the Pittman Act had any influence. The Court argued sand and gravel were minerals, and decided they were valuable under the Pittman Act based on Congress' intent and on debates. Besides, the Court argued lands containing minerals could be classified as nonmineral. BedRoc Limited appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court, and Western Elite was added as a plaintiff. The three-judge panel consisting of Judges Michael Daly Hawkins, Susan P. Graber, and Richard C. Tallman argued on November 7, 2002, and affirmed the decision by the District Court. The opinion was written by Graber. After concluding the language of the Pittman Act itself was ambiguous, the Court deserted to the purpose of the law and to the legislative history. The Ninth Circuit Court decided sand and gravel were \\"valuable minerals\\" reserved to the United States, because there was a market for sand and gravel when the Pittman Act was enacted, and because Congress intended the reservation of the Pittman Act to be the same as the mineral reservation of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act. The Court said \\"the mineral reservation [was] to be read broadly in the light of the agricultural purpose [of the law]\\". BedRoc argued a site-specific analysis had to be used to determine whether sand and gravel were valuable, but the Court disagreed. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on September 30, 2003, and the oral argument occurred on January 20 of the following year. During the argument, BedRoc Limited was represented by R. Timothy McCrum, while the United States Government was represented by Thomas L. Sansonetti. All justices asked questions or made remarks except for Clarence Thomas.  Legal background  The patent to the land was granted under the Pittman Underground Water Act, that went into effect in 1919. Under that law, the Secretary of the Interior could grant patents to people who established a water supply. It only applied to Nevada. The eighth section of the Pittman Act stated that each patent contained \\"a reservation to the United States of all the coal and other valuable minerals in the lands\\" and the right for the government to \\"prospect for, mine and remove the same\\" under the laws in force during a disposal of the minerals.BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 179. The Supreme Court cited Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc., a 1983 Supreme Court decision, in which the Court interpreted the mineral reservation of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act (SRHA), that was enacted in 1916. The Supreme Court decided gravel was a mineral reserved to the government under the SRHA. The Court looked at whether gravel was part of the surface estate, which belongs to the patentee, or to the mineral estate, which belongs to the government. It decided substances are reserved to the government when they are mineral in character, can be removed from the soil, can be used for commercial purposes, and when there is no reason for the substance to be included in the surface estate. The mineral reservation of the SRHA differs from the one of the Pittman Act, as the SRHA does not include the word \\"valuable\\".BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 181.  Opinion of the court  The Court decided on March 31, 2004, and delivered three opinions. The majority opinion was supported by four justices, the concurring opinion by two, and the dissenting opinion by three. The majority argued sand and gravel were not valuable when the law was passed in 1919 according to common sense, while the dissenting opinion said the emphasis on the word \\"valuable\\" was unjust, and said it was Congress' intent to include sand and gravel in the reservation. The concurring opinion acknowledged the emphasis on valuable was unjust, while saying the word \\"mineral\\" itself includes the requirement of commercial purpose as was decided in Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc. = Majority opinion = Chief Justice William Rehnquist The majority opinion was written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, and Anthony Kennedy. Adopting a textualist approach, the majority held that sand and gravel were not \\"valuable minerals\\" reserved to the government. The Court said it would not extend its decision in Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc. to say that sand and gravel are valuable minerals. According to the majority, the Court had to focus on the meaning of the law when it was enacted, and it asked itself \\"whether the sand and gravel found in Nevada were commonly regarded as \\"valuable minerals\\" in 1919\\". According to the majority, common sense said no, as sand and gravel were abundant, had no intrinsic value, and were commercially worthless in Nevada in 1919. The Court said sand and gravel could not be mistaken for \\"valuable minerals\\" no matter if they would be regarded as minerals.BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 177. Furthermore, the Pittman Underground Water Act stated the disposal had to happen \\"in accordance with the provisions of the coal and mineral land laws in force at the time of such disposal\\". The Court said Congress was referring to the General Mining Act of 1872, that stated \\"all valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the United States\\" were \\"free and open to exploration and purchase\\". The majority said it was undeniable that \\"common sand and gravel could not constitute a locatable \\"valuable mineral deposit\\" under the General Mining Act\\".BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 186. The majority did not consider the legislative history as it did in Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc., as the Pittman Act explicitly used the word \\"valuable\\" in contrast to the Stock-Raising Homestead Act (SRHA). Because of the absence of the word \\"valuable\\" in the SRHA, the Court had to speculate about Congress' intent in Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc. Furthermore, by deciding in favor of the plaintiff, the Court left its principle that \\"land grants are construed favorably to the Government... and if there are doubts they are reserved for the Government, not against it\\", which it called an \\"established rule\\" in Wat v. Western Nuclear, Inc. Justice Clarence Thomas = Concurring opinion = Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion, that was joined by Justice Stephen Breyer.BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 187-89 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment). Thomas agreed with the dissenting opinion that no distinction could be made between the mineral reservation in the Pittman Underground Water Act and in the Stock-Raising Homestead Act (SRHA). He, however, argued that sand and gravel are not part of the mineral reservations of both laws, disagreeing with Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc. Thomas argued the emphasis the majority lays on the word \\"valuable\\" was unjust, as the Pittman Act uses \\"valuable minerals\\" and \\"minerals\\" interchangeably. Thomas said both phrases therefore were meant as synonymous. Moreover, Thomas said if \\"valuable\\" was the source of the requirement that the minerals should have commercial worth, that would be inconsistent with Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc., because that decision said that a substance was a mineral when it could be used for commercial purposes. Thomas, in his opinion, disagreed with the conclusion of Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc. He did not agree that sand and gravel are minerals under the SRHA only because, hypothetically, \\"they could have been used for commercial purposes,\\" when the SRHA was passed. Thomas agreed with the majority opinion that according to common sense and the statutory context sand and gravel could not be used for commercial purposes, when the Pittman Act was passed in 1919. Thomas wrote in his opinion that he did not advocate overruling Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc. despite disagreeing with the decision.BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 189 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment). = Dissenting opinion = John P. Stevens Justice John P. Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion, that was joined by Justices David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 190-92 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Stevens said the majority opinion depended entirely on the word \\"valuable\\", and he rejected this emphasis. He said the reservation of the Pittman Underground Water Act was meant to be the same as that of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act (SRHA).BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 191-92 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Stevens called it highly unlikely that Congress meant to make a distinction between the reservation of the Pittman Act and the one of the SRHA, as it would be illogical that Congress would have wanted a reservation to the sand and gravel in lands covered by the SRHA, but not to the sand and gravel in lands covered by the Pittman Act. Besides, Stevens referred to a House Committee Report which said section 8 of the Pittman Act contained the same reservation of minerals as the SRHA. Stevens criticized the majority opinion for ignoring the fact that Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc. already stated that a substance must be valuable to be a mineral. Moreover, he said \\"valuable minerals\\" and \\"minerals\\" were meant to be synonymous, as the Pittman Act contains the phrase \\"valuable minerals\\" twice and the words \\"minerals\\" and \\"mineral\\" without the word \\"valuable\\" eight times. Stevens did not rule out the possibility that the majority opinion in Watt v. Western Nuclear, Inc. misinterpreted Congress' intention, but he said there was no reason to choose another assessment of the Congress' intention over the old one. Stevens criticized the majority opinion for not using legislative history in order to find the Congress' original intent, which could result into decisions based on personal preference.BedRoc Limited, 541 U.S. at 192 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The majority argued looking at the legislative history was unnecessary because of the clear language of the Pittman Act.

Specimens from the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Rond√¥nia have regularly been misidentified as Avicularia juruensis. One difference is the vivid yellow rings on the legs of A. rufa compared to the paler rings of A. juruensis. Description Mature individuals have brown carapaces with short golden hairs (setae) with a slight purple sheen. Females have abdomens with long greyish brown hairs on the front of the upper (dorsal) surface and the sides; males have these longer hairs evenly distributed. Both sexes have legs and palps with short brown hairs with a pink sheen and long brown hairs with darker bases and a whitish apex. The femora, tibiae and metatarsi of the legs have vivid yellow rings on the ends furthest from the body. Taxonomy Avicularia rufa was first described in 1945 by Schiapelli and Gerschman. Specimens from the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Rond√¥nia have been consistently misidentified as Avicularia juruensis. This area is south of the range in which A. jurensis is considered to occur. Apart from differences in the male and female genitalia, A. rufa has bright yellow leg rings, hairs (setae) with a whitish apex on the legs, and leg I shorter than leg IV, whereas A. juruensis has paler yellow leg rings, leg hairs more uniformly coloured, and legs I and IV more-or-less equal in length. Venom The neurotoxic venom of Avicularia rufa (misidentified as A. juruensis) has been analysed for potential as an antimicrobial. 11 antimicrobial peptides were found, one of which (named juruin on the assumption that the species was A. juruensis) showed strong activity against fungi. The active components of the venom closely resembled those of other theraphosid spiders, such as Haplopelma schmidti.

She showed good form as a juvenile in 2011, winning the Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot and a valuable sales race at Newmarket Racecourse as well as being placed in the May Hill Stakes and the Fillies' Mile. In the following year she recorded an upset win in the Irish 1,000 Guineas before being sent to race in North America where she won the Garden City Stakes. She remained in training as a four-year-old and won stakes races at Belmont Park and Saratoga. Background Samitar is a bay filly with no white markings bred in England by the Wiltshire-based Norman Court Stud. As a yearling she was consigned to the Tattersalls sale in October 2010 and was bought for 39,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Gill Richardson. She entered the ownership of Nick & Olga Dhandsa and John & Zoe Webster and was sent into training with Mick Channon at West Ilsley in Berkshire. Samitar was from the sixth crop of foals sired by Rock of Gibraltar who won seven Group 1 races in a row, including the 2000 Guineas. He has gone on to sire a number of other top racehorses, including Society Rock, Eagle Mountain, Varenar (Prix de la For√™t) and Mount Nelson. Samitar's dam Aileen's Gift was unraced but produced several other winners including the Albany Stakes winner Nijoom Dubai. She was a granddaughter of Optimistic Lass, who won the Nassau Stakes in 1984 and was the female-line ancestor of Golden Opinion, My Dream Boat and Alice Springs. Racing career =2011: two-year-old season= Samitar was ride in her first five races by Jamie Spencer. She made her debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 27 May in which she started at odds of 8/1 and finished third of the twelve runners behind Regal Realm. Despite her defeat she was stepped up in class for the Group Three Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot on 17 June and started a 16/1 outsider in a thirteen-runner field headed by the Fillies' Sprint Stakes winner Teolane. After being restrained by Spencer in the early stages she was switched to the left approaching the final furlong, took the lead in the closing stages and won by three quarters of a length from Inetrobil. After the race Channon said \\"I believed in this filly and this was the plan... The 1,000 Guineas is so far away, but she's a nice filly. I will give her a break and probably bring her back for the backend\\". After a break of over two months Samitar returned in the Tattersalls Millions Median Auction Stakes at Newmarket on 27 August ain which she started the 11/10 favourite but was beaten a short head by the colt Mehdi to whom she was conceding one pound in weight. Two weeks later the filly was stepped up in class and distance for the Group Two May Hill Stakes over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse and finished strongly to take third place behind Lyric of Light and Fallen For You. Samitar faced Lyric of Light and Fallen For You again in the Group One Fillies' Mile at Mewmarket on 23 September. After leading for most of the way ahe was challenged by Lyric of Light and was beaten a head into second place after a sustained struggle over the final furlong. On her final appearance of the season she started the 5/4 favourite for the Tattersalls Millions 2yo Fillies' Trophy (a race for horses sold at Tattersalls) over seven furlongs at Newmarket on 1 October. Ridden by Sam Hitchcott, she tracked the leaders, took the lead approaching the final furlong and stayed on well to win by one and a quarter lengths from Hazel Lavery. =2012: three-year-old season= In early 2012 Samitar was bought privately by Martin S. Schwartz. She began her second season by finishing unplaced in another Tattersalls sales race over six furlongs at Newmarket on 18 April and was then sent to France for the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in which she finished ninth of the thirteen runners behind Beauty Parlour. On 27 May at the Curragh, Samitar was one of eight fillies to contest the Irish 1000 Guineas in which she was ridden by Martin Harley and started at odds of 12/1. Homecoming Queen (horse) started favourite after a nine-length win in the 1000 Guineas while the other runners included La Collina (Phoenix Stakes) and Yellow Rosebud (Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial). After racing in third place behind Homecoming Queen, Samitar took the lead approaching the final furlong and stayed on well to win by one and a half lengths from the 33/1 outsider Ishvana. Her victory gave both her trainer and her jockey their first classic race success. After the race Harley said \\"It was a big opportunity to be given my first ride in a Classic. The boss has given me a lot of chances and to give me a ride like this in a Classic is unbelievable. She travelled like the winner the whole way\\". Explaining the filly's poor form in her last two starts Channon said \\"She didn't run badly [in France] but she made the running and she should have been held up. It was my fault for running her in a sales race at Newmarket before that, I was trying to be clever dropping her back to six furlongs. She needed some decent ground and she's got it now\\". On her next appearance Samitar started the 9/2 third favourite for the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. After disputing second place for mot of the way he was outpaced in the closing stages and finished fourth behind Fallen For You. She was then sent to the United States for the Grade II Lake George Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Saratoga Race Course on 25 July and finished a close third, beaten a neck and a head by Centre Court and Better Lucky. Following the race she was moved permanently to the United States where she was trained by Chad Brown. On 15 September, Samitar, ridden by Ramon Dom√≠nguez, started odds-on favourite for the Grade I Garden City Stakes over nine furlongs at Belmont Park. Her rivals included Karlovy Vary (Ashland Stakes), Tannery (Kilboy Estate Stakes) and Somali Lemonade.

It is the only extant species in the genus Notopus. Description Notopus dorsipes has a carapace which is broadened anteriorly and regularly convex from side to side with no median dorsal carina. There is a transverse ridge of small spines between the larger antero-lateral spines on an otherwise smooth surface. The front border of the orbit is less than half the width of carapace at its widest point and has five fronto-orbital spines. The antero-lateral borders have a single spine. The thin eye stalk folds backwards and downwards obliquely. The dorsal border of the cheliped palm lacks spines. The fifth pereiopod, is slightly smaller compared to the preceding pereiopods. The pereiopods are fringed with long, thin bristles with a broad dactylus and a flattened merus and carpus. The carapace length is up to 25mm. The carapace is coloured bright reddish-brown with white mottling and there is a pair of obvious spots on either side of the carapace near the middle. Distribution Notopus dorsipes is found in the Indian and Pacific Oceans from the Red Sea and eastern Africa to Japan to the Great Barrier Reef, although there are few records from the Sunda Shelf region in south-east Asia. It was recorded in the Mediterranean for the first time in 1964 off Israel and off the Egyptian coast in 2000 and 2016. The species is now most likely established in the Mediterranean and the probable route of colonisation was from the Red Sea via the Suez Canal, i.e. Lessepsian migration. Biology Notopus dorsipes is a burrowing animal of shallow seas with sandy substrates. To burrow it lifts the anterior end of its body using the chelipeds digging backwards at an angle. The chelipeds are used to push the animal backwards while burrowing. The burrowing is quick, the flattened and spade-like dactylus of the periopods is used to burrow, and the crab can bury itself completely in the sand in a matter of seconds.

It is located between the squares Plaza de Independencia and Plaza de los Coches. The name \\"Puerta del Reloj\\" responds to the clock with which it was crowned at the beginning of the 18th century. While the name of Boca del Puente is due to the fact that during the colonial period, a drawbridge was raised at the foot of the channel of San Anastasio, which linked the walled city to the legendary Getseman√≠ neighborhood. In addition the bridge served like defense of the city, since in case of enemy attack, this one was raised to prevent the access of buccaneers and pirates. Also the gate was protected by the bastions of San Pedro Ap√≥stol (now disappeared) and the one of San Juan Bautista. It has a Postclassic style in its facade, precursory of those that advocated the treaties on fortification of second half of 18th century. The Puerta del Reloj is the work of the military engineer Juan de Herrera y Sotomayor, founder of the Cartagena Academy, and its style recalls the facade of the main church of the Monasterio de San Francisco in the Colonial City of Santo Domingo. In fact both gates present a half-point Roman arch, flanked by two pairs of Tuscan columns, and the same entablature with a frieze decorated with triglyphs. For the connoisseurs, this gate is one of the most successful works of the Spanish- American Fortification School and possibly one of the best preserved in the New World, as it strictly complies with the opinions of the Vauban school. Among the locals this gate is known as Boca del Puente, but for non-natives of Cartagena it is simply the Puerta del Reloj. History This building has witnessed the great physical and social changes that the city has suffered for more than five centuries; Being in its origins, the entrance of the city, to be considered today as a tourist site of great historical value, which is no longer visited by slave merchants, but by people from all over the world. Starting in 1704, Herrara undertook the repair of the 1631 \\"Puerta del Puente\\" or Gate of the Bridge, which overlooked a wooden bridge dating from 1540. This was a wooden viaduct that passed over the Cano de San Anastasio, a seawater rivulet separating the island of Getseman√≠ from the island of Calamar√≠. This 1631 main gate of the city from when the walled enclosure was complete, was partially destroyed by Bernard Desjean, Baron de Pointis. In the 1704 repair, Juan Herrera y Sotomayor added the Baroque portal and the four Tuscan columns that adorn it, adding also, two side bombproof vaults for the storage of food and ammunition. In 1874, a clock was placed in that lodging that was brought from the United States, and after 63 years it was replaced by the present, imported from Switzerland, being transferred the first to the Templo de Torices, in the city.

Epstein. The script, style, and look are heavily influenced by 1970s Euro lesbian vampire films. The film is distributed in North America on VOD and DVD/blu-ray by Launch Over and VHS by SRS Media. Description Chris Hallock of the Boston Underground Film Festival, where the film had its world premiere on March 27, 2016, calls it, \\"a love letter to offbeat lesbian vampire films that offers powerful discourse on self-identity, feminism, and the violence wrought from religious dogma.\\" The film is notable for reversing the typical structure and focus of lesbian vampire films, with ambush bug of Ain't it Cool News noting, \\"The lesbian vampire is not new in the realm of horror, but whereas in the past, male filmmakers did their best to make lesbianism seem both erotic as well as the outcast other, this film actually makes these vamps sympathetic and shifts gears to change the subject to male oppression versus judgment upon free-spirited feminine wiles.\\" Starburst Magazine's Andrew Marshall examined the film's religious and political allegory in which the words of an ancient religious leader are corrupted over time in order to build favorable power structures: \\"Through its sex and violence, the film examines the perception of women in an oppressively masculine society, one in which they are taught obedience and complacency, remaining the unwitting victims of theocratic doctrine weaponised by dogmatic fundamentalists. From sapphic symbolism misappropriated by the patriarchal religion to character names representing a disparate assortment of mythologies, the film gradually constructs a culture that could conceivably exist apart from whatever domain may or may not lie beyond the village's borders, while the rampant histrionic misogyny is not only believable within the story's context, but is also rendered all-too plausible by recent real- world developments.\\" Premise 2000 years after the great vampire Bathor established the village of Bathory, superstition and religious violence take over as the men and women battle for control. When the men are afflicted with a mysterious illness, they become certain that the vampire women of Bathory are responsible for their ills, and thus, the hunt begins!

He made his major league debut on June 30 against the St. Louis Cardinals, pinch-running for Stephen Drew and playing shortstop for one inning. On July 1, S√°nchez got his first major league at-bat as a pinch-hitter with the bases loaded and the Nationals trailing by a run with two outs in the ninth inning. After working the count full against Cardinals reliever Matt Bowman, S√°nchez took a pitch well outside, believing it was ball four for what would have been a game-tying walk. However, umpire Manny Gonzalez called it strike three to end the game. On July 7, inserted on a double switch to play shortstop in the tenth inning, S√°nchez lined a single up the middle off reliever Ian Krol of the Atlanta Braves for his first MLB hit.

A sequel to Bit.Trip Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien, Runner3 is part of the Bit.Trip series, starring the character CommanderVideo. The game was released on May 22, 2018 on Windows, macOS, and Nintendo Switch, and was released on the PlayStation 4 on November 13, 2018. Gameplay Runner3 is a rhythm platformer video game in which players take control of CommanderVideo, protagonist of the Bit.Trip series. =Core Levels= CommanderVideo runs forward automatically and the player controls actions such as jumping, sliding, and kicking to overcome obstacles and collect things. Everything that comes his way will hit in rhythm to the background music, so keeping the beat is crucial to getting through the game. There are goods scattered across every level. The most common are gold bars. There is a set amount of gold in each level, and collecting them increases the score. Second, the Mode-Ups. A mechanic across all Bit.Trip games is the Mode system; the higher the mode, the higher the scoring and the better the music. Although Moding-Up varies in Bit.Trip games, in the Runner series, the player needs to jump into a Mode-Up to immediately go up a Mode. There are five modes in the Runner games, in ascending order: Hyper, Mega, Super, Ultra, and Extra. The player starts at Hyper and works their way up. One notable difference is that in previous Runner games, the Mode-Up appeared as a red 3D plus; in Runner3, it is a blue boombox. Third, the Gems. Gems are on a path of their own, an alternate and harder path. Gems can be collected only once, and they are used to unlock cosmetic items. New mechanics such as riding vehicles and the ability to double jump have been introduced in this installment. While previous Runner games featured different routes through a level by jumping on vertical platforms, Runner3 has stages with alternate paths that branch off into the background. The game also features side-quests, called Hero Quests, in which CommanderVideo stops to interact with non-playable characters that, for example, might task him with collecting specific items in certain levels. Completing Hero Quests unlocks new playable characters. In addition to past characters from the Bit.Trip series, the game includes the Shovel Knight character from the game of the same name, Eddie Riggs from Br√ºtal Legend, and the Narrator, a caricature of voice actor Charles Martinet. There are 27 main levels, and three main worlds (Foodland, Spookyland, and Machineland), but each level has branching paths, secrets, and more variety in music and scenery. =Retro Challenges= Throughout the Runner series, retro challenges have been implemented for more hardcore players. In BIT.TRIP RUNNER and Runner2, the retro challenges are smaller levels based on older video games, and run on the same mechanics as the main game, but with only gold bars to collect. Runner3 has a different sort of retro challenge. The player has full control over CommanderVideo's movement, making it play as a more traditional platformer. There is a retro challenge for every core level. Each retro level has five \\"Gildan Coins\\", which can be traded in for other cosmetics. Development Runner3 was developed by video game development studio Choice Provisions. One focal point of Runner3's design was creating a rewarding and enjoyable experience for playing on any difficulty. Choice Provisions' co- founder Alex Neuse emphasized that many games rewarded only hardcore players and offered a lesser experience for playing on lower difficulties. Voice actor Charles Martinet reprised his narration role in Runner3 and had a playable appearance. Release Runner3 was announced in September 2016. In February 2017, Nintendo revealed that Runner3 would launch on the Nintendo Switch console in the latter half of 2017. However in August 2017, Choice Provisions announced that the game would not release until 2018. A physical version of Runner3 was announced by Nicalis on December 13, 2017. It was released on Steam and Nintendo Switch on May 22, 2018. Following the release, Choice Provisions had announced upgrades to the game, which will include such features as enemy density, more checkpoints, stair assist, bonk counter and gold bars and gems. Reception The video game aggregator site Metacritic gave the Nintendo Switch version a 73/100 while the PC version got 78/100. Kevin Tucker of Shacknews, who reviewed the Steam version of the game, gave it 9 out of 10. Seth Macy of IGN criticized the game‚Äôs ‚Äúoutdated‚Äù graphics and repetitiveness of levels.

In 1870 she became the first woman staff reporter on a Boston newspaper when she was hired by the Boston Post, and she continued to write for local newspapers until her death in 1909. She co-founded the New England Woman's Press Association, and was an officer in several national press groups. White was a strong supporter of women's suffrage and women's education. In addition to her regular work as a journalist, she wrote and lectured on the subject of career paths for women. Having had a valuable mentor in suffragist Mary A. Livermore, she in turn mentored countless younger women over the course of her long career.  Early life and education  Sarah Elizabeth \\"Sallie\\" Joy was born in Brattleboro, Vermont, in 1847, the only child of Samuel and Rhoda Joy. She attended the Glenwood School for Girls. While still a teenager, she began publishing articles, poems, and short stories in local newspapers and journals, sometimes using the pen name \\"Flora Forrest.\\" After graduation she moved to Charlestown, Massachusetts (now part of Boston), where she lived with family friends.Burt (1998), pp. 366-367.  Career  She worked for some time as a schoolteacher before being hired as an assistant for the Loring Circulating Library. The Loring was a gathering place for authors and intellectuals at the time, and it was there that she met two women who became her mentors: a magazine editor named Mrs. Bingham, and the suffragist Mary A. Livermore. During this period she continued to publish articles in New England newspapers and journals. In the winter of 1869, when her employer increased her hours without raising her pay, she wrote in a letter to her mother that she planned to leave that job as soon as she could find something else, adding, \\"I will not be bullied by any man.\\" = Journalism = At Livermore's invitation, she went to work for the Woman's Journal in 1870. That was to be a temporary position, however, as Livermore and Bingham believed she would be more useful to the women's movement as a reporter for the mainstream press. Livermore introduced her to several editors, and in February she was hired by the Boston Post to cover the Woman Suffrage Convention in Vermont. She soon made a name for herself as \\"the bright particular star\\" of the convention. She was a fast and accurate reporter, and her writing style was engaging, with touches of wry humor.Burt (1998), pp. 368-369. That spring she traveled throughout New England reporting on the suffrage movement, and making news herself simply by being a woman reporter. One journalist, after describing her charming appearance and demeanor, declared that she had \\"made a reputation as a newspaper correspondent and reporter of which any man may be proud. And this is saying a great deal for a woman.\\" The Post offered her a permanent position, making her the first woman staff reporter on a Boston newspaper. In 1871 and 1872 she wrote an acclaimed series for the Post on Boston's North End Mission. Meanwhile, she supplemented her income by publishing letters and articles in several other newspapers, such as the New York World. She quit her job at the Post to get married in 1874, but soon returned to the workforce. During the late 1870s she wrote two women's columns for the Boston Sunday Times and another for the Detroit Free Press, as well as articles on a variety of topics for the Boston Daily Advertiser, the Boston Chronicle, and other papers. In the early 1880s, carving out her niche as a \\"woman's\\" writer, she took a home economics course so as to be able to write more knowledgeably on the subject. By 1885 she had secured a full-time position at the Boston Herald, where she remained for the next 21 years. Most of her work for the Herald appeared with no byline. From 1904 to 1906 she published a column under the pen name \\"Penelope Penfeather.\\" (Historian Elizabeth Burt suggests that the \\"ludicrous\\" pen name may have contributed to earlier historians' failure to take White seriously.)Burt (1998), pp. 372, 381, 392. = Club activities = During the 1870s White became secretary of the Middlesex County Suffrage Association. She was a founding member of the Daughters of Vermont and the Fortnightly Study Club of Dedham, and a member of the New England Women's Club.Burt (1998), p. 374. In November 1885, White hosted a meeting at her office with five other Boston newspaper women, and together they founded the New England Woman's Press Association. White served as president for the first five years, and again from 1907 to 1908.Lord (1932), pp. 49, 200, 204. In 1889, she was involved in the founding of the General Federation of Women's Clubs.Lord (1932), p. 207. She was elected president of the International Federation of Women's Press Clubs in 1891. Also in 1891, after finishing her term as NEWPA president, she established the Boston Woman's Press Club, which restricted admission to women working on Boston newspapers. The following year she was elected vice president of the International League of Press Clubs, a mixed-sex group in which she was the only female officer. She also served several times as a delegate to the National Editorial Association.Burt (1998), pp. 375. = Lecturing and authorship = As a nationally known woman journalist, she was often invited to speak on the subject of women in journalism.Boston Post (February 11, 1894). In 1891 she traveled to California to speak at a meeting of the Pacific Coast Woman's Press Association. At the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, she presented a paper on the role of women in the press.Burt (1998), pp. 376-377. The same year, she traveled to St. Paul to speak at the convention of the International League of Press Clubs. Although more women were entering the field, they were still a minority, and White was surrounded by prominent male journalists. She wrote to her daughter afterwards, \\"I was the one woman to make a speech at the banquet, and was said to have made the best speech of the evening. When I tell you that Murat Halstead, Col. De Long, and two members of Congress made the other speeches, you may imagine that I felt proud.\\" White also wrote and contributed to books about various occupations open to women. After taking a home economics course in the 1880s, she wrote two books for women about housekeeping and cooking. She wrote the chapter on \\"Newspaper Women\\" in Frances Willard's Occupations for Women; two years later, she published her own book on the subject, Business Openings for Girls. She contributed a series of \\"letters to American girls\\" to George J. Bayles's 1905 book, American Women's Legal Status, with such titles as \\"Your Place in Life,\\" \\"The Girl and the Professions,\\" \\"The Architect and the Decorator,\\" \\"The Private Secretary and the Library Worker,\\" and \\"The Life of Home, the Ideal Life.\\"Bayles (1905), p. 2.  Personal life  Sallie Joy White (1897) She married musician Henry K. White, Jr. in 1874 and quit her job at the Post. The couple had two daughters, Bessie and Grace. In 1879, shortly after the birth of their second daughter, Henry moved to California, leaving Sallie to support herself and the children. Her widowed mother came to live with her and care for the children while she worked.Burt (1998), p. 370. White later dedicated her book, Housekeepers and Home-makers, to her mother, \\"the best housekeeper and the dearest home-maker I ever knew.\\"White (1888), p. v. She died of anemia at her home in Dedham, Massachusetts, on March 25, 1909, after a long illness.Boston Globe (March 26, 1909).

After the House of Habsburg established itself in the 11th century, it grew in power. Various domains were added to its empire in central, eastern and western Europe. The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs between 1438 and 1740, and again between 1745 and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. The house also produced kings of Bohemia, Germany, Hungary, Croatia, Portugal, Spain, England and Ireland, as well as rulers of several Dutch and Italian principalities amongst many others. The Austrian Empire was declared as the Holy Roman Empire dissolved itself and became a successor state. The former Holy Roman Emperor Francis II became the Emperor of Austria. In accordance with tradition and the titles that were already held, he promulgated the grand title to codify the most important monarchical titles of various countries and territories under Habsburg rule, and also of titular rulers of former possessions. With the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 the grand title was again slightly modified. Although the Austrian emperor was also the nominal head of the German Confederation, this was not included in the grand title. The grand title was not a complete listing of all the titles held; instead it ends with an etc. There were also a middle title and a small title. The empress was also given the feminine version of the title.  Grand title  The full title (in German) of the Austro-Hungarian monarch as of 1914 was: which translates to:  Explanation of the individual titles listed in the grand title in their order  =Emperor of Austria= In 1804 Holy Roman Emperor Francis II foresaw the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, so he sought to preserve his family's imperial status by creating the new title \\"Hereditary Emperor of Austria\\". =Apostolic King of Hungary, King of Bohemia= The kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia were originally elective monarchies, but like many elective monarchies heredity was respected. Ferdinand, the future Holy Roman Emperor, married the daughter of King Vladislaus II (who held both kingdoms), and when Vladislaus' son died Ferdinand was elected in 1526. Eventually his descendants made the throne hereditary. =King of Dalmatia= Dalmatia became a crown land of the Habsburgs with the Treaty of Campo Formio and finally following Napoleon's defeat. It was previously claimed by the Habsburg emperors in their capacity as kings of Hungary and Croatia, as it was part of the Croatian and later Hungarian royal title since the High Middle Ages. =King of Croatia= In 1102 the Croatian nobles agreed to share the same King as Hungary. In 1527 Ferdinand I was elected king, and the title made hereditary. =King of Slavonia= In the 1490s king Vladislaus II of Hungary officially included Slavonia into the royal title. In 1526 when Ferdinand I was elected king he inherited the title and passed it to his descendants. =King of Galicia and Lodomeria= Galicia and Lodomeria was annexed by Austria in the First Partition of Poland, creating a new kingdom for the Habsburgs. The title had been claimed by the Kings of Hungary in the Middle Ages. =King of Illyria= With the re-annexation of the Illyrian provinces in 1815 the Habsburgs created a new crown land. Although abolished in 1848, the title was kept. =King of Jerusalem= The Kingdom of Jerusalem was abolished upon its conquest by the Egyptian Mamluks in 1291 AD. The Habsburgs were one of many dynasties to claim the title. They inherited it through the House of Lorraine. In the 18th century, the title was added by Leopold I of Lorraine, Francis I's father, in order to claim a royal title. =Archduke of Austria= In 1282 King Rudolf I of Germany enfeoffed himself with the Duchy of Austria. His descendant Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor officially elevated it to an archduchy in 1453, confirming a 1356 forgery by Duke Rudolf IV. =Grand Duke of Tuscany= Following the War of the Polish Succession, future Holy Roman Emperor Francis I was forced to exchange his native Duchy of Lorraine for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. He later passed the grand duchy to a younger son, but the main branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine continued to use the title. =Grand Duke of Krak√≥w= The Free City of Krak√≥w was incorporated into the Austrian Empire in 1846 following the Krak√≥w Uprising, and transformed in a crown land under the name of Grand Duchy of Cracow. It was later incorporated into Galicia. =Duke of Lorraine= The male line of the original House of Habsburg went extinct with Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor. His daughter Maria Theresa married the aforementioned Francis, Duke of Lorraine (later Emperor Franics I), and their progeny became the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. =Duke of Styria= Rudolf I of Germany enfeoffed one of his sons as Duke of Styria. The title passed down to the Leopoldian line, which became the sole remaining branch of the House of Habsburg after the death of king Ladislas the Posthumous, last descendant of the senior, Albertinian line. =Duke of Carinthia= In 1335 Otto, Duke of Austria was enfeoffed as Duke of Carinthia. The title passed down with the Leopoldinian line. =Duke of Carniola= The March of Carniola was part of the Habsburg domains since Rudolf I of Germany, although it was leased to the House of Gorizia until 1335. In 1364, duke Rudolf IV of Austria elevated it to a duchy. The title passed down the Leopoldinian line. After the death of Ferdinand I, the Inner Austrian domains (Carniola, Styria and Carinthia) were passed down to a junior branch which in 1619 finally reunited all the Austrian Habsburg lands. =Duke of Bukovina= In 1775 the Habsburgs annexed the northernmost part of the Principality of Moldavia and created the Duchy of Bukovina out of it. =Grand Prince of Transylvania= In the 16th century Transylvania was conquered by the Ottomans from Hungary and created as a separate principality. In 1711 the Habsburgs reclaimed it and added the Principality of Transylvania to their titles. In 1765 it was elevated to a Grand Principality. =Margrave of Moravia= Moravia was a Crown Land of Bohemia; thus when the Habsburgs became Kings of Bohemia they also acquired Moravia. =Duke of Upper and Lower Silesia= Silesia was originally owned by the Kingdom of Poland, but it was gradually broken up and acquired by Bohemia as a crown land. After losing most of historic Silesia to Prussia in the Silesian Wars, the Habsburgs consolidated what remained into Upper and Lower Silesia. =Duke of Modena= Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d'Este, daughter of the last Duke of the House of Este, married Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este, allowing this title to pass to the Habsburgs. It was subsequently lost to Sardinia during the unification of Italy. =Duke of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla= Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor acquired the Duchy of Parma after the War of the Polish Succession, but his daughter Maria Theresa lost it after the War of the Austrian Succession. =Duke of Auschwitz and Zator= Historically one of the duchies of Silesia, it was acquired by the Polish kings in the 16th century and incorporated into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Habsburgs acquired this title in the First Partition of Poland. =Duke of Teschen= The Duchy of Teschen was one of the Silesian Duchies that were part of the Bohemian Crown Lands. It was granted to Leopold I, Duke of Lorraine as a compensation for Mantua and Monferrato. When Leopold's son Francis I married Maria Theresa of Austria, the title returned to the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. =Duke of Friaul= This title was created by Maximilian I during the Italian wars in the early 16th century. Friuli had been part of the Holy Roman Empire, but it was lost to the Republic of Venice in 1420. The title was created in order to strengthen the Emperor's claim to the region, but the Habsburgs acquired Friuli only in 1797 with the Treaty of Campo Formio, and then again after Napoleon's defeat. It was lost to Italy in 1866. =Duke of Ragusa= Ragusa (modern-day Dubrovnik) was a maritime republic, which in the late Middle Ages recognized the suzerainty of the Hungarian kings. It was abolished by Napoleon in 1806 and incorporated to Austrian Dalmatia after his defeat, when the title was created. =Duke of Zara= Zara (or Zadar) is a city in Dalmatia, modern-day Croatia. In the Middle Ages, it was contested between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Republic of Venice. It was considered an integral part of the Kingdom of Dalmatia by both parts, but the title was assumed by the Hungarian kings in order to assert their rights over the city. It became a Habsburg domain for the first time with the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, and then again in 1813 after Napoleon's defeat. =Princely Count of Habsburg= Habsburg was the original seat of the House of Habsburg. =Princely Count of Tyrol= Duke Rudolf IV of Austria acquired the County of Tyrol in 1363. =Princely Count of Kyburg= Rudolf I of Germany claimed the County of Kyburg when its ruling dynasty went extinct. A brief period of rule by the city of Z√ºrich became permanent from 1452 when it was used as collateral for a loan the Habsburgs never repaid; they continued to use the title despite no longer being in possession of the land. =Princely Count of Gorizia and Gradisca= The Habsburgs acquired the County of Gorizia (German ) in 1500. In 1647, the nearby town of Gradisca and the surrounding area on the right bank of the Isonzo river was elevated to an immediate status and given to the Eggenberg family as a Principality. After its extinction in 1754, it was again merged with Gorizia. =Prince of Trent= In the 1300s Trent was annexed by Tyrol and thus was controlled by the Habsburgs. =Prince of Brixen= In 1803 the Prince-Bishopric of Brixen was secularized and annexed by the Habsburgs. =Margrave of Upper and Lower Lusatia= Lusatia was a Crown Land of Bohemia. =Margrave in Istria= Central Istria was acquired by the Habsburgs in the late 14th century. In 1466, they acquired the eastern parts, as well, and added their Istrian possessions to the Duchy of Carniola. With the annexation of Venetian Istria in 1797, the Habsburgs joined all their Istrian possessions into one unit and revived this title which had been abandoned in the late 13th century. =Count of Hohenems= When the male line of the original counts of Hohenems died out in 1759 the county came under suzerainty of the House of Habsburg. =Count of Feldkirch= When the last count of Feldkirch Frederick VII of Toggenburg died in 1436 the county passed back under the suzerainty of the House of Habsburg. =Count of Bregenz= After 1451 the title of count of Bregenz was held by the House of Habsburg and Bregenz was incorporated into the duchy of Austria. =Count of Sonnenberg= Sonnenberg was a partition of Waldburg and was annexed by the Archduchy of Austria in 1511. =Lord of Trieste= By the Peace of Turin in 1381, Venice renounced its claim to Trieste and the leading citizens of Trieste petitioned Leopold III of Habsburg, Duke of Austria, to make Trieste part of his domains. =Lord of Cattaro= After the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, it passed to the Habsburg Monarchy. However, in 1805, it was assigned to the French Empire's client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy by the Treaty of Pressburg, although in fact held by a Russian squadron under Dmitry Senyavin. It was restored to the Habsburg Monarchy by the Congress of Vienna. =Lord on the Windic March= Since the 11th century, Carniola was known under the double name of Carniola and the Windic March. In 1282, a cadet branch of the House of Gorizia was enfeoffed with part of the region, which became known as the County in Metlika and in the Windic March. In 1374, the county was acquired to the House of Habsburg who assumed the title of Lords of the Windic March. =Grand Voivode of the Voivodeship of Serbia= The Voivodeship was formed by a decision of the Austrian Emperor in November 1849, after the Revolutions of 1848/1849. It was formed in accordance with privilege given to Serbs by the Habsburg emperor in 1691, recognizing the right of Serbs to territorial autonomy within the Habsburg Monarchy. Subsequent use After 1918, the grand title was invoked for historical commemorative reasons in two Habsburg burial ceremonies in Vienna. At the burial of the last empress, Zita (1916‚Äì18), on 1 April 1989 in the imperial mausoleum, three prayers were said for the deceased by a speaker commissioned by the family, before the gate was opened and the sarcophagus was borne into the mausoleum. The first prayer started with the feminine form of the grand title: \\"Zita, Empress of Austria, crowned Queen of Hungary, Queen of Bohemia ...\\". In the list of ducal titles, the title of Duchess of Parma claimed by the Habsburgs was omitted, as she had a closer tie to Parma. Her father, Robert of Parma, was the last Duke of Parma (1854-1860) and as a pretender to that title she was a princess, even though she was not born until 1892. Thus the title ended with \\"Infanta of Spain, Princess of Portugal and of Parma\\". Zita's son Otto von Habsburg was buried on 16 July 2011, and a prayer was said in the mausoleum: \\"Otto of Austria, first Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary, royal prince of Hungary and Bohemia ...\\" The titles of King of Jerusalem and Archduke of Austria were omitted. No Austrian emperor was actually sovereign over Jerusalem, and in 1961 Otto had renounced all claims of sovereignty in the Republic of Austria.

Biography The daughter of William and Ada Luker, both artists, Burrell was born in London and studied at the South Kensington Art School. Her parents put her to work as an art teacher before she had completed her training there. She earned a scholarship to the Bushey School of Art, where she studied with Hubert von Herkomer. Some of her miniatures were accepted for display at the Royal Academy of Arts. She left England for Cape Town where she married Philip Burrell. Burell returned to England for the birth of her daughter; unfortunately, her husband suffered a heart attack while boarding a ship to rejoin them. In 1912, Burrell became a member of the Royal Miniature Society. She returned to Ottawa in 1912, where she painted members of Ottawa society. Unable to return to England due to World War I, she moved to Victoria where she operated a boarding house for a time. From 1916 to 1919, she lived in Hollywood, where she painted portraits of film stars. She returned to England and established a studio in Knightbridge where she painted two watercolour portraits a day at five guineas each. An early customer was Lucy Baldwin who was the Prime Minister's wife and she became a friend. She enjoyed good custom for some years but she found the task difficult. She met E.G.John Moore who was divorced, he had been a civil servant and was once the vicar of Amblecote. Burrell married Moore in 1922; the second marriage lasted six months. With Lucy Balwin's patronage she started to create larger portraits in oil paints. Commissions from Lucy for paintings of herself and a daughter and another of her grandson in addition to water colours of the interiors of 10, Downing Street were part of her work. She moved to India in 1929 and painted members of the royalty there. In 1931, she returned to London with a six-month stopover in Cairo. Burrell was awarded a grant by the artists' general benevolent fund for her support in 1952. She died in London in 1971. Her daughter, Philippa Burrell, wrote an autobiography, The Golden Thread, which contains accounts of her experiences with her mother. Her work is included in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Bushey Museum, the University of Hull Art Collection, the Djanogly Art Gallery at the University of Nottingham, the Ashmolean Museum, the Herkomer Museum, Landsberg am Lech in Bavaria and the National Gallery of Canada. In 1979, the National Book League in London exhibited her work.

This church and its convent are located in the Plaza de San Pedro Claver. The church is part of a set of religious buildings that is complemented by the Cloister of San Pedro Claver and the archaeological museum. It was built between 1580 and 1654, under the parameters of colonial constructions. Originally known as the church of San Juan de Dios, it has been called the church of San Ignacio de Loyola since 1622 and is now known as San Pedro Claver. The church is colonial, except for the dome, in 1921 the colonial dome was eliminated and the present dome was erected, the work of French Gaston Lelarge. At its altar lie the remains of Saint Peter Claver, who died in 1654 in Cartagena, after devoting practically all his life to evangelizing and redeeming the black slaves of New Granada. Description It suffered many vicissitudes after the expulsion of the Jesuits, first ordered by Charles III of Spain in 1767, and then in the years 1850 and 1861, during the early years of the republican era. For many years it served as a park to the adjacent barracks, which occupied part of the house-school of the Company of Jesus. Its architecture corresponds to the style called \\"Jesuitic\\", of type denominated \\"of preaching\\". Much of the fa√ßade was carved in stone from the island of Tierrabomba, and inside, at the bottom of the marble main altar imported from Italy by Bishop Eugenio Biffi, lie the relics of the owner in a golden bronze and glass urn, gift of Pope Leo XIII. In 1921 the typical orange half was eliminated and the present dome, the work of Lelarge, was erected. The front of the church departs from the Baroque style of other entrances. There is a second floor above the chapels, which are intercommunicated through arches of half point and covered with arista vaults. This church has an organ and a choir similar to those of the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran in Rome. The interior of the church of the Company is distinguished by the severity of its architectural elements, in contrast to the Baroque profusion used by Jesuits in other parts of Spanish America. Its facade is considered as the richest and most monumental of Cartagena.

Throughout this period she was the party's only female deputy in the assembly.Ingrid Langer: Zw√∂lf vergessene Frauen. Die weiblichen Abgeordneten im Parlament des Volksstaates Hessen, ihre politische Arbeit ‚Äì ihr Alltag ‚Äì ihr Leben, Frankfurt 1989, .  Life  = Provenance and early years = Elisabeth Hemmes was born in Bensheim, then as now a prosperous mid-sized town located halfway between Darmstadt and Mannheim. (1840-1925), her father, was a teacher who later achieved notability as the director of the Royal Deaf-Mute Institute (\\"Bensheimer Gro√üherzoglichen Taubstummenanstalt\\") and as the author of a pioneering six-year teaching programme for the deaf-mute. Despite her father's pedagogic career, when his daughter also became a teacher, she did so only in the teeth of her father's opposition. She taught English and French at secondary schools in Vallendar and Cologne. When she was 28 Else Hemmes married Karl Hattemer (1869‚Äì1913), one year her senior and, like her, a secondary school teacher. His family came, originally, from Gau-Algesheim (near Mainz). By the time of her husband's relatively early death the marriage would have produced four recorded children. In 1901 the couple relocated to Darmstadt where Karl Hattemer taught at the Neue Gymnasium (secondary school - subsequently subsumed into the \\"Ludwig-Georg Gymnasium\\". After she was widowed, in 1913, Elisabeth Hattemer increased her involvement in social and political matters. Her commitments included work for the \\"City Poverty and Welfare Operation\\" (\\"St√§dtische Armen- und F√ºrsorgedeputation\\"), the \\"Darmstadt Catholic Girls Protection League\\" (\\"Katholischer M√§dchenschutzverein Darmstadt\\") and in the \\"Catholic Women's Association\\". = Politics = Elisabeth Hattemer was a member of the Centre Party (Hessen). Military defeat in 1918 had been followed by a wave of revolutions across the country during 1918/19. The Grand duke, after refusing to abdicate, had been forced from his throne, and by 1919 the Grand Duchy of Hesse had become the People's State of Hesse (Volksstaat Hessen). The old bicameral legislature had been replaced by the unicameral \\"Landtag\\", its franchise broader and the voting systems more direct than before. Following the first election, held on 26 January 1919, the Centre Party vote share entitled it to 13 of the 70 seats. There were few women. However, Elisabeth Hattemer was elected to the assembly, after which she continued to be elected in successive elections up to and including the 1932 election. She was one of only five members with this record of continuity. During the Weimar years she was one of just twelve female members in the chamber, and the only woman sitting as a member for the Centre party. Her particular focus was on girls' education and social welfare, also backing measures designed to help the socially disadvantaged. = Beyond politics = A record from the Darmstadt branch of the Caritas (Catholic charity organisation) records that from March 1925 the Centre Party Landtag member, Mrs Elizabeth Hattemer, was the head of the Caritas secretariat set up, initially, on land belonging to the priory of St. Ludwig, (and which relocated to an address along the H√ºgelstra√üe in 1926). She continued to play a prominent co-ordination role within the city's Caritas organisation for many years, although in 1937 the leadership function was taken over by Valentin Degen. Later she became a member of the Caritas board for the diocese. Another focus of her work was the Darmstadt regional theatre, of which she was a member of the supervisory board (\\"Verwaltungsbeirat\\"), and which was at this time enjoying a strong reputation both for staging classical productions and for some modern pieces that confronted contemporary morality and preconceptions. Till 1939, when she moved house, Elisabeth Hattemer was living at an address in the Hermann Street (\\"Hermannstra√üe 43\\") which also accommodated the Darmstadt Caritas secretariat, the Children's Welfare office of the Darmstadt branch of the Catholic Women's Association, and its children's day-care center. Shortly before the outbreak of war the Nazi authorities, who always nurtured suspicions of any community involvement by \\"proxies\\" for the Roman Catholic Church, closed down the day-care center. A few years later, the failed assassination attempt against Hitler in July 1944 failed in its primary objective, but was highly effective in unnerving the government, which promptly dusted down a long list of people who had been politically active as non-Nazis before 1933. It turned out that many names on the list belonged to people who had fled abroad or died. Nevertheless, on the night of 22/23 August mass arrests took place across Germany. Elisabeth Hattemer's name was on the list and an attempt was made to arrest her. However, possibly aware of what was about to happen, she had taken the opportunity to move to live with her son in nearby Viernheim, which was sufficient to preserve her from arrest. After the war ended, in 1945, she continued to support her son with his youth work, and renewed her involvement with the Catholic Women's Association.

Succeeding on the death of his father Grigol Dadiani, he ruled‚Äîinitially under the regency of his mother Nino from 1804 to 1811‚Äîas a loyal subject of the Russian Empire. Levan Dadiani took little interest in the details of government and resigned in favor of his son, David Dadiani, in 1840, remaining a titular Prince of Mingrelia until his death.  Early life and rule  Levan Dadiani was the eldest son of Grigol Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia, and his wife, Nino, daughter of George XII, the last king of Georgia. Grigol died in October 1804, having placed his principality under the Russian suzerainty several months before. The Russian government confirmed, in absentia, the boy-prince Levan as Grigol's successor. At that time, Levan resided in Abkhazia, at the court of Kelesh Ahmed-Bey Shervashidze, whom Grigol had surrendered his son as an honorary hostage in exchange of the Abkhaz support in a power struggle in Mingrelia in 1802. The Russian military intervention, in April 1805, freed Levan, who, on his arrival in Mingrelia, took a solemn oath of fealty to the Russian monarchy and was confirmed as Prince of Mingrelia, receiving, on this occasion, the rank of major-general and Order of Saint Anna, 1st Class, in July 1805. Levan's accession was opposed by his uncle, Manuchar Dadiani, but the power struggle was eventually won by Levan's loyalists through the efforts of his mother Nino and the archbishop of Chqondidi.  In Russian service  As Levan was underage at his accession, the regency council presided by his mother was established. The council was ridden with internal tensions; Princess Nino was sidelined from the government and Levan assumed full ruling powers in 1811. He championed Russian interests in the region and took part, at the head of Mingrelian forces (\\"militia\\"), in Russian military campaigns. At the age of 16, he was present at the successful siege of Poti, in 1809, during the war against the Ottoman Empire. Next year, he aided the Russians in the conquest of the Kingdom of Imereti, which had, for centuries, claimed suzerainty over Mingrelia, and in an expedition against the Ottoman-held province of Akhaltsikhe, for which he received the Order of Saint Vladimir, 2nd Class. Levan was also instrumental in extending Russian influence into Abkhazia, where he supported his relative, Prince Sefer Ali-Bey Shervashidze. He took control of Samurzakano, a borderland between Mingrelia and Abkhazia, in 1813 and campaigned with a Mingrelian force in Abkhazia's interior in 1818 and 1824. In 1819 and 1820, Dadiani joined the Russian forces fighting the rebels in Imereti and Guria. Levan's younger brother Giorgi, also an officer in the Russian service, collaborated with the rebels, and was handed over by the Prince of Mingrelia to the Russian authorities. In August 1829, during the Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì1829), Dadiani and his Mingrelians, serving under Major-General Karl Hesse, were instrumental in defeating the Turks at Mukha- Estate. For his services, Levan Dadiani was made lieutenant-general in 1820 and granted the Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky in 1830.  Mingrelian state of affairs  Levan Dadiani's rule was autocratic. Personally, he was devoted to hunting and had little interest in the administrative affairs of his principality, which he had effectively relegated to his relative Didi-Niko Dadiani until the latter died in 1834. He still helped establish a school at the Martvili Monastery in 1830. Levan, anticipating riches by selling timber to Egypt, dreamed of turning Zugdidi, Mingrelia's chief town, into a modern city called Grigoriopolis and filed a request to the tsar Nicholas I to be allowed to do so in 1837, a few months after he hosted the Russian monarch in his possessions in September 1837. Nicholas I ruled the place could be named Grigoriopolis to appease Dadiani, but withheld his approval to grant to it a city status. After Niko Dadiani's death in 1834, Levan summoned his eldest son David, an energetic and educated officer in the Russian service in Tiflis, to manage a growing political crisis in the principality. David's efforts at modernization were not popular with the local nobility and even his father, causing the disillusioned young prince to retire from Mingrelia in 1838. With his health declining and Mingrelia facing a breakdown of law and order, Levan Dadiani resigned government duties in favor of David on 11 May 1840, retaining formal titles of a Mingrelian ruler. He died six years later in Zugdidi and was buried at the Martvili Monastery.  Family  Levan Dadiani was married twice. He wed first, in 1810, Princess Nino (died 1811), daughter of Prince Zurab Tsereteli (1747‚Äì1823), Mayor of the Palace (sakhlt-ukhutsesi) of Imereti. Levan's second wife was his late consort's younger sister Marta (died 1839), mother of his three sons and two daughters. * Prince David Dadiani (1812‚Äì1853), Prince of Mingrelia (1840‚Äì1853), major-general; * Prince Grigol Dadiani (1814‚Äì1901), general of the infantry and a poet; * Princess Nino Dadiani (1816‚Äì1886), Lady-in-waiting of the Imperial Court of Russia.

Such foreign campaigning is illegal under Turkish law. The Netherlands barred the aircraft of Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu from landing, and expelled Turkish Minister of Family and Social Policies, Fatma Bet√ºl Sayan Kaya from the country, when both tried to speak at rallies. In response, Turkey expelled the Dutch ambassador from the country, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan called the Dutch \\"fascists\\" and \\"remnants of Nazism\\" and accused the Netherlands of \\"massacring\\" Muslims in Srebrenica during the Bosnian War in 1995. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called Erdoƒüan's remarks \\"unacceptable\\" and a \\"vile falsification of history\\" and demanded an apology. Rutte also called for talks to resolve the impasse, adding that Turkey had crossed a diplomatic line.  Background  The Turkish referendum held on 16 April 2017 concerned a series of constitutional amendments that, if approved, would transform the country from a parliamentary democracy into a presidential system, under which President Erdoƒüan would be able to stand in two more elections, theoretically allowing him to govern as a powerful head of state until 2029. Critics of the proposed changes have expressed their fears of increased authoritarianism, whereas supporters claim the new system would make the Turkish state stronger and safer. In the 'Yes' campaign's attempt to persuade Europe's Turkish diaspora (many of whom still hold Turkish citizenship and thus are allowed to vote on the referendum) several high-ranking Turkish government officials sought to campaign in European cities with large Turkish populations. This included the Dutch city of Rotterdam, which contains a large portion of the 400,000 people of Turkish origin living in the Netherlands. The Turkish plans to campaign in European cities met a mixed reception in many European states, including the Netherlands. Overseas election campaigning, even in diplomatic missions, is illegal under Turkish law; yet most political parties in Turkey, including the ruling AKP, have flouted this law. The Turkish referendum came at a time when the Netherlands, too, was scheduled for its general election, which was held on 15 March 2017.  Escalation  Protesters at the Consulate General of the Netherlands in Istanbul On 3 March 2017, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte got confirmation from the Turkish authorities that a campaign manifestation was planned on Dutch territory, on 11 March. That day he announced on his Facebook page that the Dutch authorities would not cooperate.Elsje Joritsma, Enzo van Steenbergen, & Kees Versteegh, 2017, \\"Waarom laten ze die vrouw niet gewoon binnen?\\", NRC Next, 15 March 2017, p 6-7 On 6 March, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs received diplomatic mail requesting the admission of the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu with the intention of attending a campaign meeting. The same day, the Dutch foreign minister Bert Koenders replied in a note verbale that such a visit would not be allowed. This led to a series of telephonic contacts between Koenders and √áavu≈üoƒülu, as well as between Rutte and the Turkish prime minister Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m. According to √áavu≈üoƒülu, the Dutch government told him that it objected to a visit because it feared that it would lead to an electoral victory of the anti-Islamic Party for Freedom. The Dutch government has denied that such a motive was ever communicated to √áavu≈üoƒülu. Dutch diplomatic sources have indicated that √áavu≈üoƒülu offered Koenders to postpone a visit to a date after the Dutch elections on 15 March, e.g. to 18 March, but that this option was refused by Koenders who wanted to avoid any suggestion of a connection between the two events, fearing it might give the impression that the Dutch government deliberately escalated the situation. As an alternative for a ministerial visit to a mass gathering, the Dutch authorities offered to allow the visit of Turkish ex-parliamentarians, or √áavu≈üoƒülu visiting some closed session. When no consensus was reached, the Dutch made a final offer on 10 March: √áavu≈üoƒülu would be allowed access to the Turkish embassy in The Hague. This was accepted by the Turks. Then the Dutch demanded that no more than fifty people were invited to the meeting and the session would not be made public beforehand. While Turkey considered this condition, a third one was made in the evening: the names of those invited would have to be disclosed beforehand to the Dutch authorities. On 11 March 03:00, it was added that if Turkey would not accept this offer, landing rights might be refused. Turkey considered this to be an unacceptable infringement on its sovereignty and a deliberate attempt by the Dutch to sabotage the visit. Koenders told the Dutch press that the Netherlands would not facilitate a planned visit by √áavu≈üoƒülu to Rotterdam on 11 March, meaning that he would not meet with √áavu≈üoƒülu in any official capacity and that the Dutch state would not provide support in any way during his planned visit. Koenders cited risks to public order and security for the decision, and further stated that, although the Dutch government did not approve of the planned visit, he would not infringe upon the constitutional right of freedom of assembly. √áavu≈üoƒülu was very dismayed by what he saw as a Dutch ultimatum. He publicly requested \\"all Turkish citizens in the Netherlands\\" to come to the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam on 11 March. In an interview with CNN T√ºrk around 09:00 he claimed to have been threatened by the Netherlands and announced \\"heavy sanctions\\" if his visit was prevented. Koenders watched the CNN programme; when he heard the remarks by √áavu≈üoƒülu, he said \\"This is the signal\\" and immediately phoned Rutte. On 11 March, around 10:00, Rutte denied √áavu≈üoƒülu's government plane the right to land on Dutch soil. Mounted police in front of the Turkish consulate, Rotterdam Meanwhile, Geert Wilders, the leader of the anti-Islamic Party for Freedom, had on 8 March demonstrated against the visit in front of the Turkish embassy in The Hague, heading a small group of party candidates. Together with member of parliament Sietse Fritsma, he held a banner with the words Blijf Weg! Dit is ons land (\\"Stay Away! This is our country\\"). On 11 March, Wilders too became aware of √áavu≈üoƒülu's remarks; on 11:20 he sent a tweet to his many Twitter followers to re-tweet to Rutte: \\"don't let the Turkish minister into the country; do NOT let him land here\\". Later that day, Wilders in an interview with Al Jazeera claimed it was pressure from his party that convinced Rutte not to grant landing rights. At the time, the Turkish Minister of Family and Social Policies, Fatma Bet√ºl Sayan Kaya, was touring Germany. A visit to the Dutch town of Hengelo, close to the German border, had already been scheduled. On 11 March, the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service received information that Kaya would try to reach Rotterdam by car. She could freely cross the border because of the Schengen Treaty. A crisis centre was established on the twenty-third floor of the Rotterdam World Port Center to coordinate police actions. Earlier, the Turkish consul in Rotterdam had indicated to the Mayor of Rotterdam, Ahmed Aboutaleb, that there were no plans for such a visit. It now proved impossible to contact the consul, which gave Aboutaleb the conviction that the consul knew of Kaya's attempt. A motorcade was intercepted but the car with the minister managed to drive away. It reached a small yard at the rear of the Turkish consulate. The Dutch police stopped Bet√ºl Sayan Kaya's entourage just metres from the Turkish consulate building. About twenty police officers, forming a special forces unit, the Dienst Speciale Interventies, masked and equipped with body armour and automatic weapons, arrested ten members of Kaya's bodyguard, on suspicion of illegally carrying firearms. A German source had indicated they had obtained a German weapons permit. No arms were discovered. Two other men were also arrested, who later proved to be the Deventer Turkish consul and the charg√© d'affaires of the Turkish embassy. They in principle enjoyed diplomatic immunity. The twelve arrested men were detained for two hours and their passports were seized. A stand-off ensued for several hours in which the Turkish minister refused to leave the car. Just after midnight, a special heavy tow truck, a lift flatbed, was driven into the yard and prepared to vertically hoist the 3.5 tonne car onto the flatbed, with the minister still in it, to transport her back to Germany. The minister now left the car and demanded entrance to the consulate invoking the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The Dutch police had orders to arrest the minister if necessary.https://joop.vara.nl/nieuws/nederlandse-politie-mocht-geweld- gebruiken-turkse-minister Ultimately, she gave in to the police demands to leave the country. At the time, many news sources assumed that she had been declared persona non grata. She was, loudly protesting, taken to another car, a black armoured Mercedes,Bart Dirks & Natalie Righton, 2017, \\"Hoe twee vrienden kemphanen werden\\", Volkskrant. Vonk, 18 March 2017, p. 6-7 by masked Dutch police officers who accompanied her to a police station at Nijmegen near the Dutch‚ÄìGerman border. Her passport was seized.

Built in 1930, it is an architecturally distinctive stone building with medieval features, designed by Alfredo S.G. Taylor. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Childs Sports Building is located in a rural-residential setting south of the village center of Norfolk, on the north side of Windrow Road near its junction with Gamefield Road. This area is part of what was once a large country estate of the Childs family. The building is a 1-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of rough fieldstone and capped by a roof with clipped gables. It is roughly rectangular in plan, with a round turret rising at its northeast corner to a low-pitch conical roof. The interior and roof framing are done with massive timbers recycled from old barns, which were also the source of the rough planking on the interior walls. The ground floor offers indoor courts for playing squash, badminton, and fives, as well as men's and women's dressing rooms. The upper level has a trophy hall and a billiard room. The building was built in 1930 to a design by New York City architect Alfredo S.G. Taylor. Taylor spent many summers in Norfolk, and is credited with more than thirty commissions in the community. A number of them share the medieval features used in this building: the rough rustic stone and wood finishes, and heavy slate roof. Details of the building were published in American Architect and Building News after its construction. Taylor's work for the Childs family also included the Starling Childs Camp on Doolittle Lake, and the Tom Thumb House.

As Page Morton Black she was known for singing the \\"Heavenly Coffee\\" jingle on the company's televised advertisements and sponsored broadcasts. When Black died in 1983, she took over his charitable work with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation. Background Morton was born Page L. Mergentheim on October 15, 1912 and raised in Winnetka, Illinois. Her father was Morton Adolf Mergentheim, a lawyer and professor of law working in the Chicago area. For a period he was a partner in the law firm of Sigmund Zeisler. Her mother, Rose Heymann, was a classically trained pianist who had studied with Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler, wife of Sigmund. Morton's only sibling was Morton Alexander Mergentheim who was about 3 years older. They were both educated at New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois where her highest grade was 4th year. Career Morton came from an affluent family but her father lost his money on the markets so she moved to New York with her mother to find work. In 1940 at the age of 18 she was living with her mother on East 43rd Street, having changed her name from Mergentheim to Morton. Her occupation in the 1940 census was given as model, and one newspaper of the period indicates that she was connected to the John Robert Powers modelling agency.1940 Census Place: New York, New York, New York; Roll: T627_2648; Page: 3A; Enumeration District: 31-1028 When her father died in 1943, his obituary described her as an actress with the stage name of Page Morton. During the 1940s and '50s she sang and played piano in various New York clubs, hotel bars and restaurants including the Warwick Hotel's Raleigh Room, Caf√© Pierre, the Vanderbilt and the Sherry-Netherland. The band leader Guy Lombardo saw her perform in the Pierre and suggested to William Black that she could sing the advertising jingle for Chock full o‚ÄôNuts coffee. In the 1960s Morton started to work on radio and television shows. She appeared on the Guy Lombardo New Year's Eve special, sponsored by the Chock full o‚ÄôNuts company. In 1961 she had her own radio programmes, and appeared on two further New Year's Eve specials, one hosted by Lombardo and the other by Xavier Cugat. She released her first album for MGM called May You Always and sang a duet with Jimmy Durante advertising the coffee brand. Marriage William Black had started his business by selling nuts from a stand on Broadway with a $250 start-up fund. As the company grew, he began selling his own vacuum-packed blend of coffee that eventually accounted for 60% of his multi-million dollar turnover. In 1951 he divorced his first wife and married singer Jean Martin. She featured on sponsored radio and television programmes for Black and sang the \\"Heavenly Coffee\\" jingle. By 1960 Black and Martin were separated and divorced in 1962. Black married Morton in Connecticut on March 27, 1962.Original data: Connecticut. 1959-77 Connecticut Marriage File. Hartford, Connecticut: Connecticut Department of Public Health. After her marriage Morton featured for several years on the Chock full o‚ÄôNuts television advertisements and sang the \\"Heavenly Coffee\\" jingle. She also became a director of Chock full o‚ÄôNuts and worked with her husband's philanthropic ventures. Following the death of a friend and colleague in 1957, Black had contributed $100,000 to establish the Parkinson's Disease Foundation. Later he donated several million dollars to medical research. Morton became the unpaid secretary of the Foundation and following the death of her husband in 1983, she took over his role as the chairperson and remained so until 2012. Bon Repos When Morton married Black, they lived in a waterfront house called Bon Repos in Premium Point, New Rochelle, New York. Black purchased the 29-room mansion in 1955 from Tommy Manville and lived there with his second wife, Jean Martin, until their separation. Morton's mother Rose and her brother Alexander also lived in New Rochelle; Rose died in 1971 and Alexander in 1979. William Black died in March 1983 while he was still the chairman of Chock full o‚ÄôNuts. The business became the subject of a proxy battle with businessman Jerry Finkelstein, owner of the New York Law Journal. He hoped to take control, but when Black died, the directors appointed Dr. Leon Purdy as their new chairman. He had been Morton's physician several year earlier and she introduced him to her husband. Purdy first became a director of Chock full o‚ÄôNuts, later president, vice chairman and chief operating officer before his appointment as chairman. Parkinson's Disease Foundation Morton was the chairperson at the Parkinson's Disease Foundation for nearly 30 years. When she died in 2013, the Foundation published a paid notice in The New York Times with their condolences and appreciation of her work saying that \\"the Board of Directors, the staff, the supporters, and the many hundreds of scientists funded by the Parkinson's Disease Foundation (PDF) mourn the passing, and cherish the memory, of an exemplary, passionate and indefatigable leader...Page served brilliantly as our Chairman- strengthening us with her inspired nominations to our Board, enriching us with her deft leadership of our annual Bal du Printemps, and energizing us with her single-minded devotion to the reputation, success and financial health of our organization.\\" The Columbia University Medical Center also published a similar piece mourning the passing of Page Morton Black.

A second route of begins at Highway 121 and runs west to a junction with Lee County Route 132 (CR 132) and CR 173. A short spur route in Moro, Highway 78 Spur connects the parent route to Highway 238. All routes are maintained by the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD). Both segments of Highway 78 serve the Arkansas Delta, an extremely rural part of the state. Passing through only a few small towns, the highway's setting is a flat agricultural landscape in cultivation crossed by drainage ditches, swamps, and bayous. One of the original Arkansas state highways, Highway 78 was slowly extended in the middle of the 20th century during a period of rapid growth in the Arkansas Highway System. The Aubrey-Big Creek route was created in 1973, marking the last change for the highway designation until the addition of Highway 78 Spur in 2001. The entire route between Hunter and US 79 is designated as an Arkansas Heritage Trail, a route used by John S. Marmaduke's Confederate Missouri cavalry prior to the Battle of Helena during the American Civil War. Route description =Hunter to US 79= The route begins in southeastern Woodruff County at Highway 306 near Hunter. Running south as a section line road, the highway enters St. Francis County, passing through Posey before entering Wheatley. Highway 78 intersects two national east-west routes in Wheatley, Interstate 40 in the north part of the city, and US 70 in the southern portion. Following this intersection, Highway 78 takes a southeasterly turn and angles into Lee County. Entering from the county's sparsely populated northwest corner, Highway 78 passes through Nash Corner before a brief overlap with Highway 259 at South Plains. Now turning due south, Highway 78 enters the small town of Moro. Highway 78 Spur in downtown Moro offers access to Highway 238, leading toward Brinkley. Following this intersection, Highway 78 exits Moro to the southeast, intersecting US 79, where it terminates. =Aubrey to Big Creek= Highway 78 begins at Highway 121 in Aubrey in southern Lee County. The route runs due west as a section line road until crossing into the riparian zone for Big Creek. Highway 78 crosses McNulty Lake, created by a slow moving portion of Big Creek, on an open deck steel bridge. Shortly after this bridge, the highway terminates at an intersection of gravel county routes. History Highway 78 was designated as one of the original state highways on April 1, 1926. Running between US 70 in Wheatley and State Road 3., the route remained unchanged for almost 50 years. An extension north to I-40 on February 28, 1968 was part of a program to connect newly built Interstate highways with the US highways they paralleled. On July 29, 1970, the highway was extended by the Arkansas State Highway Commission (ASHC) to the current northern terminus at Highway 306.. A second segment of Highway 78 was created between Aubrey and a county road intersection near Big Creek on March 28, 1973 pursuant to Act 9 of 1973 by the Arkansas General Assembly.. The act directed county judges and legislators to designate up to of county roads as state highways in each county.
