Story  Last Alert's story begins on November 20, 1988. Guy Kazama, a commando in the Special Mission Unit, has been dispatched to the jungles of South America to rescue hostages upon a request from the Lloyd government. The request, however, was a trap, and Guy Kazama's unit is ambushed by an attack helicopter. Guy Kazama is the sole survivor of the ambush, and the antagonists of the game are introduced: an international arms band collectively known as the Force Project, whose ultimate goal is to rule the world. Its leaders are Colonel Jim Kadat of the Republic of Lybid, Mr. Tommy Lee of the Hong Kong mafia, Chairman Steve Lloyd of the Dual Foundation, and Dr. Che Garcia, a brilliant physicist. Following the ambush, Secretary Harvey Leonard, Director of the CIA, is entrusted by President Allman with eliminating the Force Project. For this, Leonard enlists the help of Guy Kazama, whom he finds in a cemetery mourning his comrades. Leonard tasks him with infiltrating a military base, Blue Rhinos, which contains stealth aircraft and has already been infiltrated by an agent by the name of Spartan. Guy, wanting to avenge his comrades, accepts. Infiltrating the base, Guy finds Spartan being held hostage at gunpoint at the base's gate. Spartan informs Guy that the stealth bombers are at the back of the factory before being rescued by him. Guy destroys the aircraft and, after a confrontation with a tank, escapes with Spartan in a stealth bomber on the base's runway. Meanwhile, the President's airplane has crashed on the eastern side of the Republic of Flett, a fictional arctic nation, where he is taken prisoner by an agent of the Force Project, Colonel Douglas Dark. Guy Kazama is sent by Leonard and his colleague Kay to the camp on top of Mount Alt where the President is being held to free him. Along the way, he rescues several hostages, is confronted by an imposter President, and defeats Dark. After the President is rescued, Leonard sends Guy Kazama to find and assassinate Colonel Kadat, who has gone into hiding. First, he has to sneak into a camp and rescue another soldier, Robert, from imprisonment. Robert informs Guy that Kadat has three bodyguards, Red, Blue, and Black, who each have information on Kadat and his whereabouts. After defeating these bodyguards, Guy Kazama confronts the Colonel, who wields an electric shock whip, and kills him. Mr. Lee holds a video conference with the other remaining heads of the Force Project who inform him of Kadat's death. As they've learned that Guy will use Mr. Lee's annual martial arts tournament to kill him, they present him with three of their toughest fighters. Mr. Lee also asks Dr. Garcia about the completion of his ultimate weapon, known as Indra. Dr. Garcia estimates that it will be completed within a month. Guy Kazama infiltrates the compound where the tournament is being held, kills Mr. Lee's fighters, and makes his way to the top of the tower in the middle of the compound where Mr. Lee awaits him. Guy Kazama kills Mr. Lee and sets his sights on Chairman Steve. Some time after Mr. Lee's death, Guy Kazama is seen on a cruise ship, where Steve Lloyd is giving a speech at a party in celebration of his Dual Foundation. Guy reveals to Kay that the man giving the speech is a body double for Lloyd and that the real Lloyd is somewhere else on the ship. Guy also reveals that he's planted explosives on the ship to create a diversion that will allow him to find Chairman Steve in the ensuing chaos. Guy Kazama makes his way through the party to the secret armory in the lower decks where he confronts and kills Chairman Steve. Following Lloyd's death, Dr. Garcia contacts the President, giving him an ultimatum of 24 hours before Indra destroys the world and challenging Guy Kazama to stop his plans. Guy arrives at a station on the Moon where Indra is being constructed. There he kills a resurrected Dark, destroys a creature known as the biomonster, and confronts Dr. Garcia, who flees on a space shuttle to Indra, which is revealed to be a space station orbiting the Moon. Guy follows shortly thereafter. Guy confronts and kills Dr. Garcia, who is revealed to be a cyborg. He warns Guy that, in order to stop Indra, he must destroy Indra, which will kill him. Guy destroys the supercomputer controlling Indra, which, in turn, destroys the space station. Guy falls to Earth in an escape capsule where he contacts Leonard to retrieve him from the ocean.  Gameplay  Last Alert features somewhat basic top-down shoot 'em up gameplay. In addition to a primary weapon which has unlimited ammunition, there are consumables such as a flamethrower, grenades, and a hovering turret. There are also minor RPG mechanics, such as a points system, class leveling, and weapon upgrades. In the game, the player gains experience points by killing enemies or completing objectives. These points allow the player to reach new classes, and each new class serves to raise the player's \\"vital\\", or health. Furthermore, gaining levels grants the player access to new primary weapons; the player starts with an M1911A1, but through leveling obtains an Uzi, an M16, an M203, an LMG, and a rocket launcher, each progressively more powerful than the last. The game has a number of stages hosted over six maps. Each stage has infinitely spawning enemies and, except for one, has a boss fight at the end. There are three variants of stages denoted by different colored markers on the hub map. Blue markers (Type A) indicate a mission where the only goal is to reach the end and kill the boss, red markers (Type B) indicate a stealth mission where firing anything other than your pistol will spawn more enemies, and yellow markers (Type C) indicate a mission with a special objective, such as freeing hostages. In addition to this, the player is required to reach the end of the stage under a certain time limit, which kills them instantly if it reaches zero. Any deaths result in a game over and require the player to continue from the beginning of the stage. Stylistically and gameplay-wise, the game is similar to Bloody Wolf. However, unlike Bloody Wolf, Last Alert is on a CD-ROM. This allows it more storage space, and it uses that storage space for voiced dialogue ‚Äì something that was uncommon at the time ‚Äì its soundtrack, and cutscenes.  Reception  The English version of the game has received a reputation for its cheesy dialogue, campy story, and incredibly poor voice acting. While it received generally warm reception when it was released and was especially praised for its graphics and music, it received criticism by some for linear and repetitive gameplay. It has, however, received praise for its snappy controls, balanced experience point system, and comedic value in the campy story, dialogue, and acting. The Japanese version, on the other hand, has received praise for its voice acting.

It is native to North America. It is commonly called the twice-stabbed lady beetle, because of the pair of red slashes on the black elytra of the adult insect. Both adults and larvae feed on scale insects. Description The adult Chilocorus orbus is a dome-shaped beetle some long with club-shaped antennae. The shiny black elytra bear two oval red patches and the ventral surface of the beetle is reddish. There are other species of black-with-red- spots lady beetle with which this insect might be confused, these being Axion plagiatum, Chilocorus kuwanae, and Olla v-nigrum, however in Chilocorus orbus, the red patches are nearer the head than they are in the other species. The larvae resemble miniature aligators, have long legs and are grey or blackish; they have elongated bodies covered with branching spines. The pupae are also blackish and spiny, but are broader and shorter than the larvae. Distribution and habitat Chilocorus orbus is one of about a dozen species of Chilocorus that occur in North America. It is predominantly found in the western states of Washington, Oregon and California, being replaced in other areas of the United States by other, closely-related species. It is a mostly arboreal insect, found in forests, plantations, orchards and gardens, wherever there are scale insects on which to feed. Ecology Both adults and larvae feed voraciously on scale insects on fruit trees, as well as on nut trees and ornamentals. The scales attacked include brown soft scale (Coccus hesperidum) on citrus, walnut scale (Quadraspidiotus juglansregiae), sycamore scale (Stomacoccus platani), California red scale (Aonidiella aurantii), San Jose scale (Quadraspidiotus perniciosus) and European fruit lecanium (Parthenolecanium corni). The young larvae puncture the scale insects and suck out their juices, venturing under the horny part of the scale to do so, while older larvae and adults chew the scales up and completely consume them.

In marine environments, this equilibrium level is sea level. In marine environments, changes in accommodation on long temporal scales is mainly determined by tectonics or by changes in eustatic sea level. In fluvial environments, changes in accommodation are controlled by the gradient, discharge and sediment supply. In the lower parts of river systems, the change of accommodation in the fluvial system is controlled by the changes in marine accommodation.

Uninjured, he got out and called his parents on his cellphone. Unsure of his exact location, he told them he believed he was near Lynd, and they drove out to pick him up; however they were unable to locate him. Swanson remained on the phone with them until he abruptly ended the call 45 minutes later after exclaiming \\"Oh, shit!\\" He has not been seen or heard from since. In the morning, his parents reported Swanson missing to police, who advised them to wait as such behavior was not uncommon for young men his age. Later that day, the circumstances of his disappearance became more complicated when his cell phone records showed he had been near Porter, from where Swanson had said he was, in a different direction. That information led to the discovery of his car, near Taunton. It is not known whether Swanson was aware of this discrepancy when he talked to his parents. Foul play has not been ruled out, but it has also been proposed that he might have accidentally fallen into the Yellow Medicine River, near where his car was found, and drowned, although extensive searches have not found a body. Land searches, with dogs, have continued in the area for several years. His parents successfully lobbied the state legislature to pass Brandon's Law, which requires that police begin investigations of missing adults promptly.  Background  A native of Marshall, seat of Lyon County in southwestern Minnesota, Swanson graduated from Marshall High School in 2007. He then chose to study wind turbines for a year at the Minnesota West Community and Technical College campus in Canby. Classes at Minnesota West ended for the academic year on May 13, 2008. Swanson stayed in Canby for the evening to celebrate with friends. At two different parties, he was observed to consume some alcoholic beverages but, his friends said, not enough to make him seem visibly intoxicated.  Disappearance  Swanson left Canby for the drive home before midnight. Just before 2 a.m., he called his parents on his cell phone, telling them he had driven his Chevrolet Lumina off the road and into a ditch from which he could not remove the car. He was not hurt and asked them to come to where he was and pick him up. Annette and Brian Swanson got in their pickup truck and drove out to where they thought he was, keeping him on the phone despite occasional hangups and drops. Brandon stayed with his car and tried to signal them by flashing his lights on and off, but they saw nothing. Nor did he see them do the same. Brandon finally gave up and told them he was leaving the car to walk toward lights he could see that led him to believe he was near Lynd, a small town roughly southwest of Marshall. He told his father to head for the parking lot of a local bar and wait for him there. Brian began driving there, talking to his son as he did. Shortly after 2:30 a.m., 47 minutes into the call, Brandon suddenly interrupted himself on the phone and said \\"Oh, shit!\\" Immediately afterwards, the connection was lost. Brandon has not been seen or heard from since.  Investigation  At 6:30 a.m., his parents reported Brandon missing to the Lynd police. They were told at first that it was hardly unusual for young men that age to stay out all night after the last day of college classes. Annette Swanson specifically recalled that one of the officers said it was Brandon's \\"right to be missing\\". alt=A road map showing Marshall as a larger yellow populated area on a white background near the lower right. Canby, Minneota, Porter and Taunton are along a black line marked as state highway 68 running straight toward the upper left. Lynd is near the bottom right. County boundaries are marked with olive-drab lines. Later that morning the Lynd police did start a search, but found no trace of Brandon in the town or outside. They requested that the office of Lyon County sheriff Joel Dahl assist them. To better focus the search, the sheriff's office obtained Brandon's cell phone records, which revealed that Brandon had been calling from the vicinity of Taunton, along State Highway 68, the main route to Canby, northwest of Marshall‚Äî from Lynd. Searching in that area, deputies discovered Brandon's abandoned car in a ditch off a gravel road along the Lincoln County line a mile north of Highway 68, bringing the office of that county's sheriff, Jack Vizecky, into the investigation as well. He told the media that the Lumina had gotten hung up on the top of an incline at the edge of the road, not seriously enough to damage the car but enough to keep the wheels from touching the ground on that side. There was nothing else found amiss with the car, and due to the grass and gravel in the area surrounding it, there were no tracks and thus no way to tell what direction Brandon might have started walking. His cellphone call had been routed through a tower at the intersection of County Routes 3 and 10 near Minneota, another town along Highway 68. By May 15, the call had been determined to have come from within of the tower; searchers were concentrating their efforts there. Since part of that circle included Yellow Medicine County to the north, authorities from that jurisdiction also took part. From that area, Dahl noted, a red light atop a Taunton grain elevator could be seen. It was possible, he thought, that that was what Brandon had seen that led him to believe Lynd was within walking distance. Ground searches were being complemented with a flyover by an aerial team; search dogs were also brought in from the Twin Cities. A team of bloodhounds from nearby Codington County, South Dakota, picked up a trail that largely followed the field roads west-northwest to an abandoned farm, then along the Yellow Medicine River to a point where it appeared to enter the stream. Brandon had mentioned passing fences and hearing nearby water, his father recalled. On the theory that Brandon might have drowned, boats from the state's Department of Natural Resources were deployed along the river, and gates were installed. In some areas in Lincoln County, the water had been deep on the morning of the disappearance, but had gone down since then, Dahl noted. Deputies also walked the river's banks, and horses and all-terrain vehicles were deployed in the surrounding area. However, Dahl ruled out a more organized, extensive ground search. = Later searches = After the original search found no sign of Swanson, most efforts were discontinued. Sheriff Vizecky continued to walk the of the Yellow Medicine in that area every day for 30 days. The Swansons left their porch light on all night every night as a symbol of their hope that Brandon would eventually return or be found; they still do. Searches resumed late that fall, after fields planted shortly after the disappearance had been harvested. Dogs on those searches continued to follow scents of human remains into an area northwest of Porter that had not been searched earlier. Efforts picked up again in the spring, after snow melted but before planting; a cycle that continued through 2011. By that time had been searched. In 2010, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension took over as lead agency on the case. It set up a tip line; by 2015, 90 leads had been reported that way. By that point, when official searches resumed, the area of interest had moved towards Mud Creek, a tributary of the Yellow Medicine north and northwest of Porter.  Theories  While the trail followed by one of the dogs went to the Yellow Medicine, and despite her son's last known words, Annette Swanson does not think he drowned there. After following the scent to the water, that dog continued up across the other side, and along that riverbank to another gravel road, where it continued north towards the Yellow Medicine County line and ended. \\"There really is nothing to indicate that he's in the river,\\" she told CNN. Brian Swanson also recalls that, any alcohol his son had consumed earlier in the evening notwithstanding, he did not seem disoriented or confused during their phone conversations. If Swanson is still alive, there are other possibilities although they appear remote. He could have intentionally disappeared, but his parents do not believe he would have done that. Vizecky said he could not rule out foul play, even though there was no evidence of it. \\"[S]omeone [could have been] in the shadows, and they got him that way,\\" he speculated.  Brandon's Law  After the searches, Annette Swanson was still struck by the initial response of the Lynd police that her son had \\"a right to be missing\\" when she told them how old he was. \\"I'm his mother and I knew something was horribly wrong,\\" she recalled later. She and Brian began lobbying for changes in state law that would require an investigation into the case of a missing adult to begin as soon as it is reported, much as was already required in cases of possibly abducted children. Annette met with Marty Seifert, minority leader of the state House of Representatives at the time, whose district included Marshall, in a local restaurant. The two talked about the problems she had experienced with the police when she reported her son missing. \\"She knew it wouldn't help in her son's case, but that it could help others in the future\\", Seifert recalled in 2015. Seifert introduced a bill called \\"Brandon's Law\\" that would make the required change by amending the law governing the state's existing Missing Child Program to change the word \\"child\\" to \\"person\\". He recalled considerable resistance at first from the state's law enforcement community as it was developed in committee. \\"Part of it had to do with privacy, especially regarding cell phones\\", he told the Marshall Independent. \\"Technology was emerging then, so there were discussions about privacy and when can they ping you and when can't they.\\" Dennis Frederickson introduced a companion bill in the State Senate. After it passed both houses (the House unanimously) in May 2009, Governor Tim Pawlenty signed it into law with the Swansons and their daughter Jamine in attendance at the ceremony. The effect of the change also required that police, in addition to determining in their preliminary investigation that the reported person is indeed missing, determine whether that person is potentially in dangerous circumstances. They must also notify other nearby law enforcement agencies promptly. Brandon's Law also clarifies that the agency taking the report is the lead agency investigating the case; the absence of that distinction had created some problems in the later phases of the initial search when three different counties were involved. Police were no longer allowed to refuse a report based on an initial belief that no criminal activity was involved, the brevity of the interval since the person was last seen, the possibility that the person may have intentionally disappeared, or the lack of a relationship between the missing person and the reporter. Following the governor's signature, the law took effect at the beginning of July 2009. Four other states have passed similar laws. Seifert left the legislature in 2010, but he still has the pen Pawlenty used to sign the bill into law. \\"I consider it one of the most important bills I authored in my 14 years. It will save lives.\\"  See also  * Disappearance of Suzanne Lyall, 1998 disappearance of New York college student whose parents also successfully lobbied for changes in law requiring faster and better coordinated police response in such cases * List of people who disappeared mysteriously: post-1970  References   External links  * Category:2000s missing person cases Category:Missing person cases in Minnesota Category:Lincoln County, Minnesota Category:Lyon County, Minnesota Category:2008 in Minnesota Category:May 2008 events in the United States ","title":"Disappearance of Brandon Swanson"},{"id":"57299649","text":"Smicronyx centralis is a species of true weevil in the beetle family Curculionidae.

The company designs and manufactures a diverse selection of product for the bath, including whirlpool tubs, sinks, toilets, shower doors and bathroom accessories.  History  =Early years= The earliest roots of the company trace back to 1907 when two brothers from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania , Clark and John M. Beggs, built a factory in Crafton, Pennsylvania to produce household gas valves. In 1913, The Sterling Specialty Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was established and a brass facility was built at Newcomerstown, Ohio In 1931, the company was renamed as The Sterling Faucet Company. The company specialized in the production of faucets. The company also provided services of chrome and nickel plating for auto parts and for doctor's and dentist's instruments. On October 1, 1936 the company requested a federal court to declare them insolvent and grant permission to reorganize under the U.S. Bankruptcy laws. On March 16, 1939 a fire destroyed the Sterling Faucet facility of Newcomerstown, Ohio. After the fire was extinguished, it was unclear whether or not the facility would be reconstructed. The company had approximately 80 employees at the moment of the fire. =Mid-20th century= On April 9, 1940, it was announced the Sterling Faucet Company will be moved to Morgantown, West Virginia. On June 12, 1940 it was reported the Sterling Faucet Company completed the transference of its assets to the former Sabraton Works facility of the American Sheet and Tin Plate Company. On October 20, 1944, Sterling Faucet Co. announced plans for a considerable expansion of the plant. On September 13, 1948, the company Sa-Mor Quality Brass, Inc. was established in Morgantown, West Virginia. In 1952, Sterling Faucet Company organized three corporations at Reedsville, West Virginia: Pittsburgh Valve Company, Sterling Manufacturing Company and Hardware Brass Manufacturing Company. By 1953 the three corporations in Reedsville had 62 employees. On July 9, 1953, Sterling Faucet Company incorporated Sa-Mor Quality Brass, Inc. as a new subsidiary with the name of Sterling Tubular Products. In 1953, the plant of Sterling Tubular Products had 87 workers while the plant of Sterling Faucet Company had 571 workers. On December 24, 1958, Sterling President, J. Wesley Ruby, announced the purchase of a Glauber of Texas, Inc. which was a brass manufacturing plant located in Tyler, Texas with 115 employees. In the same press release, it was informed that two more plants, one in Ohio and one in Massachusetts will be integrated with five the company operates in West Virginia On August 1961, the Canada Sterling subsidiary, Sterling Faucet Canada Ltd bought from United Carr Fastener Canada Ltd a plant in Oakville, Ontario, Canada with the purpose of establishing a facility for the manufacturing of plumbing brass products. The company planned to employ 50 workers during the first year. On August 1962, the Reynolds Gas Regulator Company (subsidiary of Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company) announced the construction of a gas regulator and meter facility in Sheridan, Arkansas. One year later (on August 1963) while the plant was under construction, Arkla Industries Inc. sold the plant to Rockwell Manufacturing Co. The plant later will be transformed into a faucet manufacturing facility. By 1967, Sterling Faucet Co. reached US$28 million in sales. Sterling Faucet Company operated plants in Reedsville, West Virginia, Tyler, Texas, and Oakville, Ontario, Canada employing about 2,000 workers. On November 18, 1968, Rockwell Manufacturing Co. agreed to purchase Sterling Faucet Co. and the three subsidiaries, Sterling Manufacturing Co., Sterling Tubular Products Inc. and Sterling Faucet Canada Ltd. When the purchase was complete, Sterling Faucet Company became a subsidiary of Rockwell for the following years. =Late 20th century= In 1973, Rockwell International Corp., renamed the Sterling Faucet division as the Building Components Division. Rockwell started manufacturing Faucets under the Rockwell brand. On January 10, 1974, the Building Components division of Rockwell International informed the closing of its plant in Tyler Texas citing duplication of production facilities. The plant had 150 employees at the time of the announcement. On November 7, 1977, Rockwell International Corp, informed it may sell the Building Components division since there were several prospective buyers. It was also announced it will close the plant of Reedsville, West Virginia merging it with the operations of the plant in Morgantown, West Virginia. After the closing of the Reedsville Plant, the operations of the division remained in the plants of Sheridan, Arkansas, and Morgantown, West Virginia. In 1978, William W. Boyd and David C. Wright bought the company to Rockwell International and renamed it as Sterling Faucet Company. The company was reformed as a privately held firm. in 1980, Sterling introduced to the market the Accent brand of faucets. On January 26, 1984, Kohler Co. announced the purchase of Sterling Faucet Co. Kohler officials mentioned the purchase will allow the company to enter in the economy end of the faucet market, expand its markets and broad the product lines. As part of the acquisition, the brass foundry and injection molding plant of Morgantown, West Virginia and the assembly and injection molding plant of Sheridan, Arkansas (were 700 and 250 workers were employed respectively) became part of Kohler. The Sterling and Accent brands were integrated into Kohler Kitchen & Bath family of products. After the acquisition, Kohler started expanding the offering of Sterling branded products adding in the following years, tube doors, shower doors, corner shower enclosures, bathing fixtures, vitreous china fixtures, and other bathroom accessories to the existing faucets line. On December 29, 1986, Sterling Faucet Co. announced the acquisition of Polar Stainless Products Inc. which owned a plant in Searcy, Arkansas since 1965 and employed 150 workers. The acquisition brought stainless steel sinks to the Sterling family of products. In 1987, Sterling Faucet Co. purchased the Bath Products Division and related patented technology of the then struggling company, Owens Corning. The purchase included a manufacturing plant in Huntsville, Alabama that was built in 1972. This purchase brought the Vikrell (a poly-resin/plastic and fiberglass compound) line of bathing fixtures to Sterling. On March 31, 1988, the company was renamed as Sterling Plumbing Group Inc. Sterling Plumbing Group focused in the manufacturing and marketing of a full line of plumbing products for the Hardware/Home Center, Plumbing and Hardware wholesale, Builder and Specialized OEM market channels. On November 16, 1988, Sterling bought Kinkead Industries (a subsidiary of USG Corporation) and its manufacturing plant in Union City, Tennessee. This purchase added folding shower doors, tub and shower enclosures to the Sterling family of products. From 1994 to 1996, the faucet operations at Morgantown, West Virginia were transferred to facilities in the cities of Sheridan and Malvern, Arkansas. At the same time, the corporate offices moved to Rolling Meadows, Illinois. On July 2, 1999, the company Sterling Plumbing Group Inc. was merged with Kohler Co. By the end of the year, the logos located in the facilities of the Sterling Plumbing Group were replaced by the Kohler logo. =21st century= On January 2003, in a press release, Sterling Plumbing announced the discontinuation of the entire faucet product line to focus in other group of plumbing products. Production of faucets continued in the different Kohler facilities under the Kohler brand. The discontinuation included the faucet lines Nova‚Ñ¢, Starflo‚Ñ¢, Gemini‚Ñ¢, Tribute‚Ñ¢, Eminence‚Ñ¢, Progression‚Ñ¢, bath/shower drains and accessories. On January 13, 2012, Kohler co. announced the faucet facility at Malvern Arkansas will be closed and the existing operations will be transferred to the facilities in Sheridan Arkansas and Kohler Wisconsin. In 2015, Sterling introduced a stainless steel kitchen Sink that included a pull- out kitchen sink faucet with soap dispenser. This brings back, in a limited way, a kitchen faucet to the current Sterling line of products, which did not occurred since 2004.

In the last decade, various lectures, study centers, conference sections, academic journals, and at least one monographic series has appeared with \\"Analytic Theology\\" in their title or description. The movement counts both philosophers and theologians in its ranks, but a growing number of theologians with philosophy training produce AT literature. Analytic theology is strongly related to the philosophy of religion, but it is wider in scope due to its willingness to engage topics not normally addressed in the philosophy of religion (such as the Eucharist, sin, salvation, and eschatology). Given the types of historical philosophy that have funded the analytic philosophy of religion, theologians are frequently involved in retrieval theology as they revisit, re-appropriate, and modify older Christian solutions to theological questions. Analytic theology has strong roots in the Anglo-American analytic philosophy of religion in the last quarter of the 20th century, as well as similarities at times to scholastic approaches to theology. However, the term analytic theology primarily refers to a resurgence of philosophical-theological work during the last 15 years by a community of scholars spreading outward from centers in the UK and the US. Defining analytic theology Historically and methodologically, AT is both a way of approaching theological works as well as a sociological or historical shift in academic theology. =Analytic theology defined as a theological method= Due to its similarities to philosophical theology and philosophy of religion, defining analytic theology has been a challenge. Systematic theologian William J. Abraham defines analytic theology as ‚Äúsystematic theology attuned to the deployment of the skills, resources, and virtues of analytic philosophy. It is the articulation of the central themes of Christian teaching illuminated by the best insights of analytic philosophy.‚ÄùWilliam J. Abraham, ‚ÄúSystematic Theology as Analytic Theology,‚Äù in Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology, ed. Oliver Crisp and Michael C. Rea (Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 54. Philosopher Michael Rea defines analytic theology as ‚Äúthe activity of approaching theological topics with the ambitions of an analytic philosopher and in a style that conforms to the prescriptions that are distinctive of analytic philosophical discourse. It will also involve, more or less, pursuing those topics in a way that engages the literature that is constitutive of the analytic, employing some of the technical jargon from that tradition, and so on. But, in the end, it is the style and the ambitions that are most central.‚ÄùMichael C. Rea, ‚ÄúIntroduction,‚Äù in Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology, ed. Oliver Crisp and Michael C. Rea (Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 7. Cambridge theologian Sarah Coakley, by contrast, warns that attempts to set down an essentialist definition for analytic theology (i.e. a club that some are in and some are not welcome in) will distract from the productive work resulting from the recent flourishing of AT.Sarah Coakley, ‚ÄúOn Why Analytic Theology Is Not a Club,‚Äù Journal of the American Academy of Religion 81, no. 3 (September 1, 2013): 604-605. More specifically, analytic theology can be understood in a narrow and wide sense. When understood more widely, analytic theology is a method to be applied in theological works. Like other methodological approaches to theology (e.g. historical theology, retrieval theology, post-liberal theology), analytic theology, in this view, is a way of doing theological work that is independent of one's theological commitments. In this wider sense, Muslims, Jews, and Christians could all apply the same analytic methods to their theological work. William Wood has called this the ‚Äúformal model‚Äù of analytic theology.William Wood, ‚ÄúTrajectories, Traditions, and Tools in Analytic Theology,‚Äù Journal of Analytic Theology 4 (2016): 255 By contrast, some are concerned that those participating in the analytic theology movement are doing more than just applying a particular method to their work. Given that most of its practitioners are Christians, they wonder if analytic theology is also a theological program (i.e. it is committed to forwarding a certain body of theological beliefs). This then would be the narrower sense of analytic theology. In contrast to the formal method above, Wood suggests we could call this wider sense the ‚Äúsubstantive model‚Äù of analytic theology. Here one does ‚Äútheology that draws on the tools and methods of analytic philosophy to advance a specific theological agenda, one that is, broadly speaking, associated with traditional Christian orthodoxy. On this conception, the central task of analytic theology would be to develop philosophically well- grounded accounts of traditional Christian doctrines like the Trinity, Christology, and the atonement.‚Äù Wood is correct that the majority of analytic theologians are Christians who write in support of a broadly conciliar Orthodoxy. However, until statements by Christian analytic theologians can be cited that reject non-Christian (or even unorthodox Christian) conclusions as falling outside the boundaries of analytic theology, the ‚Äúsubstantive model‚Äù may lack justification as a fair definition. Falling between these two poles may be a more moderate position. Oliver Crisp, one of the founders of the contemporary AT movement, comments that AT is indeed more than just a theological style of writing. It also involves work by theologians who hold that ‚Äúthere is some theological truth of the matter and that this truth of the matter can be ascertained and understood by human beings (theologians included!).‚Äù Such writers also hold to ‚Äúinstrumental use of reason.‚ÄùOliver Crisp, ‚ÄúOn Analytic Theology,‚Äù in Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology, ed. Oliver Crisp and Michael C. Rea (Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 35. Crisp's comment brings out a key attribute of analytic theology addressed below - a tendency towards theological realism. Whether one holds a wide, narrow, or moderate view of analytic theology, ‚Äúdoing‚Äù analytic theology does not require undergoing a religious experience, participating in a church, or holding to any confessional statement. This openness makes more sense in contrast to the idea of doctrine, which involves the clarification and advancement of the teachings of a particular church or Christian community. Characteristics of analytic theology As a way of doing theology, analytic theology can often be identified by at least two, but usually three features: First there is the analytic method itself. Second is the focus on theological topics, such as incarnation or resurrection. There is not a hard boundary between analytic theology and analytic philosophy of religion. However, as noted in the introduction, analytic theology tends to treat a wider range of theological topics than the philosophy of religion. Whereas the latter might limit its focus to the existence of God, the problem of evil, and a very minimal concept of God (i.e. omniscience, omnipotence, omnibenevolence). Analytic Theologians assume the existence of God and press well into the analysis of theological topics not often addressed by the philosophy of religion. The third feature that characterizes most analytic theology is an engagement with the wider analytic philosophical or theological literature for concepts that can be applied to answer theological questions. Very often these concepts are deployed in the process of solving questions or conceptual ‚Äúproblems‚Äù that accompany certain theological beliefs (e.g. the two natures of Christ, or the question of free will in heaven). This literary aspect may be as essential as the other two. For example, ideas such as speech-act theory or possible worlds semantics have been applied to theological questions involving divine revelation or foreknowledge. In other words, analytic theology involves not only theology was written about with a certain analytic style but an application of ideas found in the analytic philosophical literature. A Venn diagram showing topics covered by analytic theology The analytic method The most frequently mentioned characteristic of analytic theology is its broad methodological and thematic overlap with analytic philosophy. This is signaled by the shared term ‚Äúanalytic‚Äù in both phrases. An effort to sketch out, tentatively, some rhetorical features that characterised analytic philosophy was first made by philosopher Michael Rea in the introduction to the 2009 edited volume Analytic Theology.Oliver Crisp and Michael C. Rea, eds., Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology (Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press, 2009). The idea was that some of these ways of pursuing an analysis of topics are found to characterize analytic theology. Rae's five characteristics are: *P1. Write as if philosophical positions and conclusions can be adequately formulated in sentences that can be formalized and logically manipulated. *P2. Prioritize precision, clarity, and logical coherence. *P3 Avoid substantive (non-decorative) use of metaphor and other tropes whose semantic content outstrips their propositional content. *P4 Work as much as possible with well- understood primitive concepts, and concepts that can be analyzed in terms of those. *P5 Treat conceptual analysis (insofar as it is possible) as a source of evidence. (Rea's qualification of each of these principles as well as his discussion of disagreements over them should be consulted): Imagine, for example, that a theologian writes that Jesus's cry of dereliction from the cross indicates that the Trinity was broken or ruptured mysteriously during Jesus' crucifixion. First, in terms of differentiating AT from the philosophy of religion, this is not something likely to be addressed in the philosophy of religion. An analytic theologian might ask for what ‚Äúbroken‚Äù denotes given its connotations when used about the God of Christianity. Is the original writer merely using rhetorical flair or are they trying to imply an actual ontological change in God? The analytic theologian, given her penchant for theory building, might list out the implications for other Christian doctrines depending on what meaning is intended by the word ‚Äúbroken.‚Äù The analytic theologian might turn to the history of theology, philosophically careful theologians, in search of concepts that help her speak about Christ being ‚Äúforsaken‚Äù by God without doing so in a way that unnecessarily risks contradicting an orthodox understanding of the Trinity.See, for example, Thomas H. McCall, Forsaken: The Trinity and the Cross, and Why It Matters (Downers Grove, Ill: IVP Academic, 2012). Analytic writers are willing to agree with others that many things about God easily outstrip our conceptual abilities. Mystery or apophatic is not incompatible with Analytic Theology. However the latter is more likely than others to press back when such concepts are used in a way that seems unnecessarily incoherent or risks contradicting other doctrines. =Analytic theology defined sociologically and historically= Andrew Chignell has offered a different definition of analytic theology. ‚ÄúAnalytic theology is a newly concerted, and well-funded effort on the part of philosophers of religion, theologians and religion scholars to re- engage and learn from one another instead of allowing historical institutional and stylistic barriers to keep them apart.‚ÄùAndrew Chignell, ‚ÄúThe Two (or Three) Cultures of Analytic Theology: A Roundtable,‚Äù Journal of the American Academy of Religion 81, no. 3 (September 1, 2013): 570. This definition is seen as significant because in some senses analytic theology is not substantially different methodologically than philosophical theology work done in the 1980s and 1990s. For example, [Thomas V. Morris's] books The Logic of God Incarnate (1986) and Our Idea of God (1991) exemplify the method and style of those working in analytic theology, but predates the current trend by twenty years. From this perspective, what characterizes analytic theology is sociological as much as methodological. In addition to its stylistic features, analytic theology is a reconciliation between philosophers, theologians, and biblical studies scholars that were less present before the mid-2000s. Chignell mentions at least two edited volumes that attempted to bring together philosophers, theologians and scholars of religion to work on questions they had in common.See Eleonore Stump and Thomas P. Flint, eds., University of Notre Dame Studies in the Philosophy of Religion, vol. 7, \\"Hermes and Athena: Biblical Exegesis and Philosophical Theology\\" (Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1993). See also, William J. Wainwright, ed., Reflection and Theory in the Study of Religion, vol. 11, \\"God, Philosophy, and Academic Culture: a Discussion between Scholars in the AAR and the APA\\" (Atlanta, Ga.: Scholars Press, 1996). It is difficult to say why the analytic theology movement did not gain momentum prior to Crisp and Rea's efforts between 2004 and the 2009 publication of Analytic Theology. In their respective fields, Crisp and Rea both witnessed a lack of eagerness for interdisciplinary interaction between philosophy and theology.Michael Rea, ‚ÄúAnalytic Theology: Precis,‚Äù Journal of the American Academy of Religion 81, no. 3 (September 1, 2013): 573. One possibility for the delay is that more time was needed (in the mid-1990s) before works by Richard Swinburne, Thomas Flint, Nicholas Wolterstorff, Eleonore Stump, Alvin Plantinga, and others made room in the theological academy for a movement like analytic theology. An alternative, and significant factor, is the role the John Templeton Foundation played in funding projects connected with analytic theology. It is not inconsequential that the John Templeton Foundation has helped to fund analytic theology-type projects on three continents, including North America, at the University of Notre Dame's Center for Philosophy of Religion; in Europe, at the Munich School of Philosophy and University of Innsbruck; and, in the Middle East, at the Shalem Center and then later the Herzl Institute in Jerusalem. More recent Templeton-funded initiatives include a three-year project at Fuller Theological Seminary in California and the establishment of Logos Institute for Analytic and Exegetical Theology at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland.‚ÄùJoshua R. Farris and James M. Arcadi, ‚ÄúIntroduction to the Topical Issue ‚ÄòAnalytic Perspectives on Method and Authority in Theology,‚Äô‚Äù Open Theology 3, no. 1 (November 27, 2017), 630. Whatever the link between the rise of AT and funding might be, it is unlikely that funding alone accounts for the flourishing in work that has appeared in the last decade. It certainly has nothing to do with the rich precursors to the AT movement in the 1980‚Äôs and 1990‚Äôs. For this reason, understanding the 20th-century shifts in Anglo- American philosophy is important to understanding the appearance of analytic theology. The history of analytic theology Historically demarcating movements (e.g. the Early Modern period of European history) is always imperfect. Many intellectual movements rise and fall like a bell curve rather than appearing suddenly as with clear boundaries. Analytic theology is no different. It should be thought of as the result of a wave cresting and not the result of a few contemporary individuals. Those currently working analytic theology derive their momentum from previous scholarship. Figure 2 Contemporary analytic theology, represented by scholars like Oliver Crisp and Michael Rea, has its roots in three periods of Western philosophical history. These are indicated by the three ‚Äúrising tide‚Äù levels in Figure 2. These periods include: (a) historic Scholastic philosophical theology (b) Mid 20th century responses by Christian philosophers to challenges of religious epistemology and religious language about God (c) a turn by Christian philosophers to work on more traditionally theological topics in the 1980s. As noted above, analytic theology is a contemporary movement. It is a resurgence in philosophical-theology that began in the UK and the US. However, this movement has always had a strong retrieval element to it. Retrieval theology refers to thinkers revisiting and reappropriating certain ideas from historical theology or philosophy. In analytic theology, this retrieval often includes a revisitation to the works of theologian-philosophers like Augustine, Duns Scotus, Anselm, Thomas Aquinas, and Jonathan Edwards. How then did a contemporary movement wind up with roots in a period of the Western intellectual tradition that is hundreds of years old? In Medieval Europe, a rich tradition of philosophical thought about theological topics flourished for over a thousand years. This tradition of philosophical theology was brought into steep decline by the philosophy of Immanuel Kant and the theology of Friedrich Schleiermacher.See Nicholas Wolterstorff, ‚ÄúIs It Possible and Desirable for Theologians to Recover from Kant?,‚Äù Modern Theology 14, no. 1 (January 1998). In the 20th-century, logical positivism stands as the low water-mark of philosophical theology with its denial of the very possibility to talk meaningfully about God at all. As a result, a very robust dividing wall separated philosophy and theology by the middle of the 20th century. (See Figure 2). The story of analytic theology usually begins at this point with Logical Positivism. In August 1929, a group of philosophers in Vienna sometimes referred to as the Vienna Circle, published a manifesto containing a verificationist criterion to be used as a criterion by which statements could be analyzed in terms of meaning. Any statements that could not be broken down into empirically verifiable concepts were held to be meaningless thus preventing any metaphysical (i.e. theological) dialogue as counting as meaningful. In the middle of the 20th century this verification principle began to crumble under the weight of its strictness on at least four counts: (a) No satisfactory concept of empirical verifiability could be agreed upon; (b) Supporters of logical positivism like Carl Hempel argued that it seemed to invalidate less strictly worded universal generalizations of science; (c) Ordinary language philosophers argued that it rendered meaningless imperatives, interrogatives, and other performative utterances.Georg Gasser, ‚ÄúToward Analytic Theology: An Itinerary,‚Äù Scientia et Fides 3, no. 2 (November 4, 2015): 27. (d) Furthermore, the verification principle itself was not empirically verifiable by its own standards. By the 1950s logical positivism was in decline and with it the stance that metaphysical claims were meaningless. The conversation shifted to grounds that required speakers to show why theological or philosophical claims were true or false. This had a liberating effect on analytic philosophy.Gasser, ‚ÄúToward Analytic Theology,‚Äù 31. According to Nicholas Wolterstorff, the demise of Logical Positivism also had the effect of throwing doubt over other attempts, such as those of Kant or the Logical Positivists, to point out a deep epistemological boundary between the knowable and unknowable, the thinkable and unthinkable. This put a crack in the wall that had divided theology and philosophy for centuries. Wolterstorff states that one result of the demise of logical positivism ‚Äúhas proved to be that the theme of limits on the thinkable and the assertible has lost virtually all interest for philosophers in the analytic tradition. Of course, analytic philosophers do still on occasion charge people with failing to think a genuine thought or make a genuine judgment. But the tacit assumption has come to be that such claims will always have to be defended on an individual, ad hoc, basis; deep skepticism reigns among analytic philosophers concerning all grand proposals for demarcating the thinkable from the unthinkable, the assertible from the non-assertible.‚ÄùNicholas Wolterstorff, ‚ÄúHow Philosophical Theology Became Possible within the Analytic Tradition of Philosophy,‚Äù in Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology, ed. Oliver Crisp and Michael C. Rea (Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 157. Wolterstorff also suggests that classical- foundationalism collapsed as the de facto theory of epistemology in philosophy, but it was not replaced by an alternative theory. What has resulted was an environment of dialogical pluralism where no major epistemological framework (e.g. classical foundationalism or idealism) is widely held.Wolterstorff, ‚ÄúHow Philosophical Theology Became Possible,‚Äù 159-161. In this context of dialogical pluralism, the state of play returned to one in which metaphysical or theistic belief could be taken as rational provided one could give justification for those beliefs. Two mechanisms for doing this became popular: Reformed Epistemology (See. Alvin Plantinga & Nicholas Wolterstorff) and evidentialist approaches that made use of Bayesian probability (See. Richard Swinburne). Either way, logical argumentation, and rational coherence remained important for such beliefs.Gasser, ‚ÄúToward Analytic Theology‚Äù, 44. In addition to arguments for rational belief in God, Christian philosophers also began to give arguments for the rationality of various aspects of belief within a theistic worldview. Examples here would be the coherence of certain traditional attributes of God or the possibility that the existence of God was not logically incompatible with the existence of evil in the world). In 1978, the [Society of Christian Philosophers] was formed. Six years later Alvin Plantinga delivered his famous presidential addresses ‚ÄúAdvice to Christian Philosophers‚Äù in which he signaled the need for Christians working in that field to do more than follow the assumptions and approaches to philosophy accepted in the wider field, given that many of those assumptions were antithetical to Christianity. He goes on to write that In the 1980s and 1990s Christian philosophers did begin to turn much of their efforts to explicating questions unique to Christian theology, thereby setting the precedent for the type of work done in analytic theology. The decades saw the production of more literature by Christian philosophers treating theological topics such as the attributes of God the atonement by scholars like[Richard Swinburne. However, much of that work remained largely appreciated by Christian philosophers and less so by Christian theologians. As noted in the analytic theology Defined as a Movement section, both Oliver Crisp and Michael Rea found that philosophers and theologians were not interacting and sharing resources as late as the mid-2000s. It was in the mid-2000s at Notre Dame that they floated the idea of an edited volume aimed at bringing philosophers and theologians together to work on theological questions with a methodology tuned to the style and resources of analytic philosophy. It was with the publication of this volume that AT began to garner attention, both positive and negative, in philosophical and theological circles. In 2012, a session at the American Academy of Religion was dedicated to discussing the volume, followed by several articles in volume 81 the AAR journal. In 2013 the Journal of analytic theology was begun, which is now in its sixth year. In 2015, Thomas McCall, professor of Theology at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School published An Invitation to Analytic Christian Theology with IVP. The following year at the 2016 Evangelical Theological Society annual conference a series of papers were given interacting with McCall's book to a packed room. By the close of the second decade of the 21st-century, several multiple-year projects have been funded at graduate-level institutions that focus on Analytic Theology. Edited volumes, such as those in the Oxford Studies in analytic theology series, continue to be released. Several dissertations have now been published, like monographs, that treat theological topics in an Analytic Style, and both the AAR and ETS continue to have regular sections devoted to papers on Analytic Theology. Analytic theology compared to other disciplines In a 2013 volume of the Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Andrew Chignell notes that some of the reviewers and writers in the 2009 analytic theology edited volume wondered what the difference, if any, was between analytic theology and philosophical theology.Andrew Chignell, ‚ÄúThe Two (or Three) Cultures of Analytic Theology: A Roundtable,‚Äù Journal of the American Academy of Religion 81, no. 3 (September 1, 2013): 569‚Äì570. Chignell's definition brings out an important question. Similarly one might ask what the difference between analytic theology and the Analytic Philosophy of Religion is.Max Baker-Hytch, ‚ÄúAnalytic Theology and Analytic Philosophy of Religion: What‚Äôs the Difference?,‚Äù Journal of Analytic Theology 4 (May 2016): 347. Demarcating boundaries between disciplines can be difficult. This is no different from analytic theology. Therefore, suggestions will be disputed. However, here are a few distinctions. * Analytic theology versus philosophical theology. The difference between Analytic Theology and philosophical theology is largely sociological or historic. Analytic theology just is philosophical theology applied by theologians with philosophical methods and sensitivities. In time, as analytic theologians listen to the calls by Biblical Theologians to be more sensitive to exegetical issues, there might develop a slight difference between even philosophical theology and analytic theology. * Analytic theology versus the philosophy of religion. The difference between Analytic Theology and the philosophy of religion, is more of a difference in scope. Given that AT grew out of Anglo-American philosophy of religion, they share much of the same history up until the 1990s. However, Analytic Theology is willing to treat topics of Christian theology that one will not see addressed in the philosophy of religion. Furthermore, analytic theologians are not focused on proving the existence of God. Instead, they will begin with God's existence, and the deliverances of their particular Christian tradition, and work on theological questions with the tools of analytic philosophy. Andrew Chignell suggests something like this in writing: * Analytic theology versus systematic theology. The difference between analytic theology and systematic theology is a third question that has been raised. Michael Rea's introduction in the 2009 analytic theology volume has not been received well by some theologians. Analytic Theology has thus been challenged as legitimately theology. Some suspect it is no more than philosophy in theological costume. William Abraham argues that analytic theology is systematic theology and that it was only a matter of time before something like analytic theology took root in the theological world.William J. Abraham, ‚ÄúSystematic Theology as Analytic Theology,‚Äù in Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology, ed. Oliver Crisp and Michael C. Rea (Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 54‚Äì69. Oliver Crisp has published an article demonstrating how analytic theology could qualify itself as systematic theology. Crisp cites leading theologians to demonstrate that there is no agreed-upon definition for systematic theology. He then shows how analytic theology shares a common task and goals with systematic theology and rises above a conceptual threshold established by the way various theologians view systematic theology.Oliver D. Crisp, ‚ÄúAnalytic Theology as Systematic Theology,‚Äù Open Theology 3, no. 1 (January 26, 2017): 156‚Äì166. In a 2017 interview, Oliver Crisp suggests that analytic theology is not attempting to take over the work of theology, but is instead suggesting an additional set of resources that theologians could turn to find help in their theological projects.See https://www.closertotruth.com/episodes/what-analytic-theology Analytic theology thus sits at the boundaries between several disciplines as suggested by Figure 3. Figure 3 Motivations for analytic theology Why would students and scholars want to do theological work in an analytic style? At least three motivations exist: # _A motivation to find possible solutions to theological challenges._ The history of theology has demonstrated that times of disagreement during the church's history have produced advances in theological clarity and depth. Theological disagreements force parties to be clear about their terminology, thought processes, and values. Disagreement also motivates thinkers to look for new solutions to prior conceptual problems. During the 20th-century, challenges to Christian theology by many thinkers like Anthony Flew, William Rowe, and John Hick provoked responses by philosophers like Basil Mitchell, Alvin Plantinga, and Thomas Morris which proved to be valued by many Christian theologians. By way of example, Christians have held for centuries that God answers petitionary prayer. More than one philosopher has offers a strong argument for the incompatibility of answered prayer and divine foreknowledge. It is easy to see a strong desire for a solution to the puzzle. Analytic theology, thanks to its careful way of proceeding and its access to philosophical concepts, offers conceptual tools to work out explanations to solutions, rather than just asserting that answered prayer is possible (e.g. rather than merely citing Bible passages like James 5:15-18). # _A motivation to consider theological topics and challenges from a fresh perspective._ Some theological words (e.g. love, judgment) are widely used without reflection because they are part of everyday language. However, clarifying what words like ‚Äúlove‚Äù refer to (rather than mistaking the effects of love for the meaning of ‚Äúlove‚Äù ) can bring a fresh perspective to old discussions. Christians might know for example that God loves us and that the evidence of love is patience and kindness. If love is defined as a desire for the good of the beloved and union with the beloved (and insight from Thomas Aquinas) new vistas of thought open up. One suddenly has criteria by which to identify patient actions that are genuinely loving patient and kind acts that are driven by other motives. # _A motivation to reap the benefits of clearer thinking in theological writing._ When responding to conceptual challenges, writers sometimes offer ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù that, in hindsight, turn out to be new terms that do little more than renaming the problem or put a new label on an old solution. The clear and careful thinking, prized by analytic theologians, can alert others to these dead ends by calling writers to clarify the meanings masked by new terminology, or to demonstrate the difference between new terms and already existing ‚Äúsolutions.‚Äù Criticisms of analytic theology Some of the following concerns have been voiced over analytic theology. First, ‚ÄúWhy do analytic theologians have such conservative theological views?‚Äù In other words, is AT just a theological project? Second, ‚ÄúWhy do analytic theologians ignore historical-critical biblical studies?‚Äù The worry here is also stated as, \\"Analytic Theologians seem to treat the Bible as a sourcebook for propositions to insert into logical arguments.\\" Thirdly, similar to the second worry, \\"Does AT genuinely engage Biblical narrative?\\" Fourth, \\"Is Analytic Theology genuinely theology or is it just philosophy dressed in theological clothing?\\" Practitioners & examples of analytic theology One of the best ways to become acquainted with a style of work or a movement is to become acquainted with works that are considered to be good examples of that style. As noted in the article above, before the mid-2000s most of the scholars doing something like analytic theology were Christian philosophers working on their own projects. =Practitioners= Given its dual citizenship in theology and philosophy, nothing prevents philosophers, with theological skills, or theologians, with philosophical training, from doing analytic theology. One should expect the scholar's particular strengths, theology versus philosophy, to take the leading role in their writing. Some of the best work resourced by analytic theologians have been done by philosophers, including nearly all of the past presidents of the Society of Christian Philosophers. Although artificial, an attempt to list out some leading lights in terms of ‚Äúgenerations‚Äù * 1st Generation (Writers who released their first works in the 1960-70s.) Basil Mitchell, Nicholas Wolterstorff, George Mavrodes, Alvin Plantinga, Richard Swinburne * 2nd Generation (Writers who released their first works in the 1980s.) Plantinga/Wolterstorff/Swinburne again, William Hasker, Thomas Flint, Linda Zagzebski, Eleonore Stump, Thomas Morris, James P. Moreland, William J. Abraham * 3rd Generation (Writers who released works in the 1990s and 2000s) Oliver Crisp, Michael Rea, Thomas McCall, Trent Doughtery, Brian Leftow, Sarah Coakley, etc.. * 4th Generation (Writers who released works in the last decade) Tim Pawl, Jonathan C Rutledge, Joshua Cockayne, Joshua Farris, JT Turner, James Arcadi, Jordan Wessling, Aku Visala, R.T. Mullins, Kevin Hector, RC Kunst, etc.... =Examples= The literature representative of analytic theology is growing rapidly. A few examples include: Analytic Theology: New Essays in the Philosophy of Theology (2009) edited by Oliver Crisp and Michael Rea; Analytic Theology: A Bibliography (2012) by William Abraham, An Invitation to Analytic Christian Theology (2015) by Thomas H. McCall; the Journal of Analytic Theology, the TheoLogica journal. Interested scholars should consult the growing series of titles under the Oxford Studies in Analytic Theology. There are nine titles in the series as of 2018.See https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/o/oxford-studies-in- analytic-theology-osat/ The PBS series Closer to Truth, released an episode on analytic theology in 2018. Finally, as noted in the sections on the history of analytic theology, there is a much wider body of literature published between 1970 and the 2009 release of the analytic theology that represents the kind of work analytic theologians value and use in their more recent works. Geography of analytic theology Given the above history, it is not unreasonable to suggest that analytic theology had its birth in an Anglo- American world of analytic philosophy. This is in contrast to the German idealist context of much early 20th-century theology (e.g. Karl Barth, Karl Rahner). Since the publication of the 2009 analytic theology volume, and with the help of several Templeton grants, analytic theology is being done in the UK, US, Germany, and Israel. Individual scholars who would count themselves as Analytic Theologians, or supporters of AT, can be found at institutions in the following countries or regions: Spain, Israel, Brazil, France, the UK, Austria, Scandinavia, and North America. Currently, there are several centers of study where analytic theology is being actively worked on in a departmental setting. These include: Fuller Theological Seminary, the Logos Institute at St. Andrews University, the Center for Philosophy of Religion at Notre Dame University, Oriel College at Oxford and the University of Innsbruck.See Innsbruck: www.uibk.ac.at/analytic-theology/; Fuller Seminary: analytictheology.fuller.edu; St. Andrews: logos.wp.st-Andrews.ac.uk; and Notre Dame: philreligion.nd.edu/research-initiatives/analytic-theology.

It belonged to the original cluster of factories which were set up in the Milo-Grogan area of the city, including manufacturer Kilbourne and Jacobs. During this period, Ohio's economy transformed from agricultural to industrial, making the state one of the largest coal-producing and consuming states in the US. Manufacturers in the region stimulated the transformation by producing high volumes of railroad and mining equipment and farming machinery. According to the COSI Center of Science and Industry, the Jeffrey Manufacturing Company played a significant role in the success of the coal mine. The Jeffrey Manufacturing Co. began as the Lechner Mining Machine Company in 1877, and was purchased by Joseph Andrews Jeffrey in 1888. The company's primary market was the coal mine industry, and it began business on a four-acre site. By the late 1940s, the site had grown to 48-acres, including 40 buildings. Also in 1888, the company became the first American locomotive manufacturer to build an electric locomotive for underground coal mines. It then developed and manufactured a coal crusher, and later conveyors for effective transport of coal through mines. Jeffrey Manufacturing was non-union until 1953. However, founder J.A. Jeffrey founded one of the first industrial infirmaries in the nation in 1889, as well as established a cooperative store, an employee cafeteria, and a program which assisted employees in buying homes. As the company grew, it acquired a number of other companies in the area, including the Ohio Malleable Iron Company in 1904, the Diamond Coal Cutter Company in 1926, and Galion Iron Works in 1942.

It was founded in 2014 by Michael Haft and Harrison Suarez, both former Marines. The company currently has twelve existing locations in Washington, D.C. and Virginia, including one active roasting facility. Compass serves hot and cold drinks, whole bean and ground coffee, espresso, latte, bagged and loose-leaf teas. Compass is in the process of constructing a roasting facility in the Ivy City neighborhood of Washington, D.C. to support its East Coast operations.  History  First Location of Compass Coffee in Shaw, Washington, DC Haft and Suarez, both native Washingtonians, decided to start a company together following their return to the city after leaving active duty in the Marine Corps. After writing the book, Perfect Coffee at Home, they settled on starting a coffee roasting company. In Haft's basement, the two experimented with coffee-roasting apparatuses and finally opened their flagship caf√© July 2014 in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington. This location also houses the company's main roaster and production center as well as offices. Following the first location, Compass built another caf√© in the same neighborhood, opening in September 2015. Over the next few years, Compass would open 10 more locations with their most recent located in the Ballston Quarter of Arlington, Virginia. Compass supports local DC-based businesses by stocking their products in cafes. To do this, the company works closely with Union Kitchen, a food accelerator in DC, that helps them source DC-made food items for its caf√©s.  Community Relations  = Made In DC = Compass Coffee has deep ties with its Washington community. Compass played a role in jumpstarting the Made in DC movement in 2017, a non-profit with the purpose of building a stronger DC food ecosystem and creating jobs. Made in DC is also involved in the partnership between Compass Coffee and Union Kitchen, allowing the promotion of DC-based companies in various ways. = Black Lives Matter 2020 = In lieu of the Black Lives Matter protests of the summer of 2020, Compass came under fire for their relations with Washington DC natives, their Black customers, and their homeless customers. Former employees and customers took to social media to express their distaste for Compass's discriminatory behavior. The company posted a photo and surveillance video of a cafe that had been looted during the height of Black Lives Matter protests. The captions of these posts claimed support for Black Lives Matter but not of perceived violent acts within the movement. According to several social media users, the company began deleting comments that criticized their actions on these posts. Compass deleted these posts and issued an public apology. Commenters continued to express their varying opinions about the company's actions. Some commenters explained their criticisms for the coffee shop: \\"I‚Äôm a regular at Compass on 7th in Shaw. I‚Äôve been disappointed recently to notice you charge a dollar for ice, only allow bathrooms for patrons even during the protest, and will kick community members off of your benches outside,\\" while others urged that the owners are not racist, but merely \\"surround themselves with other white men and women that look like them.\\" Many customers also took the opportunity to support Compass in saying, \\"it sounds like you are an innocent victim,\\" and reassuring their right to be upset in their particular social media post. Following Compass Coffee's June 3rd, 2020 post that reads, \\"We can do better. We will do better. And we are here to listen and learn,\\" nothing public has been released about Compass Coffee's community relations initiatives. = Promoting Voter Participation = Compass Coffee is the only independent coffee company partnering with the nonprofit, Power the Polls. The company used its 8 open cafes to serve as voter registration locations on National Voter Registration Day, September 22nd, 2020 and will work with Power the Polls to offer healthy, low-COVID-risk employees paid time off to volunteer as a poll-worker on Election Day 2020. The company has also received resources from the Civic Alliance, a non-partisan coalition of nearly 250 employees with the aim of increasing voter turnout.  COVID-19 Updates  In mid-March 2020, Compass Coffee decided to lay off 180 of its 200 employees abruptly with no monetary support under the promise that employees would be rehired when business picks up again from the coronavirus-related slowdown. Compass initially closed 6 of its 12 cafes. They reopened two locations in August 2020, so 8 of 12 original locations are fully functioning. In late March 2020, Compass Coffee began a partnership with DC Mayor Muriel Bowser under which the company was commissioned to aid in producing 2,000 gallons of hand sanitizer for DC government workers and emergency / first-aid responders in light of the COVID-19 pandemic in Washington, D.C.  Awards & Recognition  In 2015, Compass was praised by President Barack Obama as the coffee voted to be served in the White House during his Veterans Day Commemoration Speech On October 20, 2017, Compass Coffee founders Haft and Suarez received the District of Columbia Chamber of Commerce's Community Impact Award at the 2017 Chamber's Choice Gala.  Roasting Process & Equipment  The Compass roasting process is the first to use NASA technology for consistent brewing. It involves a Proportional Integral Derivative controller, which was developed by NASA to automate manual tasks and standardize operating procedures.

The name comes from the work he did for Jean Rolin II, who was the cardinal-bishop of Autun. His work is part of the increase in specialized book production seen in Paris as a response to the growing commissions from lay people and the University of Paris. From 1445 to 1465 he worked in Paris together with other anonymous artists on books that included the Book of Hours of Simon de Varie. Spencer published an account of his style in 1963.

The film stars Vincent Elbaz as a chauvinist who ends up in a parallel universe where stereotypical gender roles are reversed. The film was released worldwide on April 13, 2018, by Netflix. It is the second French-language Netflix original film (after Blockbuster) and the first French-language film commissioned by Netflix. Synopsis Damien is a shameless chauvinist who has all the benefits of living in a patriarchal society. After a bump to the head, Damien passes out. When he wakes up, he finds himself in what seems to be an alternate universe where gender roles are reversed and women have the power. Damien feels confused now that he experiences sexism struggles to find his place in this foreign new world. He meets and seduce Alexandra, a chauvinist herself, and influential novelist in this female-dominated world. Cast * Vincent Elbaz as Damien * Marie-Sophie Ferdane as Alexandra * Pierre B√©n√©zit as Christophe * Blanche Gardin as Sybille * C√©line Menville as Lolo * Christele Tual as Annie * Moon Dailly as Alexandra's coach * Camille Landru-Girardet as Ludovic Production The film finds its origins in Oppressed Majority (French: Majorit√© opprim√©e) a 2010 short film directed by Pourriat, about a stay-at- home dad who experiences sexism in a parallel, female-dominated world, and eventually becomes the victim of sexual assault. In 2014, after being released on video-sharing platform YouTube with English-language subtitles, the short garnered international attention and Pourriat was approached by Netflix to develop a new, larger project on the initial premise. Pourriat initially wanted to make a series, but, with the help of her producers, Eleonore Dailly and Edouard de Lachomette, she and Netflix eventually agreed to produce a feature-length romantic comedy. The film premiered on Netflix on April 13, 2018. In accordance with French laws on digital film distribution, the film was not scheduled for theatrical release in France, in order to be immediately available online. Pierre B√©n√©zit, the lead actor of Oppressed Majority, played as supporting character Christophe in I Am Not an Easy Man.

The national dances evoke imagery of combat and courtship. They play a role in efforts to preserve Circassian tradition and culture in the diaspora. There are several dances including the kabardinka. The version of this dance performed in Turkey is called Kafkas, from Kafkasya, the Turkish word for the Caucasus mountain region that was home to the Circassian people before the Circassian genocide. Another similar dance is called the lezginka. Dancing ability is very important for social standing in Circassian communities, especially with regards to marriage and establishing romantic relationships. Children living in the Adyghe communities in Israel receive dance instruction from a young age as part of their school curriculum. Circassian dances share some common traits with ballet: men dance on the tips of their toes wearing special leather boots. Women move very lightly, gliding across the floor without moving their heads or upper bodies. Circassian men wear a black outfit called a cherkes on stage. It is a military style outfit with an imposing coat and bullet cartridges worn across the chest. Men often wear a dagger, and a dagger or sword may be incorporated into some of the dances. Circassian dances are often performed at national festivals and cultural celebrations.
