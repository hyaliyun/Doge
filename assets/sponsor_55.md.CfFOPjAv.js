This project heralded Mathis's return to the genre of traditional pop, which he would revisit occasionally over the next few decades. The album peaked at number 46 during an eight-week run on the UK album chart that began on December 13 of that year and received Silver certification from the British Phonographic Industry for sales of 60,000 units in the UK. It also spent two weeks on Billboard magazine's Top Pop Albums chart in January 1987 and made it to number 197.. History In 1983 a renewed interest in pop songs dating back to the era before rock and roll became apparent when the album What's New by Linda Ronstadt received Platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America just three months after its release.RIAA Gold and Platinum Search for titles by Linda Ronstadt The recording focused exclusively on standards from the Great American Songbook and was arranged and conducted by Nelson Riddle.(1983) What's New by Linda Ronstadt [album jacket]. Los Angeles: Asylum Records 60260. The Broadway Album, a 1985 release of show tunes by Barbra Streisand, provided more evidence that there was an audience for what would be eventually referred to as traditional pop albums when it attained double Platinum certification only two months after its releaseRIAA Gold and Platinum Search for titles by Barbra Streisand and spent three weeks as the number one album in the US.. As The Broadway Album did for Streisand, The Hollywood Musicals brought Mathis back into familiar territory. He had spent the first 10 years of his recording career sticking with easy listening fare, but his 1966 LP The Shadow of Your Smile included covers of two songs by The Beatles (\\"Michelle\\" and \\"Yesterday\\")(1966) The Shadow of Your Smile by Johnny Mathis [album jacket]. Chicago: Mercury Records SR 61073. and became his first album to reach the top 10 since 1960's The Rhythms and Ballads of Broadway and the first to receive Gold certification since 1959's Faithfully. Contemporary music became a Mathis album mainstay from that point on, but many of his releases from the 1970s made room for one or two classics such as \\"Since I Fell for You\\",(1972) The First Time Ever (I Saw Your Face) by Johnny Mathis [album jacket]. New York: Columbia Records PC 31342. \\"Stardust\\",(1975) Feelings by Johnny Mathis [album jacket].

New York: Columbia Records PC 34872. and \\"That Old Black Magic\\".(1979) Mathis Magic by Johnny Mathis [album jacket]. New York: Columbia Records JC 36216. By the mid-80s, however, his studio albums were focused more on original material, so much so that his 1985 effort, Right from the Heart, left out not only anything reminiscent of those early pop hits but also any covers of recent radio favorites as well. Whereas that album failed to chart in either the US or the UK, his 1983 UK concert album Unforgettable ‚Äì A Musical Tribute to Nat King Cole was his best-selling disc, in terms of British Phonographic Industry standards, since That's What Friends Are For, his 1978 pairing with Deniece Williams. Even though this success was on a much smaller scale than was available from the US buying public, the sales phenomena that was also enjoyed by both Ronstadt and Streisand in the US only underscored the interest in material that was in such sharp contrast to his recent output.

She was instrumental in advocating for women's entry into the Chemical Society, and was best known for her dedication to advancing women's equality in the field of chemistry. She is identified as one of the Royal Society of Chemistry's 175 Faces of Chemistry.  Biography  Whiteley was born on 11 November 1866, in Chelsea, London, England, to her father, William Sedgewick Whiteley and mother, Hannah Bargh. Her mother died in the 1870s, after which her father remarried Mary Bargh Turner Clark in 1880.  Education  Whiteley began her education at Kensington High School, London, a Girls Public Day School Trust school. The Girls' Public Day School Trust provided affordable day school education for girls. She continued her education as one of first 28 students at Royal Holloway College for Women (London), where she graduated in 1890 with a B.Sc. in chemistry from the University of London. She remained at the Royal Holloway College for Women to obtain and pass an honor in an undergraduate degree in mathematical moderations from University of Oxford. Between 1891 and 1900 she was science mistress at Wimbledon High School and for the next 2 years, science lecturer at St. Gabriel's Training College, Camberwall. During 1898‚Äì1902 she was also undertaking research on the organic chemistry of barbiturate compounds at the Royal College of Science. Whiteley's research, working with Professor Sir William Tilden, helped her achieve earning a doctorate degree (D.Sc.) in 1902 from the Royal College of Science (later part of Imperial College),. Her dissertation was on the preparation and properties of amides and oximes. At the same time, she worked part-time as a science lecturer at St Gabriel's Training College in Camberwell, a college for female teachers.  University career  After completion of her doctorate in 1902, she was invited by Tilden to join the staff at the College of Science, and was one of only two female professional staff when the college merged with the newly formed Imperial College in 1907. She was the first woman to become a Reader in Imperial College. In 1912, Whiteley founded the Imperial College Women's Association upon recommendation from rector Sir Alfred Keogh. This association helped women of the college strive for equal treatment in the field of chemistry. Whiteley retired from Imperial College in 1934, but continued work in editing and contributing to Thorpe's Dictionary of Applied Chemistry with her co- author Jocelyn Field Thorpe. After Jocelyn Field Thorpe died in 1939, Whiteley became the principal editor of twelve volumes of the fourth edition of Thorpe's Dictionary of Applied Chemistry. She completed her contributions at the age of 88 in 1954. Whiteley's life and works are described in a detailed chapter in the 2011 publication on European Women in Chemistry.  War work  During World War One, the chemical laboratories at the Imperial College were utilized to analyze samples collected from battlefields and areas that had been bombed. She and her colleagues focused on analyzing lachrymators and irritants. Whiteley worked with Frances Micklethwait and 6 other female scientists in an experimental trench at Imperial College testing mustard gas and explosives. The work was hazardous: Whitely wounded her arm whilst testing mustard gas on herself. She also worked on developing syntheses of drugs that had previously been imported from Germany including beta-Eucaine, Phenacetin and Procaine. In 1920, Whiteley received the honor of the Order of British Empire for her scientific contributions to war efforts. An earlier biography by Mary R.S. Creese of the University of Kansas was published in 1997 in the American Chemical Society's Bulletin for the History of Chemistry, and references what appears to be an obituary published 40 years previously in the year after Whiteley's death.  Contributions to women in science  Whiteley was well known for her contributions to working towards women's equality in the field of chemistry. Prior to establishing the Imperial College Women's Association in 1912, Whiteley fought for cloakroom facility updates for female staff and students in all academic departments. Further, in 1904, she advocated with 19 other women for women's admittance into the Fellowship of the Chemical Society in London. At first the women were unsuccessful in their efforts, but in 1908 current fellows voted in favor of admitting women into the Chemical Society. However, the women did not gain full admittance into the fellowship until 1920 after the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act of 1919 was passed. After joining the society, Whiteley worked with another woman, Ida Smedley Maclean, in founding the Women's Dining Club of the Chemical Society. Whiteley became the first female elected member of the Chemical Society's Council.

Their debut album Abominator was released in 2013 through Monsterman Records, Doyle's own label.  History  After having formed his own band Gorgeous Frankenstein in 2007 and releasing an eponymous album on Glenn Danzig's record label Evilive, Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein had to deal with many lineup changes that finally led him to start over with a new project. In agreement with Alex Story (the last vocalist of Gorgeous Frankenstein),) Doyle's new project was eponymously named \\"Doyle\\". Along with these two founding members, the group's first lineup included drummer Dr. Chud (ex-Misfits, Michale Graves era) and bassist 'Left Hand' Graham, (ex-Graves and Gorgeous Frankenstein) In 2014, Dr. Chud left the band shortly before Doyle's first \\"Annihilate America Tour\\" and was replaced by Anthony \\"Tiny\\" Biuso (former drummer of T.S.O.L., The Dickies and Hed (pe)) in August. Shortly after, \\"Tiny\\" stated that he would no longer be playing with the band, and would not continue on the remainder of the tour. He was replaced by drummer Brandon Pertzborn (Black Flag 2014-2016) just before hitting the road for the \\"Abominator Tour 2015\\" in March. In March and April 2015, the band toured as an opening act (with Dope) for Mushroomhead, with headlining dates continuing after into May. During this tour, bassist 'Left Hand' Graham was replaced by DieTrich Thrall. The current bassist is Brandon Strate (who also plays with They Live). The \\"Abominator Tour 2015\\" was dubbed the \\"Mad Monster tour\\" from September through October 2015 with special guest guitarist John 5 (Rob Zombie, ex-Marilyn Manson) who joined Doyle for a number of dates. For certain shows, the tour also featured the Family Ruin, Hatchet and Calabrese. Doyle announced an upcoming album entitled As We Die for May 2017. In February 2017, the \\"Abominate the World Tour\\" was launched in Europe (\\"Abominator UK/European Invasion Tour\\") in support of the album Abominator.  Abominator (2013)  In 2013, Doyle's debut album, Abominator was first released digitally through INgrooves/Fontana on July 30. It was available on iTunes, Google Play, Deezer and others. The album is distributed by Altavoz (USA), Nippon Columbia (Japan) and Cargo Records (Europe). It was independently produced and released by Doyle's own Monsterman Records and officially released on CD in October 2013. An \\"advance copy\\" was sold at the concerts on the \\"Danzig Legacy Tour\\", as well as from Doyle's official website. This pre-released \\"advance\\" album is lacking a 13th track, released on the final cut, entitled \\"Drawing Down The Moon\\" The tour scheduled in support of the album had to be delayed since Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein was touring that year with Danzig. In 2014, the band had to cancel their tour with Gwar after the death of lead vocalist Dave Brockie. The lyrics of Abominator were written by Alex Story and all the music and arrangements are written by Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein,. The bass tracks for the album were played by Doyle himself = Performing style and musical instruments = 260px When performing live, both Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein and Alex Story look like monsters from a vintage horror movie. Doyle remains faithful to his usual \\"Frankenstein's monster\\" look and make-up, wearing his classic Misfits devilock hairstyle, armbands with the band's skull logo (instead of the Misfits \\"Crimson Ghost\\") and a custom guitar strap with the inscription \\"Beast Mode\\" on the left shoulder. As Alex Story describes it: > When he puts that [stage makeup] on, that's like warpaint or something. It's > like he's going into battle. He literally transforms himself. [...] He just > seem[s] like an animal, like a monster. In the same way, Story (aka \\"The Wolfman\\") wears large sideburns and he often disguises himself as a werewolf inspired by the 1940s movie The Wolf Man.

He had his only formal education at Ansar-un-deen Primary School, Oke popo, Lagos. He is the owner and founder of Eleganza group of companies, which has a market spanning Western Africa. Early life Razak Okoya is a Yoruba man from the south-western part of Nigeria. He was born to the family of Tiamiyu Ayinde Okoya in Lagos, the then capital. He worked in his father's tailoring business, which also included the sale of tailoring accessories. The experience he got gave him the confidence to start tailoring activities on his own. He saved every penny he made until he had 20 pounds. His mother gave him the extra 50 pounds, and with the blessing of his father, he started importing and trading goods from Japan. Business career Razak Okoya's business expanded swiftly, he travelled far and wide and learnt how things were manufactured having the strong feeling that Nigeria could match that quality if not better. His first wife, Kuburat Okoya, was obsessed with costly jewellery and he was always baffled at how much she said they cost. He strongly felt the prices were outrageous since the metals could be designed at a cheaper price and the metals were readily available in Nigeria. Challenged his perceived healthy demand, he travelled abroad, bought the machines. That marked the birth of Eleganza Jewelry. The success was phenomenal. They could not keep up with the demand because, the products were beautiful, durable and cheap. They were instant best sellers. He also started manufacturing buttons and jewellery. He began the importation of shoes in large quantities, subsequently. On one of these occasions, the shoes were not delivered despite his payment. He travelled to Italy to see the manufacturer only to discover that they had used his money to settle their bills. He was so angry that he decided there and then to start manufacturing his own shoes. He imported all the machines and brought in some experts who trained his workers. Today, under his Chairmanship, the Eleganza Industries produces a wide range of household goods and utensils including cutlery, collieries, food warmers, ice chest, electric fan, cosmetics and ballpoint pen. His factory locations include, Oregun-Ikeja, Isolo, Alaba and Iganmu, the Company now directly employs over five thousand Nigerians and non-Nigerians including those working in his RAO Property Investment Company.

According to Bellanaija, \\"the music video [for \\"Suddenly\\"] was shot on location at Chief Razak Okoya's 'Oluwa Ni shola' Estate. Quotes \\"In school, I could see my teacher in worn and often shabby clothes and at the same time, I could see the well-dressed businessmen of Dosunmu Street, the heart of business in Lagos then. It was easy for me to choose business life.\\" \\" I keep to myself. I do not look at other people. I am content with myself. I do not look for cheap money. I am not interested in contracts and I do not expose myself to intrigues and politics.\\" \\"You do not do business for the ego value. You go for what the people can afford.

The Day of Saci is commemorated on the same day as the American holiday, October 31st. It was designed as a celebration of Brazil's culture and folklore, but few Brazilians commemorate it, even with official support in S√£o Paulo state and a few municipalities.Dia do Saci faz 'resist√™ncia pac√≠fica' ao Halloween para preservar mitos nacionais. Bol, 31 de outubro de 2011.  History  Halloween celebrations in Brazil started in English schools, where it was an important celebration. The real push towards the popularization of the festivity was given by industry later. In the last week of October in Brazil, many stores are decorated with pumpkins and dark colors and adorned with Halloween products ‚Äì most imported from China or Taiwan. Trying to oppose the American influence on Brazilian culture, deemed a distraction from its rich heritage, the NGO Amigos do Saci established Saci Day. The initiative was strongly supported by artists, educators, politicians and a good portion of society, and was turned into an official date in S√£o Paulo state (Law n¬∫ 11.669, January 13th 2004), as well as ten municipalities: S√£o Paulo, S√£o Luiz do Paraitinga, S√£o Jos√© do Rio Preto, Guaratinguet√° and Embu das Artes (S√£o Paulo); Vit√≥ria (Esp√≠rito Santo); Po√ßos de Caldas and Uberaba (Minas Gerais); and Fortaleza and Independ√™ncia (Cear√°).  Saci  The Saci, also called Saci-perer√™, is the best known character of Brazilian folklore. It originated as a Guaran√≠ legend in the Jesuit reductions of southern Brazil. In some regions, the Saci appears as an evil being, in others, as a playful and graceful creature. In northern Brazil, African influence transformed the Saci into a little black boy who is always smoking a pito (a kind of pipe) and has lost one of his legs in a Capoeira fight.

A member of the Paris Opera Ballet from 1967, she received the status of principal dancer in 1982. After retiring from the stage in 1996, she continued to accept invitations until 2010. From 2001 to 2008, she was artistic director at the √âcole sup√©rieure de danse de Cannes Rosella Hightower. Early life and education Born in Choisy-le-Roi, a suburb of Paris, Loudi√®res had enjoyed music from an early age but it was her doctor who recommended she should take up ballet, given her rather fragile constitution. After studying for five years at the Paris Opera Ballet School (1967‚Äì1972), she was admitted to the Paris Opera at the age of 16. Career When she was 19, she danced her first solos in L'Oiseau bleu, Michel Fokine's Le Spectre de la Rose and Paul Taylor's Aureole. Between the age of 13 to 26, Loudi√®res was mentored by Yves Brieux who gave her an understanding of theater, stage, and the idea of projection. George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins helped her develop musicality as well as her breathing technique. After she had danced Kitri in Rudolf Nureyev's Don Quixote, the artistic director Rosella Hightower elevated her to √©toile in 1982. She went on to dance the roles of dramatic heroines in Giselle, Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev) and Onegin. She also danced roles in the ballets of contemporary choreographers including Balanchine, Maurice B√©jart, and John Neumeier. She has also worked with Alvin Ailey, Mats Ek, William Forsythe, Martha Graham, Ji≈ô√≠ Kyli√°n, Serge Lifar, Kenneth MacMillan, Roland Petit, Paul Taylor, and Twyla Tharp. She created roles in ballets choreographed by Nureyev: Black and Blue, Washington Square and La Dansomanie. Loudi√®re danced as a guest around the globe in performances of the Boston Ballet, Tokyo Ballet, La Scala, The Royal Ballet, Stuttgart Ballet, Teatro Col√≥n and at the Havana Ballet Festival. In 1993, she was awarded the Grand Prix National de la Danse and was decorated in 1996 as a Commandeur des Arts et Lettres. Retirement After retiring from the stage in 1996, she continued to accept invitations until 2010. She has sought balance between work and family life, being married with two children.

His ‚ÄûIntrinsic Photography\\" (Remmes about his work) is contrary to the New Objectivity of the D√ºsseldorf School of Photography founded by Bernd and Hilla Becher. He captures multiple dimensions of theater reality by including diverse temporal, spatial, contextual and reality layers in one image. His pictures tell stories of the theatre machinery. He shows the backgrounds and unwritten laws, the union of scientific and superstitious components behind the scenes. Remmes writes small notes and poems with light to show different realities: the world outside and the artificial world on stage, when actors and singers swap from one world to the other. He represents modern theatre photography but he‚Äôs not interested in personality cult or in documentation of the action on stage. He uses unusual prospects, i.e. bird's eye view. The photographs carry emotion in a different way, by blurred and strong contrasted sujets. Remmes manages to bring the sensitive balance between theatrical work and art to perceptibility.

It was initially launched in 2001 and was nominated for a Webby Award in the Religion & Spirituality category in 2003. The site was redesigned and relaunched in 2005. It seeks to \\"increase the number of rituals available for holidays, Shabbat and traditional lifecycle events. Approach Ritualwell aims to \\"promote a democratic Judaism where everyone is welcome to submit content and join the conversation.\\" Earlier prayer and ritual were committed to paper and published in books. Ritualwell seeks to leverage the fluid, changing and democratic nature of the internet. While its roots are in the feminist movement, Ritualwell attempts to be broadly inclusive while also seeking to make contemporary feminist Jewish liturgy and rituals widely available. The name Ritualwell references a Jewish story of endless water available in the desert. The midrash of Miriam's well \\"is a rabbinic legend that tells of a miraculous well that accompanied the Israelites during their 40 years in the desert at the Exodus from Egypt\\". Though Miriam is closely associated with Jewish feminism, Ritualwell tries to \\"expand the use of ritual in daily life, to sanctify all life changes for men, women and children.\\" The story of Miram's well is linked to a late 20th century feminist addition to the traditional seder plate; some seders (including the original Women's Seder, but not limited to women-only seders) now set out a cup for the prophet Miriam as well as the traditional cup for the prophet Elijah, sometimes accompanied by a ritual to honor Miriam.Miriam's Cup: Miriam's Cup rituals for the family Passover seder. Miriamscup.com. Retrieved on 18 October 2011. Miriam's cup originated in the 1980s in a Boston Rosh Chodesh group; it was invented by Stephanie Loo, who filled it with mayim hayim (living waters) and used it in a feminist ceremony of guided meditation. =Traditional rituals= Ritualwell includes information on traditional Jewish rituals such as attending the mikvah, Counting the Omer, and marrying. It offers a variety of new approaches to traditional rituals such as marriage (with rituals for same sex weddings and second marriages), baby naming, and the Passover seder. Rituals are reshaped by people who want Judaism in their lives but don't feel comfortable with some aspect of the traditional ritual. Current Ritualwell editor Rabbi Roni Handler explains \\"Even if they do not have a regular spiritual practice, couples view their wedding as a microcosm of the home they are creating together... [they] aren't looking at marriage as a business transaction as it was once understood... They want the [ritual] to represent their commitment to each other.\\" Since traditional Jewish weddings include a large number of different rituals, Ritualwell includes betrothal blessings, tisches, and other elements of the wedding. =New rituals= The site offers newly created rituals to mark various points in contemporary life such as a child beginning kindergarten, getting a driver's license or leaving for college. Other new rituals include retiring from work, suffering a miscarriage, surviving cancer, and the separation of a marriage. Informing contemporary ritual Since its founding in 2001 Ritualwell has regularly been cited as a source for material on Jewish ritual practice. Books, websites and blogs all refer to Ritualwell and recommend it as a resource. =Books= *Open it Up!: Integrating the Arts Into Jewish Education (2006) cites Ritualwell as a source for inspiration for Passover projects. *The Women's Seder Sourcebook: Rituals and Readings for Use at the Passover Seder (2006) discusses Ritualwell as a source for seder rituals and ideas. *Celebrating the Jewish Year: The Fall Holidays: Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot (2007) refers to Ritualwell in discussion of Rosh Hashanah and Simchat Torah. *Teaching the Holocaust (2007) references Ritualwell as a resource for creating a Yom HaShoah service for students. *Women Remaking American Judaism (2007) discusses the orange on the seder plate and cites Ritualwell as a source for \\"new ritual.\\" *The Torah commentary book Torah Queeries (2009) includes a chapter on each of the 54 weekly Torah portions. The chapter on Parashat Lech Lecha (Genesis 12:1-17:27) refers to two different rituals from Ritualwell while discussing transformation and covenants. *The Creative Jewish Wedding Book (2009) repeatedly mentions Ritualwell as a source for material to use when planning a Jewish wedding. *Inventing Jewish Ritual (2010) calls Ritualwell one of \\"two trustworthy Web sites\\" for learning about new Jewish rituals and refers to the site throughout the book as a source for material. *Bioethics in a Cultural Context: Philosophy, Religion, History, Politics (2011) cites Ritualwell in a discussion of the Jewish position on Assisted reproductive technologies (ART). *A Jew's Best Friend?: The Image of the Dog Throughout Jewish History (2013) mentions a \\"Blessing of the Animals\\" ritual found on Ritualwell. =Websites and blogs= The following is a sample of websites and blogs that reference Ritualwell. This list is not comprehensive. *Hillel, the largest Jewish campus organization in the world, advises students wishing to start a Rosh Chodesh group to rely on the \\"excellent discussion\\" in an article on Ritualwell. *Congregation Netivot Shalom recommends Ritualwell as a resource for people planning marriage and commitment ceremonies and b'nai mitzvah, people converting to Judaism, and for people grieving a loss. *Omerharvest, a website focused on the annual Counting the Omer recommends the \\"wealth of resources\\" on Ritualwell. *Rabbi Sarah Tasman discussed using a ritual from Ritualwell on her blog (2013). *The Jewish Baby Network cites Ritualwell as a resource on its \\"blessings and rituals\\" page. *Rabbi Margaret Frisch Klein references Ritualwell in posts about teaching children to pray, bat mitzvahs, and the power of ritual (2013). *The Jewish Women's Center of Pittsburgh recommends Ritualwell as a \\"website of value\\" to Jewish women. History and relationship to Jewish feminism Lori Lefkovitz and Eve Landau launched Ritualwell in 2001 with the purpose of making \\"contemporary feminist Jewish liturgy and rituals broadly accessible.\\" Lefkovitz was working in her role as the founding director of Kolot: Center for Jewish Women's and Gender Studies at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College (RRC) and Landau was director of Ma'yan, the Jewish Women's Project. Their organizations were resources for people interested in feminist and innovative Jewish ritual. Lefkovitz stated \\"history shows us that Jewish ritual and liturgical practices were once more fluid than they later became. It seems to me that the printing press froze our words and practices, and I am convinced the Internet is in the process of defrosting [them].\\" The site was nominated for a Webby award in the religion and ritual category in 2003. In 2005 Lefkovitz and Shapiro published a scholarly article in Nashim discussing the creation of Ritualwell and the difficulty of creating a site that was feminist while still being accessible to a broad spectrum of Jews (from unaffiliated to Orthodox). They \\"wanted to provide a resource equally valuable to a traditional rabbi in the big city and to a Jewish family remote from many Jewish resources\\" with a primary commitment to \\"sanctifying life occasions and holidays\\" through the lens of Judaism and egalitarianism. Issues they struggled with included: *The gendered nature of Hebrew and traditional Jewish prayer that \\"classically references both God and the normative Jew with masculine pronouns.\\" *The use of the word \\"feminist\\" appeared to discourage participation by \\"some of [their] targeted audience.\\" *The inclusion of rituals intended to mark milestones in the lives of boys and men because \\"parents who had created beautiful new ceremonies for their baby girls now needed to make the celebrations of their sons' births as meaningful as those for their daughters. *The question of whether new rituals \\"resonate[d] with Jewish tradition... utilize[d] Jewish symbols in ways appropriate to them... make use of traditional prayers or texts in innovative ways that remain[ed] true to their essence... [and felt] Jewish?\\" In 2005 RRC became the sole publisher of Ritualwell and launched a redesigned website. Rabbi Roni Handler, the current editor of Ritualwell.org, started in that role in 2007.

He was named after his grandfather Sigismund III, and uncle John Casimir. Biography He was raised by the governess Rozyna Ma≈Çgorzata von Eckenberg. As he was an only child, he was the almost certain candidate as the successor of Ladislaus IV. The French traveller, Le Laboureur described him as a child: extremely vivid, lean and agile. He was also seen as being quick-minded, he was a fast learner, and by the age of seven, he was fluent in not only Polish but German too, and made good progress in Latin. The prince willingly dressed in the Polish fashion, which still further strengthened his position as candidate and endeared him to the Poles themselves.

After five days of pain and bloody diarrhoea, the young prince died.

The first children's hospice in Russia. The St. Petersburg Children's Hospice has two facilities: one in the city park ‚ÄúKurakina Dacha‚Äù near the St. Petersburg River Station and another one in the village of Ol'gino. The Children's Hospice provides physical, psychological, emotional, social and spiritual care. The basic idea of the hospice care is to enable children with severe and incurable diseases and all members of the child's family to live a full life. History One of the wards of the round- the-clock care station The St. Petersburg Children's Hospice started its work in 2003 under the guidance of Archpriest Alexander Tkachenko. In 2010, the Children's Hospice became the first governmental institution providing pediatric palliative care in Russia. The first inpatient facility was opened in the ‚ÄúKurakina Dacha‚Äù building ‚Äì the former ‚ÄúNikolayevsky‚Äù orphanage. The second facility for children of the Leningrad Oblast (and other regions of Russia) was opened in the village of Ol'gino situated in the Resort District of St. Petersburg. In its early years, the Children's Hospice was a home-based service consisting of doctors, social workers, nurses and psychologists. The aim was to provide hospice outpatient care to terminally ill children and their families. The St. Petersburg Children's Hospice has become a model for the establishment of such institutions in the city of Moscow, the Moscow Oblast and other regions of Russia . The appearance of the inpatient facility in St. Petersburg was preceded by 7 years of work by hospice employees. On June 1, 2010, on its seventh birthday, the St. Petersburg Children's Hospice opened the doors of the inpatient facility \\"Magic House\\" for seriously ill children. When visiting the Children's Hospice on November 20, 2010, Kirill, the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, said: > ‚ÄúToday, on such a personal day for myself, I am happy to visit the hospice, > and believe me that perhaps the most beautiful gifts that I have been > presented today are faces of doctors, attendants, and parents testifying to > their courage and faith, and of course, the children who are going through > this suffering for reasons unknown to our human mind‚Äù. On November 21, 2011, Federal Law No 323 \\"On the Fundamentals of Health Protection in the Russian Federation\\" was passed, in which Article 36 \\"Palliative medical care\\" was added at the initiative of the St. Petersburg Children's Hospice. The Children's Hospice staff participated in the development of methodical guidelines for professionals and parents. In 2012-2013, under the auspices of the hospice, several palliative medical care services were opened in Leningrad and Moscow regions. In 2015, it is planned to complete the construction of a second inpatient facility of the St. Petersburg State Autonomous Healthcare Institution (SAHI) ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs Hospice‚Äù. In 2011, the Children's Hospice founder, Archpriest Alexander Tkachenko, received St Andrew the First-Called Foundation Award \\"For Faith and Loyalty\\". In March 2013, Archpriest Alexander Tkachenko and the Children's Hospice executive director Pavel Krupnik were awarded the Certificates of Honor by the Federation Council, the upper house of the Federal Assembly of Russia. On July 31, 2014, in the Kremlin, Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded Archpriest Alexander Tkachenko the governmental mark of distinction \\"For Beneficence\\".  Structure of the Children's Hospice  The St. Petersburg Children's Hospice is structured as follows: = Home-Based Service= The St. Petersburg Children's Hospice has run the home-based service since its very inception. The physicians, nurses, psychologists and social workers of the service regularly visit families in the care of the hospice and provide them with counseling, medical and psychological assistance. The service oversees about 300 children living in St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region. = Round-the-clock Care Station= thumb The station is designed for round-the-clock care for 20 patients and, in addition, for 10 patients from the daycare station. The length of stay depends on individual needs of a child and his family. The purpose of the care station is to stabilize and possibly improve the child's state of health, as well as to provide respite care for the family. The care station provides the children with all necessary medical and psychological rehabilitation opportunities. The interior of the entire inpatient facility is different from public children's hospitals. There are no wards with white walls. Instead, there are rooms decorated with drawings for children living together with their mothers. All the furnishings inside the hospice facility are designed to improve the child's emotional state. =Intensive Care Unit= thumb The Intensive Care Unit consists of wards with modern equipment and is designed for round-the- clock observation of children who have reached a terminal state. = Daycare Station = At the daycare station the children enjoy the same range of services as in the round-the-clock station, but they do not stay overnight.  Management  The St. Petersburg Children's Hospice Director is Russian Orthodox Church archpriest Alexander Tkachenko. He is also considered the main inspirer of establishing children's palliative care as a separate branch of the Russian healthcare system.  Financing According to data from 2013, the St. Petersburg city budget allocates to the St. Petersburg State Autonomous Healthcare Institution ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs Hospice‚Äù about 50 million rubles a year. The non-profit Medical Institution ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs Hospice‚Äù finances itself solely by donations.

Sprague de Camp Bibliography. San Francisco, Underwood/Miller, 1983, page 155. The story appeared under the pseudonym Lyman R. Lyon (the name of his maternal great-grandfather) as the magazine's policy did not allow the name of any author to be repeated on the same contents page, and de Camp had another piece in the same issue under his actual name (part one of his article \\"Design for Life\\").Index to Science Fiction Anthologies and Collections It first appeared in book form in the anthology Imagination Unlimited (Farrar Strauss and Young, 1952). It later appeared in the anthologies Men of Space and Time (The Bodley Head, 1953), and Science Fiction Inventions (Lancer Books, 1967), as well as the de Camp collection The Best of L. Sprague de Camp (Doubleday, 1978). It was credited to de Camp's real name in all publications subsequent to its first appearance. The story has been translated into German.  Plot summary  The story is set in a then-future era of the late 1950s, and is presented in the form of a letter from the protagonist, geologist Kenneth Staples, to a prospective employer, explaining why he desires to leave his present job. Staples has been working for paleontologist/inventor Gilmore Platt, whose stereoscopic prospecting device can locate and reveal buried fossils in full detail. From an archeological colleague, Dr. Wilhelmi of Zurich, Platt gets the idea of using an electrolytic bath to restore the specimens he has been retrieving to their original condition, just as the archaeologist can do with corroded bronzes whose atoms have partly dissipated into the surrounding soil. After much experimentation, the two men succeed in restoring complete animals, hair and all, from fossil skeletons and the matrices of rock in which they are embedded. First they reconstruct an extinct Canis dirus (dire wolf), reviving it by applying an electric starter to its heart. They repeat the process with an Arctotherium (short-faced bear), which they are unable to revive and is mounted in the American Museum of Natural History, Stenomylus hitchcocki (an ancestral camel), Trilophodon (a primitive proboscidean), and Dinocyon gidleyi (a bear-dog). They hire Elias, a former circus performer, to manage their growing collection, which they house in a concrete barn with a row of cages down one side. Staples has a close shave, when the Dinocyon escapes its cage in an attempt to prey on the Stenomylus and sees him as an adequate substitute. Platt and Elias come to his rescue, the former with a gun and the latter with a stick of dynamite. It takes the dynamite to do it. Platt then calmly revivifies the bear dog again, but incarcerates it in a stronger cage. It's later sold to the Philadelphia Zoo. It is replaced with a Dinohyus (a piglike animal the size of a buffalo). News of the sale attracts a Mr. Nively, representing the Marco Polo Company, a membership corporation consisting of the whole country's wild animal importers and dealers. His clients want to buy out Platt's discovery, as the resurrection of prehistoric creatures has the potential to ruin the market for present-day animals, which they control. After Platt rejects a number of offers Nively resorts to threats, and is kicked out. Meanwhile, Platt and Staples recreate their biggest animal yet, a specimen of Parelephas jeffersonii (Jeffersonian mammoth), which they name Tecumtha after the historical Shawnee chief. They also take on a new man, Jake, to assist Elias and help protect their menagerie against Nively. The precaution is well taken, but inadequate. Nively reappears early one morning and attempts to shoot Tecumtha. Enraged, the mammoth takes off after Nively, who tries to escape on Elias's bicycle. Staples, still in his pajamas, pursues both by truck. He eventually finds them in a nearby town square, with Nively perched atop an equestrian statue of General Sheridan while Tecumtha prowls about its base. When the mammoth pushes over the statue, Nively flees to a nearby tree. On Staples's advice, he then moves to the top of the truck cab to help lure Tecumtha up into the truck bed. With the animal secured, Staples extorts Nively's clothing from him and lets the villain go, only to get into a dispute with local police, who want to kill the creature as a dangerous wild animal. Rather than permit this, Staples drives off. After shaking pursuit he calls Platt, who tells him the police have their lab staked out against his return. Accordingly, Platt suggests he drive to Chicago and sell Tecumtha to the zoo there before returning. Unfortunately, Dr. Traphagen at the zoo assumes Staples a madman on hearing his story, particularly since he can't even confirm his own identity, the only identification he can produce being Nively's. Led away by the men in the white suits, he calls to Tecumtha, whose trumpeting finally convinces Traphagen of his veracity. The sale is completed, and Tecumtha is saved. Afterwards, Platt hires more guards and has his compound properly fenced. He begins to recreate more animals, including a Mastodon americanus for the Bronx Zoo in New York. He hires another paleontologist as an additional assistant and with him starts happily digging dinosaurs in Wyoming. Staples learns the two have found a complete Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton, and in light of his experiences so far decides it's time to \\"clear out while I'm still in one piece.\\" Relation to other works The plot feature of a disaffected businessman's designs on a recovered mammoth is echoed in de Camp's later Reginald Rivers time travel story \\"The Mislaid Mastodon\\" (1993).

It tells the story of Jonas Milk, a man whose Russian-Jewish parents, refugees from Archangel, brought him up in a little French town where he owns a bookshop. One day his promiscuous wife disappears, not for the first time, but this time she has taken his valuable stamp collection. As she fails to reappear, and first his neighbours and then the police become suspicious, his grip on his own life weakens. Plot summary Left in an unnamed town in Berry by his Jewish parents, who returned to Soviet Russia and oblivion, the timid Jonas Milk lives quietly above his second-hand bookshop and also deals in rare stamps. He feels at home amongst the other small businesses in the town, until he marries his maid, a much younger woman with a bad reputation and converts to Catholicism. She is neither a good housekeeper nor a faithful wife, and causes Milk considerable embarrassment and shame. Though she disappears with other men from time to time, she always returns soon after to Milk. However, one day when she has not come home and Milk, to spare himself yet more embarrassment, lies over her whereabouts. As the days pass, his lies are believed by fewer and fewer neighbours, who begin to shun him, and somebody informs the police. His anguish is increased by the fact that his most valuable stamps, which only she knew about, are gone from his safe. The police first call round for an allegedly informal chat and then call him in to the station for a formal interrogation, followed by an exhaustive search of his premises. They are suspicious because he has not reported a missing person and, like the rest of the town, wonder if her body is in the canal as an end to her overt infidelities. Milk's worries are initially eased when a hotel chambermaid tells him that his wife has gone off with a salesman whose room she shared whenever he visited the town. Innocent all along of any crime, he first thinks of going round to the police station but, no longer able to face the hostility of the community and the pressure of the police, instead hangs himself.

The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Description and history Benson's New Block and the Mohawk Chambers are located in downtown Greenfield. They stand side by side at the corner of Main and Wells Streets, facing Main Street. The righthand building, Benson's, is a three-story brick building built in 1916, and the left one is four stories, built in 1913. Both are built using steel frame construction, and are finished with Neoclassical brick and stone finishes. The Main Street facades have retail office spaces on the ground floor, with a cornice line separating that floor from the upper floors. The roofline of the Mohawk Chambers features a projecting cornice facing Main Street, which extends a short distance along the secondary Wells Street facade. Both buildings were built by Thomas J. Gass, and originally housed commercial businesses on the first floor and residential apartments and rooming house space above. Gass was a noted local builder who also participated in the restoration of nearby Historic Deerfield. The Mohawk Chambers building housed the offices of W. Edward Benson, one of the city's major real estate developers and land speculators of the period.

Summary Nussbaum analyzes the role that disgust plays in law and public debate in the United States.Nussbaum, Martha. Oxford University Press. \\"From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law\\" (2010) She primarily analyzes constitutional legal issues facing gay and lesbian Americans but also analyzes issues such as anti-miscegenation statutes, segregation, antisemitism and the caste system in India as part of her broader thesis regarding the \\"politics of disgust\\". She posits that the fundamental motivations of those advocating legal restrictions against gay and lesbian Americans is a \\"politics of disgust\\". These legal restrictions include blocking sexual orientation being protected under anti-discrimination laws, sodomy laws against consenting adults, constitutional bans against same-sex marriage, over-strict regulation of gay bathhouses, and bans on sex in public parks and public restrooms.For the last two, see Martha Nussbaum, From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law. Oxford University Press, 2010, 198-199. Nussbaum also argues that legal bans on polygamy and certain forms of incestuous (e.g. brother-sister) marriage partake of the politics of disgust and should be overturned.Nussbaum, From Disgust to Humanity, 154-155. Nussbaum identifies the \\"politics of disgust\\" closely with Lord Devlin and his famous opposition to the Wolfenden report that recommended decriminalizing private consensual homosexual acts on the basis that those things would \\"disgust the average man.\\" To Devlin, the mere fact some people or act may produce popular emotional reactions of disgust provides an appropriate guide for legislating. She also identifies the 'wisdom of repugnance' as advocated by Leon Kass as another \\"politics of disgust\\" school of thought as it claims that disgust \\"in crucial cases...repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it.\\" Nussbaum goes on to explicitly oppose the concept of a disgust-based morality as an appropriate guide for legislating. Nussbaum notes that popular disgust has been used throughout history as a justification for persecution. Drawing upon her earlier work on the relationship between disgust and shame, Nussbaum notes that at various times, racism, antisemitism, and sexism, have all been driven by popular revulsion. In place of this \\"politics of disgust,\\" Nussbaum argues for the harm principle from John Stuart Mill as the proper basis for limiting individual liberties. Nussbaum argues the harm principle, which supports the legal ideas of consent, the age of majority, and privacy, protects citizens while the \\"politics of disgust\\" is merely an unreliable emotional reaction with no inherent wisdom. Furthermore, Nussbaum argues this \\"politics of disgust\\" has denied and continues to deny citizens humanity and equality before the law on no rational grounds and causes palpable social harms to the groups affected. Reception From Disgust to Humanity earned acclaim in the United States,San Francisco Book Review \\"Why Has Divided America Taken Gay Rights Seriously?: A Philosopher Credits the Power of the Imagination\\"\\"Let's Be Rational about Sex\\" and prompted interviews in The New York Times and other magazines.\\"Gross National Politics\\"Back Talk: Martha Nussbaum One conservative magazine, The American Spectator, offered a dissenting view, writing, \\"[H]er account of the 'politics of disgust' lacks coherence, and 'the politics of humanity' betrays itself by not treating more sympathetically those opposed to the gay rights movement.\\" The article also argues that book is marred by factual errors and inconsistencies.\\"The Politics of Humanity\\" References Category:2010 non-fiction books Category:American non-fiction books Category:Books about the philosophy of sexuality Category:Books by Martha Nussbaum Category:Contemporary philosophical literature Category:English-language books Category:Oxford University Press books Category:Social philosophy literature ","title":"From Disgust to Humanity"},{"id":"42336222","text":"William Collier (born 11 December 1890 in Kirkcaldy) was a Scottish footballer, who played for Raith Rovers, Sheffield Wednesday, Kettering Town and Scotland.

The competition has no winner. Competition format =Old formats= Each canton FA organizes its own cup, held in Fall through early summer next year and each canton has two berths in the Federation Cup. That makes 20 teams. Then, 20 teams are drawn to make 10 matchups of the final, which are played over one leg in late August or early September. Winners (10) qualify to national cup. Big problem is lack of interest at both clubs and cantonal FAs so Federation Cup never had 20 teams - if there are no 20 teams, some teams, depending on draw, get bye to national cup. Competition has no winner although it only stage is called final. From the 2014‚Äì15 season, a new format was introduced. It was still 20 teams, but 16 spots were awarded to teams from the First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina while the remaining 4 spots were filled with teams from cantonal cups. =Current format= As there were changes in the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina number of teams in the 2016‚Äì17 season, this cup was supposed to qualify two more teams to the national cup. The new format was introduced. There were two rounds. In the First round 16 teams from lower leagues, still qualified through their respective Canton cup, would play each other, with winners qualifying to the Second round where then they were paired with 16 teams of the First League of FBiH.

He was active in the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria and Italy. Biography L√©on Gurekian, the son of Hovhannes Gurekian and Prapion Yeremian, was born in Constantinople on 26 April 1871. His Armenian family originated and resided in Trebizond and worked in business relations between the Middle East and Europe - especially Marseille. He studied first in Trebizond before and completed studies at the Mechitarist Armenian College of Venice in 1888. He then went to Rome where he graduated in 1895 both from the \\"Regio Istituto di Belle Arti di Roma\\" with the Diploma of Professor of architectural design and from the \\"Regia Scuola di Applicazione degli Ingegneri\\" with a degree in architecture. He married Mariamik Azarian in 1901, in Constantinople. Their only son Ohann√©s Gurekian was born in 1902 and was also architect. Career =Bulgaria= Shortly after returning to Constantinople in 1896, he managed to escape the pogroms of the Armenians Hamidian massacres by the Sultan Abdul Hamid II by taking refuge in Bulgaria. After getting his architecture degree recognized by the Bulgarian Government, he designed various buildings and won the contest to design the Municipal Professional Theatre in Varna which was later built with only slight modifications by Bulgarian architect Nikola Lazarov. =Constantinople= Returning to Constantinople in 1899, Gurekian designed numerous buildings in the town and on the islands of Prinkipo (Islands of Prince, B√ºy√ºkada). During his period he had contacts with the architects of the Balyan family, which family archive includes many original drawings and photos.Actually all the Balyan archive is kept at the Museum-Institute of the Architecture of Armenia in Yerevan (Armenia)Some of the drawings are published in: Pars Tuglaci, The role of the Balian family in Ottoman architecture, YCK, Istanbul 1990; Diana Barillari, Istanbul 1900, Florence 1996, Octavo, Franco Cantini Editore).Tigran Khzmalyan. Armenian Architects of Istanbul: Online Exhibition, 27 March 2015 During this period Gurekian was also intensely politically active, publishing under a pseudonym in Armenian newspapers. =Italy= On 7 September 1907, he moved suddenly and without apparent explanation to Rome. In 1908 he obtained from the Regio Istituto di Belle Arti di Roma in Rome, the Diploma of Professor of Architectural Design, on the basis of his studies there in architecture in 1895. In 1911 he designed and built the Ottoman Pavilion to the International Exhibition in Turin. This is one of the only works he designed in Italy, the others being the funeral chapel of a friend of his in Trieste and his home - Villa Ararat - in Asolo, Treviso. In September 1911 he was appointed representative of the Ottoman Government to the International Congress of architects in Rome, but while there the Italo- Turkish War arose and he participated as a regular member of the Association of Architects which was already part. Starting in 1911, and increasingly in subsequent years, he spent time in Asolo which is also the summer residence of the Armenian College in Venice. For several years from 1921 onwards he went in vacation in Frassen√© in the province of Belluno where the environment reminded him of Toz at Trebizond, where his family had a summer residence during his childhood. In 1912 he began a long project to survey important monuments of Byzantine and Romanesque Architecture in Ravenna, Aquileia, Istria, Dalmatia and especially in Brianza with the aim of studying the influence of Armenian Architecture on Romanesque Architecture. This was basically in opposition to the thesis of G.T. Rivoira.G.T. Rivoira, Le Origini della Architettura Lombarda, Milano 1908, Ulrico Hoepli editore From 19141918 the First World War forced him to stay in Asolo where he made a living as a photographer. In 1919 he went to Paris where he published a political analysis of World War I in the form of an animal allegory: \\"The Responsible\\".L√©on Gurekian, Le R√©sponsable, All√©gorie historique dans le R√©gne Animal, Paris 1919, Jouve & Cie Editeurs While there he also participated in political efforts towards the constitution of the Independent Republic of Armenia. In 1922, becoming bitterly aware of the impossibility of returning to what would be the Independent Armenian Republic given the failure of the Treaty of Versailles (1919), he decided to settle in Asolo and designed and built his home there. From that moment, he totally abandoned architecture. He published a series of political and philological studies, mostly in the Armenian language. In \\"Kars and Ardahan\\"L√©on Gurekian, ‘ø’°÷Ä’Ω ’•÷Ç ‘±÷Ä’ø’°’∞’°’∂ (Kars e Ardahan), Venezia 1949, Tipografia di S. Lazzaro degli Armeni he put forward the Armenian claim to those provinces, which were ceded to Turkey in the Treaty of Alexandropol. At the end of the Second World War a Delegation of the Soviet Armenian Republic went to Asolo to ask Gurekian if he was willing to move to Armenia. Being already sick he refused, but stated in support of that cause that: behind me there was always a photograph of General Antranik (Andranik Ozanian). He died in Asolo on 2 September 1950 and was buried in family grave.

Biography Elizabeth Sherman Hoyt and Sir Ronald Charles Lindsay married in 1924. He was appointed Ambassador to Turkey from 1924 to 1926 and to Germany from 1926 to 1928, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from 1928 to 1930 and Ambassador to the United States from 1930 to 1939. While in Washington D.C., Elizabeth Lindsay planted the gardens of the new Edwin Lutyens designed British Embassy which was the setting for the famous tea party for King George VI and his wife Queen Elizabeth, the first reigning monarchs from the United Kingdom to visit North America. =Early years= Lady Lindsay was born Elizabeth Sherman Hoyt, the daughter of the American financier and industrialist Colgate Hoyt (1849‚Äì1922); her mother, Lida Sherman, the daughter of Charles Taylor Sherman and niece of Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman and John Sherman, who served as both Secretary of State as well as United States Secretary of the Treasury.James, Olivia, editor. The letters of Elizabeth Sherman Lindsay, 1911-1954 New York: Privately Printed, 1960, p. vii. The family home was ‚ÄúEastover,‚Äù a 173-acre estate on Centre Island, New York in Long Island, New York. Hoyt's older and only siblings were Sherman, Ann and Colgate. Elizabeth Hoyt lived in Oyster Bay (town), New York with her brothers; Sherman became the first world-class American yachtsman.Hoyt, Sherman. Sherman Hoyt‚Äôs memoirs. New York: D. Van Nostrand Company, 1950, p. 8-12. The mother, Lida, died 15 September 1908 after which Elizabeth developed heart problems. She managed ‚ÄúEastover‚Äù until her father remarried, to Katherine Cheeseman. =Careers= Hoyt was educated at private schools in New York City. Beginning in 1909 for two seasons, determined to become a landscape architect at a time when formal training was not opened to women, Elizabeth Hoyt, studied botany and horticulture at the Arnold Arboretum in Massachusetts, under the supervision of the head, Charles Sprague Sargent. Her role model and mentor was Beatrix Jones, who later became Beatrix Farrand, the designer of the gardens of Dumbarton Oaks.Zaitzevsky, Cynthia. ‚ÄúA career in bud: Beatrix Jones Farrand‚Äôs education and early gardens.‚Äù Journal of the New England Garden History Society 1998, v. 6, p. 14. Hoyt worked for two years in Jones's New York office. In October 1914, after touring and studying gardens both in Europe and the United States, Hoyt set up her own business in New York, first at 171 Madison Avenue, later at 38 East 11th Street. Work was mostly small commissions on Long Island's Gold Coast, Long Island (the North Shore) of Long Island, the area of her upbringing, and in Cleveland, Ohio, where members of her family still lived.James, Olivia, editor.

She became an assistant to Martha Lincoln Draper at the headquarters of the American Red Cross. Draper and Hoyt were sent to France in July 1917 to undertake the standardization of hospital garment and dressings and to survey working conditions of women. By October 1917, upon returning to the Red Cross headquarters in Washington, Hoyt became head of the newly created United States Women's Bureau. Being the decisive executive, she soon dissolved as not being effective within the organization. While on assignments in France during the war, Hoyt developed close friendships with Robert Woods Bliss and Mildred Barnes Bliss, eventual creators of Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D.C. and site of Farrand's best known and still complete work. Hoyt became an executive on the staff of the wartime General Manager of the Red Cross, Harvey D. Gibson.James, Olivia, editor.

Henry Adams in love: the pursuit of Elizabeth Sherman Cameron. New York: Universe Books, 1983, p. 226, 260-266. At the Paris Red Cross Headquarters she was made a member of the Commission and Deputy Commissioner for France. After returning to America in the summer of 1919, Hoyt decided to give up her landscape gardening business. After working as an executive in a New York bank, followed by real estate ventures, there was campaign work in the presidential campaign of Republican Herbert Hoover for President.James, Olivia, editor. The letters of Elizabeth Sherman Lindsay, 1911-1954 New York: Privately Printed, 1960, p. 44-45. =Marriage= Hoyt married Ronald Charles Lindsay, the widower of her cousin, in the chapel of Stepleton House, at Blandford, Elizabeth Cameron's home in Dorset, England. There were no children from either of Sir Ronald's marriages. Sir Ronald had previously served twice in Washington: from 1905 to 1907 as Second Secretary under Sir Henry M. Durand, from 1920 to 1921 as Counselor of the Embassy under Viscount Grey of Fallodon and Sir Auckland Geddes. He was the fifth son of James Lindsay, 26th Earl of Crawford. =Washington Embassy= The Lindsays moved to Washington in March 1930 but did not move into the still incomplete new British Embassy complex, Ambassador's Residence and Chancellor, until June where she had a coronary thrombosis and was away seeking treatment and for the next year. Lindsay then undertook the planting of the Embassy's garden.James, Olivia, editor. The letters of Elizabeth Sherman Lindsay, 1911-1954 New York: Privately Printed, 1960, p. 175.

In New York for family business, Elizabeth Lindsay had planned to follow him but because of the declaration of war (World War II) and travel restrictions, furthered by her own poor health, she was not able to travel. She built a house for herself, called ‚ÄúLime House‚Äù on 46 acres of the old family estate, ‚ÄúEastover‚Äù having been torn down in 1930. From there Lindsay worked for various charities on behalf of the war effort. Lindsay's gardening life was recognized by having two plants named in her honor.

It is the second-oldest building on campus, constructed in 1909. It currently houses the University Club, a members-only institution open to faculty, staff and community members. History The building, designed by D. W. Millard and built by Harvey D. Patton, was constructed in 1909 as one of three original buildings that formed the first quad of the Territorial Normal School in Tempe. (Old Main is the only other building that survives today.) It was originally constructed to house the school's small science department as well as administrative functions. As the normal school grew, the building was soon modified. It was remodeled in 1935Thomas, Alfred. Arizona State University: A Documentary History of the First Seventy-Five Years. 1960. Vol. 4, Part X: 42. and again in 1950; the latter renovation coincided with the science department moving to a new Sciences Building (now known as Discovery Hall) and the conversion of \\"Old Science Hall\\" into the home of Arizona State College's English department. The 1950 addition, with Mel Ensign as architect, added a fire stair and restroom projection and was one of several alterations to the now-historic buildings on campus (around the same time, an expansion was made to Old Main). In the mid-1960s, the English department moved to its own new home: the Language and Literature Building, located across from the Old Science Building on the quad and at the corner of University Drive and College Avenue. Soon after, during the Vietnam War, ROTC programs moved in, and by the 1980s it was known as the \\"Fine Arts Annex\\" and housed some arts programs. In the summer of 1983, the School of Art was told that the structure, whose foundation had been damaged by rot and termites, was no longer suitable to be occupied; the building was slated for demolition.http://www.asu.edu/cfa/wwwcourses/art/SOACore/history.htm However, in the mid-1980s, several university buildings from the 1930s and earlier were listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Fine Arts Annex. After the building's designation as historic, renovations were made to remove the 1950 Ensign addition and restore the building to its original appearance. In 1989, the University Club was created as a members-only club for faculty, staff and parents of current ASU students. Architecture Science Hall is a two-story brick building measuring by , constructed on a granite foundation. While Science Hall is executed in the Queen Anne style with its scale, massing and steeply pitched roof, it also reflects how Classical Revival influences had been growing since the turn of the century, with denticulated cornices; an arcaded entry; and a pedimented Palladian dormer.

It is a solo performance, with Johnson singing and playing an acoustic slide guitar. The song was later popularized with recordings by artists such as Bob Dylan, Dave Van Ronk, Steve Miller, Dave Brock, Eric Clapton, Rosanne Cash, and Lucinda Williams. Johnson recorded the song during his first session for Columbia in Dallas, Texas, on December 3, 1927. The lyrics are autobiographical, since Johnson's mother died when he was young. His father remarried soon after her death, and later, the stepmother allegedly threw a caustic solution, which blinded the boy: \\"Motherless children have a hard time, mother's dead, Well don't have anywhere to go, Wandering 'round from door to door\\". Blues researcher Samuel Charters describes Johnson's slide guitar playing as having \\"a nuance and delicacy that extended and clarified the emotion of his singing\\", which is supported by his rhythmic fingerpicked bass line. Columbia issued the song on a 78 rpm record with the title \\"Mother's Children Have a Hard Time\\".

Early years Michel Pierre Alexis H√©bert was born in Granville, Manche, on 7 July 1799. He studied law, and was admitted to the bar of Rouen in 1820. He had some success as an advocate. After the July Revolution of 1830 he supported the new government and was rapidly promoted in the judiciary. He was appointed prosecutor at the court of Rouen in 1833. On 19 May 1834 he was made head of the royal court of Metz. Political career On 21 June 1834 H√©bert was elected deputy for the sixth college of Eure (Pont-Audemer). He sat with the conservative majority, and was soon a frequent speaker. He was involved in debates on tobacco, bankruptcies, assizes and secret ballots for jury decisions.

It is today a geographic township in the town of Halton Hills in the Regional Municipality of Halton. Territorial development The township of Esquesing was surveyed in 1818 and opened to settlement the following year. Its name was said to come from a First Nations word meaning \\"the land of the tall pine(s)\\", but is more likely to come from the Mississauga word ishkwessin, meaning \\"that which lies at the end\\",FREELANG Ojibwe-English and English-Ojibwe online dictionary which was the original name for Bronte Creek. The grid pattern of lines and sideroads that define the landscape of the township to this day, is often interrupted by the rugged cliffs of the Niagara Escarpment, the deep Credit River valley or the headwaters of Sixteen Mile Creek. It was this natural beauty that drew the Hurons first and then the Mississaugas to hunt, fish and live in this area. The Township was organized into a municipality, and its council held its meetings at Stewarttown. The principal road to Lake Ontario was Trafalgar Road so development of several settlements began along this route first. A more direct route to York was established by the York to Guelph Road, now Highway 7. In that era, these hamlets provided the essential services for pioneers and travelers. It was the arrival of the Railway in 1856 that changed the landscape and provided the stimulus for the urban development of Georgetown and Acton. Esquesing Township Council governed the remaining communities: :* Glen Williams, north of Georgetown on the Credit River. Many tourists visit the Williams Mill complex. However, the village was known for its woolen products from 1839 until 1982. :* Stewarttown, location of the township hall, became known by Lawson‚Äôs flour and saw mills. :* Norval on Highway 7 adjacent to Peel Region was famous across the Dominion of Canada for their fine flour produced from the mills in the village. :* Limehouse, between Acton and Georgetown, was known for its lime products burned from the limestone on which it was built. The lime kiln and mill ruins attract hikers through the village today.Rowe, John Mark Benbow, \\"Halton Hills, An Outline History\\" MS 25 Aug. 2004 :* Scotch Block, considered the most ethnically homogeneous region in the county, its first settlers \\"Scotch almost without exception\\". Municipal evolution The first township meeting was held in 1821 when the population was 424. Over the years, two parts of the Township were constituted as separate municipalities: :* Acton: incorporated as a village in 1874, and erected into a town in 1950. The Rev. Zenas and Ezra Adams were responsible for the founding of a village, first known as Adamsville before acquiring its present name in 1844. It was the leather industry that defined Acton from its earliest days. The Storey Glove factory was the largest employer for many years, but in the 20th century, the largest employer was the Beardmore Tannery. It became the largest tannery in the British Empire. :* Georgetown: incorporated as a village in 1864, and erected into a town in 1921. George Kennedy founded Georgetown with a flour mill and foundry. However, it was the Barber Brothers who put the village on the map. The railway prompted them to build a paper mill, becoming the largest employer. By the turn of the 20th century, Georgetown had three paper mills which earned it the name of \\"Papertown\\". About 100 years after Georgetown‚Äôs railway growth, came the idea of a model community built by Rex Heslop. The huge Delrex community sprawled south of old Georgetown. Finally, an even larger development began south of the Silver Creek Valley about 1989. That development, carried out by several builders continues to this day. On January 1, 1974, Halton County was reorganized to become the Regional Municipality of Halton. As a consequence, Esquesing (excepting a southwestern portion annexed to Town of Milton), Acton and Georgetown were amalgamated to form the new Town of Halton Hills.1973 Act, s. 2(1)(d) Organization of schools The Parliament of Upper Canada originally passed legislation in 1816 providing for each district of the Province to have a board of education, and for each common school to be governed by its own school trustees. Upon its settlement, Esquesing was eventually divided into school sections for each of its common schools (although their dates of establishment are uncertain): #Ligny #Quatre Bras #Ashgrove #Pinegrove #Waterloo #Stewarttown #Norval #Dublin #Gibraltar #Dufferin #Glen Williams #Lorne #Bannockburn #Blue Mountain #Clay Hill #Mount Pleasant #Milton Heights This system of governance would continue unchanged until the 1940s. Talks began in 1944 to amalgamate some of the school sections into a single school area board, and action was taken in 1945 to merge seven sections, and an eighth section came on board before the end of the year. Two more sections were included in 1947, and the remainder joined at dates as late as 1956, 1961 and 1962. The single board for the Township only lasted until an Act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1968 constituted the Halton County Board of Education,The Secondary Schools and Boards of Education Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 362, Part VI , as inserted by which came into being on January 1, 1969.

Under H.R. 1871, projections of such spending would still be based on the current year‚Äôs appropriations, but would not be adjusted for inflation going forward. Other adjustments to projections of future discretionary spending would also be eliminated. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background =Baseline budgeting= Baseline budgeting is an accounting method the United States Federal Government uses to develop a budget for future years. Baseline budgeting uses current spending levels as the \\"baseline\\" for establishing future funding requirements and assumes future budgets will equal the current budget times the inflation rate times the population growth rate.Statement of Paul N. Van de Water, Assistant Director for Budget Analysis Congressional Budget Office on Budget Projections and Baselines before the Task Force on Budget Process Committee on the Budget U.S. House of Representatives April 1, 1998, see \\"http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/3xx/doc393/040198.pdf\\" at http://www.cbo.gov/publication/10679 see page 5 Twice a year‚Äîgenerally in January and August‚ÄîCBO prepares baseline projections of federal revenues, outlays, and the surplus or deficit. Those projections are designed to show what would happen if current budgetary policies were continued as is‚Äîthat is, they serve as a benchmark for assessing possible changes in policy. They are not forecasts of actual budget outcomes, since the Congress will undoubtedly enact legislation that will change revenues and outlays. Similarly, they are not intended to represent the appropriate or desirable levels of federal taxes and spending.See Statement of Paul N. Van de Water cited above =Related legislation= This bill was introduced at the same time as the Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013 (H.R. 1874; 113th Congress) and the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress) as a package of budget reform bills. A similar bill was introduced during the 112th United States Congress and passed the House. Rep. Paul Ryan argued in favor of that bill, saying that \\"let's not err on the side of assuming every government agency automatically needs a spending increase one year to the next. If we think they need more money, then we should measure it on an honest basis and then legislate more money for those agencies.\\" Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Baseline Reform Act of 2013 would amend the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman- Hollings Act) to revise the formula for establishing the budget baseline. The bill would revise the annual baseline, for any fiscal year, to mean a projection of current-year levels of new budget authority (as under current law), outlays (as under current law), or receipts (instead of revenues) and the surplus or deficit (as under current law) for the current year, the budget year, and the ensuing nine outyears based on laws enacted through the applicable date. The bill would include estimates for direct spending in the baseline calculation formula for the budget year and each outyear. The bill would revise the formula for calculating the baseline for discretionary spending for the budget year and each outyear to eliminate adjustments for: (1) expiring multiyear subsidized housing contracts; (2) administrative expenses of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, the Unemployment Trust Fund, and the Railroad Retirement account; (3) offsets to federal employees' annual pay; and (4) certain inflators used to adjust budgetary resources in the Act. The bill would require the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to report to the congressional budget committees, on or before July 1 of each year, the Long- Term Budget Outlook for: (1) the fiscal year commencing on October 1 of that year, and (2) at least the ensuing 40 fiscal years. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Budget on June 19, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 1871 would change certain assumptions governing baseline budget projections and require the Congressional Budget Office to provide its Long-Term Budget Outlook report to the House and Senate Committees on the Budget annually. The CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1871 would not have a significant impact on the federal budget. Enacting H.R. 1871 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. The legislation would change the way in which discretionary appropriations for individual accounts are projected in CBO‚Äôs baseline. Under H.R. 1871, projections of such spending would still be based on the current year‚Äôs appropriations, but would not be adjusted for inflation going forward. Other adjustments to projections of future discretionary spending would also be eliminated. (In its baseline, CBO assumes that appropriations through 2021 will comply with the caps and other provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011; as a result, the method of extrapolating discretionary spending may not affect the totals reported in CBO‚Äôs projections.) H.R. 1871 also would require that CBO produce its Long- Term Budget Outlook by July 1 each year. Any additional administrative costs to implement H.R. 1871 would be insignificant, because CBO already carries out similar activities. H.R. 1871 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would have no impact on the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Baseline Reform Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on May 8, 2013 by Rep. Rob Woodall (R, GA-7). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on the Budget. On June 25, 2013, the bill was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-129. Debate and discussion Republicans argued that the bill would improve Congress' ability to balance the federal budget. When this and two other budget reform bill were introduced, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan said that \\"these reforms are an important step toward restoring fiscal discipline in Washington,\\" arguing that \\"by improving the budget process, we can get a better handle on our spending problem.\\" Speaking specifically about this bill, Ryan said that \\"families don't get automatic raises every year. Neither should Washington.\\" Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX), one of the bill's main sponsors, said that \\"conservatives have advocated for years that there should be no automatic spending increases in any federal department's budget... that has been a trap so when we simply slow the rate of increase, we are accused of making draconian cuts.\\" Gohmert argued that this legislation would make clearer \\"what is an increase and what is a cut,\\" put the government in the same situation as American families (who do not get automatic increases), and help with the task of getting the debt under control. Columnist Bruce Bartlett strongly criticized the bill, calling it an example of \\"Republican duplicity.\\" Bartlett contends that one of the CBO's necessary assumptions is that \\"when Congress creates a spending program that its intent is to maintain spending in real terms, adding spending as necessary to compensate for inflation.\\" This bill would instruct the CBO not to take inflation into account, which would cause real spending to \\"fall by the rate of inflation.\\" According to Bartlett, this legislation would allow Republicans to hold the spending constant on programs they don't like in order to avoid directly cutting them, even as inflation reduces the real spending on that program for them. Bartlett says that Republicans will \\"let inflation do their dirty work\\" and that this bill \\"is part of a long-term effort to eliminate data collection or pervert it so that policy is biased toward Republican priorities.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Baseline (budgeting) Notes/References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 1871 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 1871 *GovTrack.us H.R. 1871 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 1871 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 1871 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 1871 *House Report 113-129 on H.R. 1871 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Baseline Reform Act of 2013"},{"id":"42336585","text":"Wattebledia siamensis is a species of freshwater snail with a gill and an operculum, an aquatic gastropod mollusk in the family Bithyniidae.

Biography  Yasuharu Suematsu was born on September 22, 1932, in Gifu, Japan. He received both his B.S. (1955) and Ph.D. (1960) from the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Afterwards, he joined the faculty of the Tokyo Institute of Technology as a professor, and became its president in 1989. Later he also held the positions as firstKochi University of Technology: Congratulating Professor Emeritus Yasuharu Suematsu on winning the Japan Prize. Dated January 31, 2014, Archived copy at archive.org President of the newly founded Kochi University of Technology and later became Director General of the National Institute of Informatics. He authored at least 19 books and more than 260 scientific papers.  Research  Professor Suematsu is best known for his contributions to the development of optical fiber communication. He developed semiconductor lasers which even under high-speed modulation produce light at a stable wavelength which coincides with the wavelength region where the optical losses of fibers reach its minimum.The Japan Prize Foundation: Pioneering research on semiconductor lasers for high-capacity, long-distance optical fiber communication, Archived copy at archive.org Fig.1. Replica of the earliest demonstration of optical fiber communication experiment, on May 26, 1963, restored in 2008-7. (Registered as Future Technology Heritage, at the National Museum of Science, Japan). By courtesy of the Museum of Tokyo Institute of Technology. =The Earliest Demonstration of Optical Fiber Communication Experiment= The earliest demonstration of optical fiber communication was performed by Suematsu and his students, on May 26, 1963, in the occasion of open house of the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Fig.1). The light source was helium-neon gas laser, the modulator was hand made modulator by use of ADP crystal, applied signal voice voltage of 1.200 volts, for polarization rotation in response to voice signal, the optical bundle glass fiber for the transmission medium, and the photomultiplier tube for detector. The original ADP reserved in desiccator as well as the replica of that experiment, restored in 2008-7 as shown in Fig.1, were registered as a Future Technology Heritage, at the National Museum of Science, Japan, in 2019.

Laser tip on mount of the first demonstration of dynamic single mode laser at wavelength of 1.5 micrometers, in October 1980. By courtesy of the Museum of Tokyo Institute of Technology. Fig.4. Single mode property and schematic structure of the first demonstration of dynamic single mode laser at wavelength of 1.5 micrometers, in October 1980. =Creation of Dynamic Single Mode Lasers= Light is the highest frequency of electromagnetic waves that humans can control. It outperforms radio waves by a wide margin in transmitting a large capacity of information. Research into optical communications was undertaken such as in U.S.A., Japan, and England. The nature of optical fiber communication was thought possibly being able to transmit a large capacity of information over a long distance, all over the world. To make it a reality, the focus was on creating a Dynamic Single Mode laser (DSM laser) (Fig.2) which has the following three characteristics: (1) operates at a wavelength band which causes minimal loss within the optical fiber to allow for long-distance transmission (1.5 micrometers was discovered to be the ideal wavelength band during the course of following research); (2) operates stably at a single wavelength to surmount the problem of transmission capacity reduction due to dispersion on the propagation constant in single mode optical fiber; and (3) allows the wavelength to be tuned to adapt to communication in multiple wavelengths. First, in 1972‚Äì1974, Suematsu and his student proposed a single mode resonator which would consist of refractive index waveguide for the transverse mode, and two distributed reflectors joined together with a phase shift by odd numbers of a half œÄ for the axial single mode operation (Fig.2) . In the meantime, Suematsu pioneered materials for a mixed crystal of GaInAsP/InP for a semiconductor laser that would operate at a wavelength band of 1.5 micrometers‚Äîwhich causes minimal loss inside the optical fiber as Donald A. Keck et al. suggested in 1973‚Äî and continuously operates at room temperature, in July 1979. Following these preliminary achievements, Suematsu and his co- workers succeeded in creating an integrated laser with built-in distributed reflectors using a material in the band of 1.5 micrometers. In October 1980, Suematsu and his students had built a dynamic single mode laser that stably operates at a single mode even under rapid direct modulation (Fig.3 and Fig.4), and continuously operates at room temperature. This laser remained in stable operation mode even when the temperature was changed, so that the wavelength could be tuned thermally within the 1.5 micrometers band. Thus, the thermo-tunable dynamic single mode laser was born and triggered to develop 1.5 micrometer high speed fiber system, as cited by such as the 1983 Valdemar Poulsen Gold Medal, the Danish history of optical communication, and the 1986 David Sarnoff Award . Its spectral behavior was investigated profoundly to attain full single mode operation. Meanwhile, research and development progressed at industries in areas such as optical fibers, optical circuits, optical devices, modulation schemes, and system structures. The actualization of the dynamic single mode laser became an impetus to develop high-capacity and long-distance optical fiber communications, and it began to be applied commercially in the end of the 1980s.

A commercial phase shift distributed reflector laser array, with 100\\\\ coin for size reference. By courtesy of Furukawa Electric Co. Fig.7. Schematic structure of Wavelength Tunable Laser ~ Electro, in 1980 ~Electro- tunable Dynamic Single Mode Laser ~. =Phase-Shift Distributed Feedback Laser= Among these, the phase-shift distributed feedback (DFB) laser that Suematsu and his students proposed in 1974 and demonstrated with Kazuhito Furuya in November 1983 (Fig.5) is a thermo-tunable dynamic single mode laser which had a high rate of production yield, as cited by the 1985 Electronics Letter Premium Award, IEE, UK . Since the beginning of the 1990s, it had been consistently and widely used commercially as a standard laser for long- distance use, as awarded by the 1994 C&C; Prize . Often, laser array is used to cover wide wavelength region (Fig.6). = Wavelength Tunable Laser= On the other hand, the electro-tunable dynamic single mode laser, which would be a goal of the Dynamic Single Mode Laser, is, so called, a wavelength tunable laser that was proposed by Suematsu and his students in 1980 (Fig.7) and demonstrated in 1983. Later, the tuning wavelength range was increased by introduction into distributed reflectors with multi-grating pitches by Yuhichi Tohmori and Yuhzou Yoshikuni, and Larry Coldren. The electro-tunable dynamic single mode laser is especially important because it could be finely tunable and also monolithically integrable together with other photonic devices which needs the specific thermal tuning separately in the form of PICs (Photonic Integrated Circuits). It was around 2004, through the efforts of those involved, that this wavelength tunable laser was developed and used commercially in dense wavelength division multiplexing (D-WDM) systems and the optical coherent systems. It became utilized in earnest around 2010. thumbupright=2.0Fig.8. International submarine cables around the world. By courtesy of KDDI. Fig.9. Transmission performance of communication fiber. Prime data by Courtesy of NTT & KDDI. Social Contribution by Research High-capacity and long-distance optical fiber communications in the lowest loss wavelength band of 1.5 micrometers use dynamic single mode lasers (DSM lasers), such as phase shift distributed feedback lasers and wavelength tunable lasers, as their light sources, and have progressed along with research and development of optical fiber, optical devices, modulation schemes, and the like. Phase shift distributed feedback lasers developed by this research have been commercially applied for long distances‚Äîfor overland trunk systems (1987) and for intercontinental submarine cables (1992) (Fig. 8) ‚Äîand continue to support the progress of the Internet to this day. Later, since around 2004, wavelength tunable lasers are being used as the light source to advance dense wavelength division multiplexing (D-WDM) systems and optical coherent fiber systems for multi-level modulation schemes. Optical fiber communications make up a highly dense communications network circling the globe tens of thousands of times, and are also used in applications such as middle-distance Ethernets. Additionally, DSM lasers in the band of 1.5 micrometers are used for optical lines from the exchange center to the home in FTTH. The transmission performance of fiber represented by product of the transmission capacity and the distance has been increased yearly by exponentially, as shown in Fig. 9. In such ways, the information transmission capability of optical fiber has reached several hundred thousand times as much as the coaxial cables preceding them, and have significantly lowered the cost of transmitting information. Reflecting this, the mid-1990s saw the network industry such as Yahoo, Google and Rakuten appear one after the other. Optical fiber communications has progressed and the Internet has developed, and instantaneous transmission of a large volume of knowledge is now a daily occurrence. In 2018, the Internet population reached 39 Billions, 52% of world population. In the electrical communication era of the 1960s, large volumes of data, such as documents on which civilization depend on, were circulated slowly in forms such as books. In contrast, the proliferation of high-capacity and long-distance optical fiber communications has allowed for large-volume information such as books to become used interactively in an instant. The research of optical fiber communications contributed to the rapid transition to a civilization based on information and communications technology.

It was originally the house of Louise Lincoln Kerr and was willed to the university upon her death in 1977. In 2010, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History =Louise Lincoln Kerr= Louise Lincoln was born in Cleveland in 1892. She learned the piano and viola from her mother and then studied at Barnard College in New York. She married Peter Kjer in 1936 (the family name was changed to Kerr) and had eight children. One of them had a respiratory condition, which prompted the family to move to Phoenix in 1936. She bought 47 acres of land in Scottsdale along Lincoln Drive, named for her father. After Peter died three years later, Louise returned to writing music. She also was a benefactor of musical institutions in the Valley, including the Phoenix Symphony and the ASU School of Music. Other musical societies met at her house, including the Phoenix Chamber Music Society and National Society of Arts and Letters. The Kerr studio was Scottsdale's premier music venue until the Scottsdale Center for the Arts opened in 1975. =Under the university= Upon Kerr's death on December 10, 1977, Arizona State University's College of Fine Arts (now the Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts) received the property, and in 1981, management of the center passed from the College of Fine Arts to Gammage Memorial Auditorium. The transfer also involved further renovations to the site, including a lighted parking lot, new furnace and air conditioning units for the house, and code compliance work. Further changes were made in 1988, primarily involving re-roofing the studio and repairing the walls. Architecture The five-room house was constructed in 1948. It is of a Spanish Colonial style and is made of adobe that was made and built on the property. On the north end of the east wall is a simple ramada, and the southeast corner of the house features a wooden staircase that provides access to the flat roof.Historic Significance and Integrity Assessment Report for Listing Louise Lincoln Kerr Cultural Center on the Scottsdale Historic Register, n.d. The entry doors were carved out of sugar pine by Tucson artist Charles Bolsius, a friend of Kerr. The windows are plain squares with brick windowsills and oversized wooden lintels. The studio was completed in 1959 to the north of the house, with an addition on the west end finished in 1969. Featuring the same natural adobe bricks as the house, the studio is covered by a low-pitched roof that flattens out further to cover the patios on the west and east sides. The studio features exposed rafters and a brick chimney at one corner. Bolsius carved the entry doors for the studio; the main east entry is surrounded by a doorframe featuring empty beer bottles set into the brick. The 1969 expansion was completed by architect Fred Fleenor and included built-in seating for 100, improved lighting, and kitchen and restroom facilities; special attention was paid to making this addition match the rest of the building. The floor tiles are exceptionally rare today; they are made of a mixture of cement and white marble dust. Also on the property were several cottages, nicknamed \\"The Shacks\\"; guests including Pablo Casals, Isaac Stern and the Budapest String Quartet stayed in these cottages. They were removed sometime between Kerr's death in 1977 and the construction of the Marriott Renaissance Scottsdale resort in 1979/1980. Current use The Kerr Cultural Center still sees regular use, in part due to its intimate setting and also because it is commonly regarded as the best venue for chamber music in the Phoenix area. It is used as a venue for musical performances as well as small conferences and private parties.

It is loosely based on the 2010 film Legion, written by Peter Schink and Scott Stewart. In December 2013, Syfy ordered a pilot episode and the series premiered on the American cable television network Syfy on June 19, 2014. The show was filmed in Cape Town, South Africa. Stewart served as series executive producer, as well as director of the pilot episode, written by Wilmott. It was renewed for a 13-episode second season on September 25, 2014, which premiered on July 9, 2015, and concluded on October 1, 2015. On October 13, 2015, Syfy cancelled Dominion after two seasons. Synopsis God vanishes and in his absence the archangel Gabriel and his army of lower angels wage war against mankind, believing them to be the cause of God's absence. Although most higher angels remain neutral, Gabriel has convinced the lower angels, the \\"dogs of Heaven,\\" called \\"eight-balls\\" by humans for their black eyes, to fight alongside him. Twenty-five years later, mankind survives in a few fortified cities. The archangel Michael has chosen to side with humanity against Gabriel, living among humans in the fortified city of Vega (once Las Vegas) until the time a prophesied savior appears to save mankind. Cast =Main= * Christopher Egan as Sgt. 1st Class Alex Lannon: A young and often rebellious V2 soldier in Vega's Archangel Corps who discovers he is the unlikely savior of humanity, known as \\"The Chosen One\\", and the central figure of Vega's dominant official religion, known as \\"Saviorism\\". * Tom Wisdom as Archangel Michael: A legendary warrior known throughout history as the greatest of the archangels, Michael was the only angel to take humanity's side during The Extermination War, turning against his own kind, and was instrumental in defeating his brother Gabriel and saving what was left of mankind. He is Vega's protector and commander of the Archangel Corps. * Roxanne McKee as Lady Claire Riesen: A teacher to orphan children and believer in Saviorism, Claire is Alex's lover. Originally Vega's princess and heir to her father's seat, Claire later ascends as ruler of Vega as Lady of the City. * Luke Allen-Gale as William Whele: Vega's Principate, William was the religious leader of the Church of The Savior, the religion that has grown since The Extermination War, all based around the concept of The Chosen One. William is secretly loyal to Gabriel and leader of his Black Acolytes in Vega. * Kim Engelbrecht as Sgt. Noma Banks (recurring, season 1; main cast, season 2): A sergeant in Vega's Archangel Corps, Noma is Alex's friend and fellow soldier, who maintains a casual sexual relationship with him. Noma is secretly a higher angel loyal to Michael, assigned by him to watch over Alex. She's revealed later in season 2 to be a follower of Lucifer. * Shivani Ghai as Arika/Evelyn: The beautiful and wily Queen of Helena, a distant and mysterious fortified city, Evelyn originally came to Vega as \\"Arika\\" ‚Äì supposedly the consort and wife of Queen Evelyn and a diplomat who is part of a negotiating party. Evelyn's true agendas are deceptive, secretive and mysterious to the residents of Vega. Evelyn acts to maintain the peace between Vega and Helena, maneuvering throughout Vega's leadership with grace and skill. * Rosalind Halstead as Senator Becca Thorn (season 1): One of the Senate's consuls, the head of House Thorn and Riesen's confidant, Becca is one of the most powerful leaders in Vega, overseeing all scientific and medical personnel in the city. * Carl Beukes as Archangel Gabriel (recurring, season 1; main cast, season 2): An archangel and enemy of mankind, Michael's \\"twin\\" (in the hierarchy of angels) and the unstable but masterfully manipulative leader of the angels in the war against humanity, Gabriel is responsible for pushing humanity to the brink of extinction after God's disappearance - his aim is to exterminate mankind, believing this will bring God back. * Anthony Head as Senator David Whele: Vega's Secretary of Commerce, one of the Senate's consuls, the head of House Whele and William's father. David is the chief of administrator of Vega and the second most powerful leader in the city, responsible for keeping every government department running while the Lord commands the military. A ruthless and cunning political operator, David is an ambitious power broker, and an utterly ruthless and narcissistic politician, who is always on the hunt to keep or grow his power by any means necessary. Before the war, David was a devotedly faithful televangelist, but he lost his faith when the angels descended from Heaven and his family was killed by the Possessed. * Alan Dale as Gen. Edward Riesen: Vega's Lord of the City, the head of House Riesen and Claire's father. Riesen is Vega's selfless ruler and military leader who remains a paragon of strength and duty, despite his failing health. Before the war, Riesen was a civilian accountant who studied military history - during the opening hours of the Extermination War, he took a dead general's uniform and name, later leading humanity to victory. Season 1 * Langley Kirkwood as Jeep Hanson: Alex's adoptive father and Charlie's husband (from Legion), Jeep was a hero of Vega long presumed dead in The Extermination War, and known publicly as Vega's \\"prophet\\" for The Chosen One. * Jonathan Howard as Sgt. Ethan Mack: A sergeant in Vega's Archangel Corps who works as a guard for House Whele, and Noma and Alex's best friend and fellow soldier. * Betsy Wilke as Bixby: A young V1 orphan, Bixby barely eked out an existence in Vega, but was then granted the protection of House Riesen, as well as a greatly improved standard of living. * Anton David Jeftha as Furiad: One of the higher angels who have joined Gabriel in his war against humanity, Furiad is Noma's former lover and leader of Gabriel's High Guards. * Katrine De Candole as Archangel Uriel: An archangel, Michael and Gabriel's sister and Raphael's \\"twin\\" (in the hierarchy of angels), Uriel resurfaces after years underground, a new player of uncertain intentions and loyalties. Her sly, scheming tendencies make her a bit of a loose cannon, and both of her brothers call her insane. * Kevin Otto as Louis: A neutral higher angel and a refugee from The Extermination War, Louis was a mild-mannered grocer living and working in Vega as a vendor in the marketplace. * Amy Bailey as Clementine Riesen: Riesen's wife and Claire's mother, Clementine is now one of the Possessed angels, kept by Riesen living at the abandoned Luxor hotel. She retained enough of her human memories to maintain a clandestine relation with Riesen, although it was entirely forbidden and put her at extreme risk, as she would be condemned by both her own kind and the humans of Vega. * Tyrone Keogh as Lt. Vince: A security guard for House Whele. * Kenneth Fok as Capt. Finch: A captain in Vega's Archangel Corps, and Alex, Noma and Ethan's firm and unforgiving superior officer. * Danny Keogh as Senator Thomas Frost: One of Vega's senators, Frost is a leader of Vega and is responsible for the city‚Äôs \\"Agritowers\\", in which much of the food is grown. One of the city's founding fathers, Frost is a powerful believer in the coming of The Chosen One, and is an honest politician allied with Riesen and Michael against David Whele, valuing the truth above all else. * Fiona Ramsay as Senator Blanch Romero: One of Vega's senators, Romero is one of the leaders of Vega and is responsible for the vitally important nuclear reactor that powers the city. A shrewd politician, Romero has aligned herself with David Whele and against Riesen (when the political winds dictate it). * Luam Staples as Roan: Originally appearing as a mysterious child savant, Roan accompanied Arika and her retinue of women from Helena to Vega. Favored by Evelyn, the leader of Helena, the silent boy was suspected to be far more than he seemed. Roan is revealed to be one of the higher angels who have joined Gabriel in his war against humanity. * Julie Hartley as Felicia Aldreen: Claire's servant at House Riesen, Felicia was originally a neutral higher angel and a refugee from The Extermination War, though she later sided secretly with Gabriel. Season 2 * Nicholas Bishop as Gates Foley: A brilliant but troubled military genius who helped build Vega into the stronghold it has become. Gates is an engineer and an old friend of Riesen and harbors romantic desire for Claire, and maintains the systems that power the city. He is an MIT alumnus and a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan, using the 2004 ALCS as encouragement to solve complex problems. * Simon Merrells as Julian: The cunning and powerful leader of New Delphi, Julian is a cryptic man with motives as questionable as his past and will go to any lengths to protect his city. It is later revealed Julian is a Dyad; a symbiosis between a human and a higher angel, controlled by the spirit of Lyrae, a higher angel killed by Michael centuries ago for horrific atrocities against humans during the siege of Sodom and Gomorrah, and his spirit banished to become a hybrid. * Christina Chong as Zoe Holloway: A member of Vega‚Äôs Archangel Corps who deserted her position, unable to tolerate guarding V6s. Zoe is bold, fierce and scrappy and joins the V1 rebel faction to overthrow Claire's government. * Olivia Mace as Laurel: The steadfast leader of Mallory, Alabama ‚Äì a small southern town of survivors who have inexplicably managed to insulate themselves from the fallout of The Extermination War, Laurel is deeply devout to her religious faith and is unwavering in her resolve. Unknown to her, her town was saved by Lucifer who is using them to return. * Luke Tyler as Pete: An energetic, bright, dynamic, and eternally optimistic teenager who grew up in Missouri before the apocalypse. Pete was a Possessed angel, until Alex performed an eviction that restored his humanity. He wakes up on the road in the battle-torn world, with no memories of his possession, but retaining his peaceful past. He is later repossessed by the same lesser angel. * Diarmaid Murtagh as Wes Fuller: A resident of Mallory who is loyal to Laurel but distrustful of Michael. * Hakeem Kae-Kazim as The Prophet: A mysterious figure that appears to Noma in the woods. His image appears in the church at Mallory, and he has the power to set the Possessed on fire with a gesture, consuming them from within. He is later revealed to be working with Lucifer and trying to bring him back to life. * Reine Swart as Charlie: Alex's mother, killed by Noma, while protecting Alex as a baby.

King (born 1941) is a British-born orientalist and historian of astronomy.  Biography  At an early age he decided not to follow in the footsteps of his father, Henry C. King (1915 - 2005), author of The History of the Telescope (1956) and the first director of the London Planetarium and later of the McClaughlin Planetarium in Toronto. Instead he learned Arabic and went off to the Near East and then to the U.S to immerse himself in Medieval Islamic Studies. However, after one year of graduate school he found himself, not unwillingly, deeply entrenched in the field of the History of Astronomy, ecstatic with what he had found in the first medieval Arabic scientific manuscripts that he encountered. These first discoveries made in 1970 are now documented on MuslimHeritage.org. Thus began his journey into the then undocumented area of what he has called ‚Äúastronomy in the service of Islam‚Äù. His basic education was at Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe (1952‚Äì59), where from age 14 onward he studied only mathematics, physics and chemistry, and from age 16-18 only mathematics (he has long regarded this kind of specialisation for children as ridiculous). Before going to university he worked as a ‚ÄòWerkstudent‚Äô at Carl Zeiss in Oberkochen (1960). He then studied Mathematics at Jesus College, Cambridge (B.A. 1963), Education at Oxford University (Dip.Ed. 1964), and Near Eastern Languages and Literatures at Yale University (Ph.D. 1972). In between studying he travelled extensively in W. and E. Europe and the Near East. His first appointment was with the Sudan Government Ministry of Education (Atbara and El-Fasher, Darfur, 64-67). Thereafter he directed a project in the history of Islamic astronomy funded by the Smithsonian Institution (Foreign Currency Program) at the American Research Center in Egypt (72-79), cataloguing the 2,500 medieval Arabic scientific manuscripts in the Egyptian National Library and using Cairo as a base for research in manuscript libraries all over the world. His first university position was as Associate Professor, then Full Professor, of Near Eastern Languages and Literatures at New York University (1979‚Äì85). In 1985 he was invited to become Professor of History of Science and Director of the Institute for the History of Science, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main. The Institute flourished as one of the leading centres in the world for unrestricted research in the history of Islamic science but was closed when he retired in 2007.  Research on aspects of the history of Islamic science  King's mentor in medieval Arabic and Islamic Studies at Yale University was Prof. Franz Rosenthal, who gave him photos of an Istanbul manuscript of a mathematical text by Samaw‚Äôal al-Maghrib√Æ for his first assignment. His mentor in the History of Science and his doctoral advisor was Prof. Bernard R. Goldstein, who encouraged him to investigate for his dissertation the H√¢kim√Æ Z√Æj of the 10th-century Egyptian astronomer Ibn Y√ªnus. A z√Æj is an astronomical handbook containing tables mainly for solar, lunar, planetary and stellar astronomy, together with explanatory text. The z√Æjes of al-Khw√¢rizm√Æ (Baghdad, ca. 830) and al-Batt√¢n√Æ (Raqqa, ca. 910) are the best- known examples (because they became known in medieval Europe) but they are hardly the best or most interesting examples. In 1956 Prof. Edward S. Kennedy of the American University of Beirut had published a survey of some 125 z√Æjes, and King was able to augment this number by a few dozen during visits to libraries around the world and whilst collaborating with Prof. Kennedy in Beirut, Cairo and Frankfurt. This most fundamental research on the Islamic astronomical heritage is currently being brought to a conclusion with a grand total of some 225 z√Æjes' from al-Andalus to India and from the Yemen to Central Asia by Dr. Benno van Dalen of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences in Munich. The number and scope and variety of these works attest to the phenomenal interest of Muslim astronomers in the technical aspects of their subject. King's doctoral research uncovered a vast number of manuscripts of tables not from z√Æjes but for timekeeping and regulating the times of prayer for Cairo associated with Ibn Y√ªnus, as well as related tables for Damascus, Jerusalem, Tunis, Taiz, and elsewhere. His later research led to the first regional histories of astronomy in Egypt, Syria, the Yemen, and the Maghreb. The main thrust of King's research over close to 50 years has been the documentation, by means of hundreds of previously-unstudied Arabic manuscripts, of the ways in which astronomy ‚Äì not only mathematical astronomy but also non-mathematical folk astronomy ‚Äì was used over the centuries in the service of Islam: the regulation of the lunar calendar; the organisation of the five daily prayers; and the determination of the sacred direction (qibla) toward the sacred Kaaba in Mecca. These studies led to an understanding of the reasons behind the definitions of the times of the day-light prayers in terms of shadow increases over the midday minimum, as well as the reasons for the often curious orientations of medieval mosques. The first volume of his magnum opus entitled In Synchrony with the Heavens (2004) contains the first descriptions of the astronomical tables used by Muslim astronomers for timekeeping by the sun and stars and the regulation of the astronomically- defined times of Muslim prayer throughout the year for different localities. The sophistication of some of these tables and instruments is remarkable, especially those that are universal, in the sense of serving all latitudes. Also remarkable is the way in which Muslim astronomers tabulated all conceivable functions relevant to the problems of spherical astronomy. The vast majority of these tables were unknown in medieval Europe, which is why they have only come to light in modern times. Research on astronomical instruments The second volume of King's In Synchrony with the Heavens (2005) deals with the instruments that they also used: sundials, astrolabes and quadrants. Detailed descriptions of all known instruments from the Islamic East up till 1100 are presented as well as of many historically-important later ones. Many of these are scientific works of art. Pride of place is taken threefold by (1) the spectacular astrolabe of the 10th-century astronomer H√¢mid ibn Khidr al-Khujand√Æ, made in Baghdad in 984; (2) the quintuply- universal astrolabe of Ibn al-Sarr√¢j, constructed in Aleppo in 1327 (the most sophisticated astrolabe ever made); (3) and a 14th-century astrolabe with inscriptions in Hebrew, Latin and Arabic, made in Toledo and then taken to Algiers. King was the first to study medieval astronomical instruments, first Islamic ones, then European ones, as historical sources deserving the same respect as manuscripts. Several of the most historically important ones had been declared suspicious or fake by colleagues who did not know the language of instruments. An astrolabe signed by a late-13th-century Yemeni sultan al- Ashraf had been declared a fake because ‚Äúthere was no astronomy in the Yemen‚Äù. In fact, it is one of six astrolabes described by the Sultan's teachers in a text appended to a highly sophisticated treatise on the construction and use of the astrolabe authored by the Sultan al-Ashraf himself. The oldest Latin astrolabe, from 10th-century Catalonia, desperately needed to be reinstated after it had been declared a fake by scholars versed only in the medieval astrolabe textual tradition. King published lists of all known medieval instruments, Islamic and Western, arranged chronologically by region (as far as this is possible), to facilitate future research, as well as catalogue in preparation, now available online. He also was able to show that various instruments long thought to have been of medieval European inspiration, such as the universal horary quadrant with movable solar-calendrical scale (12th- century Spain) and the universal horary device for timekeeping by the sun known as the navicula de Venetiis (14th-century England) were actually devised in 9th-century Baghdad, as was the universal horary device for timekeeping by the stars. A forgotten number notation from the Middle Ages A 14th-century French astrolabe from Picardy featuring all numbers in ingenious monastic ciphers, merited a book (The Ciphers of the Monks) (2002). This documents the origins of the notation in Ancient Greek tachygraphy through Cistercian monasteries in England and what is now the border country between Belgium and France during the Middle Ages down to its afterlife in Renaissance books. The remarkable notation enables each digit from 1 to 9,999 to be represented by a unique cipher. The first scientific instrument of the Renaissance, not a fake but the key to the most enigmatic painting of the Quattrocento The beautiful little astrolabe dedicated by the young German astronomer Regiomontanus to his sponsor the Greek Cardinal Bessarion in Rome in 1462 (deemed suspicious by ‚Äòexperts‚Äô after it had been auctioned at Christie's on the strength of an accurate expert description!) is one out of a dozen astrolabes from the same Vienna school preserved in museums around the world. An image of an angel defied identification until it was realised that Bessarion had been named after an early Egyptian saint who was venerated as an angel in the Byzantine liturgy. Furthermore, the Latin dedication is an acrostic with hidden meanings and the vertical axes of the acrostic define eight spaces containing letters that identify (more than once) the eight persons depicted in the enigmatic ‚ÄòFlagellation of Christ‚Äô by Piero della Francesca. It seems that the concept of the painting and the persons depicted in it were derived from the epigram. The painting is polysemous, as are the images of the eight persons in it and even the statue of a classical god atop the column behind Jesus. This explains the difficulty it has presented to historians of art over 200 years. Some 50 different interpretations of the identities of the three moderns on the right of the painting have been proposed, and not a few of these have now been shown to be appropriate, even when they are mutually inconsistent. To understand the astrolabe and its Latin inscription and the nature and significance and potential of the acrostic and the letter combinations it contains is essential before one can begin to appreciate the persons portrayed in the painting. Having deciphered these Renaissance games, we now know, for example, that the angel featured on the astrolabe, St. Bessarion, inspired the angelic figure in the painting, who represents Regiomontanus as well as three recently deceased youths from Bessarion's circle. King does not expect that these revelations, documented in \\"Astrolabes and Angels, Epigrams and Enigmas\\" will be digestible for art historians. In 2013 King was awarded the Koyr√© Medal of the Acad√©mie internationale d'histoire des sciences for his life's work. Personal King is married since 1969 to Patricia Cannavaro King and the couple have two sons and one granddaughter. He currently resides between Frankfurt city-centre and a small village in Southern France.

It contains a number of well-preserved 15th-century frescos attributed to Albertus Pictor. History H√§rkeberga Church is built in an old cultural landscape, and close to the church archaeological discoveries have been made of objects from the Bronze Age and Iron Age. The church itself dates from the early 14th century. Few alterations have been made to the original building. The vestry and the main body of the church are original. In the 15th century, a church porch, a single buttress was added and the interior embellished with brick vault, adorned with frescos by Albertus Pictor. It is for these frescos that the church is most well known. Since then, no major alterations have been made to the church. Architecture The church is a hall church with two windows in the southern wall and a group of three windows in the eastern wall of the choir, all original but later (18th century) enlarged. The attached vestry is original and contains traces of 14th century frescos, imitating masonry. A door with medieval iron decoration connects the church porch (c. 1480) and the church, and in the entrance door traces of the original, medieval cloth that once covered the door remain. Internally, the church is embellished with richly decorated vaults, created by Albertus Pictor. The frescos date from around 1480 and are unusually well-preserved, since they have not been covered with whitewash or painted over. In the vault above the choir, the instruments of the Passion are depicted, held by angels. Above the altar is Christ with bleeding wounds. In the rest of the church there are stories from the Old Testament, but also secular motifs, like the Wheel of Fortune. In addition, demons, imaginary animals and beasts are represented throughout the church. Although the work is not signed, it can be attributed to Albertus Pictor on stylistic grounds. The frescos in H√§rkeberga Church are considered by some to be Pictor's finest and most well-preserved work. Most of the church furnishings date from the 18th century, including the pulpit, considered an unusually fine piece made by Jean Baptiste Masreliez in 1791. The triumphal cross is as old as the church itself, probably made for it when it was new. The church stands in a cemetery, surrounded by a low wall. The gate in the wall is probably medieval but redesigned during the 18th century. The wooden bell tower is from the 17th century; the church has never had a stone tower.

Widely recognized as \\"modern British ballet's first male virtuoso,\\"Jane Simpson, \\"Legend: Harold Turner.\\" Ballet Magazine (June 2000). he had an illustrious career as a principal dancer, after which he continued to perform in character roles. He is acknowledged as a key figure in British dance history. Early life and training Harold Turner was born in Manchester, in northwestern England. The son of Edward Harold Turner and Laura (Greenwood) Turner, he was raised in a cultured, musical household. His father was a viola player with the Hall√© Orchestra, based in Manchester, and with the London Symphony Orchestra.Arnold Haskell, \\"Turner, Harold (1909‚Äì1962)\\", in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, edited by H.C.G. Matthew and Brian Harrison (Oxford University Press, 2004). accessed 28 March 2014 His mother, who had interests in the performing arts, supported his decision to begin ballet training in 1925 at the relatively late age of 16. He studied first with Alfred Haines in Manchester. Blessed with a lithe, muscular physique and innate musicality, he quickly showed an aptitude for classical ballet. He made his professional debut with the Haines English Ballet while still a teenager. Then, encouraged by L√©onide Massine, he moved to London and continued his studies with Marie Rambert at her school in Bedford Gardens.Barbara Newman, \\"Turner, Harold,\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 6, p. 213. Career Remarkably, Turner mastered classical ballet technique in very few years. He was invited to perform with a number of fledgling British ballet companies, becoming known for his virtuosity and exciting stage presence. He danced with Rambert's Ballet Club for several years, from 1928 to 1932.Marie Rambert, Quicksilver: An Autobiography (London: Macmillan, 1972). In 1930 the ballerina Tamara Karsavina joined Rambert's performing group as a guest artist and chose Turner, then only 20 years old, to partner her in Le Spectre de la Rose, a work originally choreographed for her and Vaslav Nijinsky by Michel Fokine.Newman, \\"Turner, Harold\\" (1997).Haskell, \\"Turner, Harold\\" (2004). There was not much partnering to do, but the buoyant role of the Spirit of the Rose required exceptional elevation, ballon, and stamina. In 1935, Turner joined the Vic-Wells Ballet, a predecessor of today's Royal Ballet, as a principal dancer.Mary Clarke, Sadler's Wells Ballet: A History and an Appreciation (London: A.&C.; Black, 1955). At the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells theatres, he danced major roles in productions of both classical and contemporary ballets, including the Bluebird in The Sleeping Beauty, Franz in Copp√©lia, Albrecht in Giselle, and Harlequin in Le Carnaval as well as in new works by Frederick Ashton and Ninette de Valois. Of the numerous roles he created during his five years with this company, the two most memorable are the Red Knight in Checkmate by de Valois and the Blue Boy in Les Patineurs (The Skaters) by Ashton. Both were created in 1937; both are principal male roles. The Red Knight is engaged in a dramatic, grim struggle of love and death with the Black Queen; the Blue Boy is a perky, lighthearted show-off performing dazzling tricks on a frozen pond. Turner excelled in each role. \\"It is arguable that he has never been surpassed, possibly never even equaled, in either of these very different creations. Certainly, at the time, no one else in the company could have tackled either one of them, and it was years before he was replaced in either role.\\"Simpson, \\"Legend: Harold Turner\\" (2000). The Vic-Wells Ballet, which was based at the Sadler's Wells Theatre, was renamed Sadler's Wells Ballet in 1939.Clarke, Sadler's Wells Ballet (1972). Turner remained with the company until 1951, with only two interruptions. In 1941-1942 he danced with Mona Inglesby's International Ballet, after which he served in the Royal Air Force during World War II. Upon returning to the Sadler's Wells Ballet in 1945, he shone in two works by Massine, La Boutique Fantasque (The Magic Toyshop) and Le Tricorne (The Three-Cornered Hat), in which he played the Miller, the role originated by Massine. With advancing age, he relinquished his bravura roles and transformed himself into an acclaimed character actor. Then, upon retirement, he taught at Sadler's Wells Ballet School, worked as ballet master of the Covent Garden Opera Ballet, and appeared occasionally as a guest artist with Sadler's Wells Ballet. Engaged to appear as the old Marquis di Luca in the 1962 revival of Massine's The Good-Humoured Ladies, he died of a heart attack on the way to his dressing room after a rehearsal at the Royal Opera House.Newman, \\"Turner, Harold\\" (1997), vol. 6, p. 214. He was 52 years old. Roles created Turner created a remarkable number of roles in a remarkable variety of ballets. Among them are principal or soloist roles in the following works:David Vaughan, Frederick Ashton and His Ballets (New York: Knopf, 1977).Katherine Sorley Walker, Ninette de Valois: Idealist without Illusions (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1987).Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell, \\"Turner, Harold,\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance (Oxford University Press), 2000.) * 1928.

Personal life Turner was married twice: first to Mary Honer (1914-1965), a virtuoso dancer with the Vic-Wells Ballet who had originated the role of one of the Blue Girls in Les Patineurs, then to Gerd Larsen (1921-2001), a dancer, ballet mistress, and principal mime with the Royal Ballet. Turner and Larsen were married from 1944 until his death in 1962. They had one child together, a daughter, Solveig, in 1952.Mary Clarke, \\"Gerd Larsen,\\" obituary, The Guardian (20 October 2001).

The bill would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The bill would also require the federal budget to reflect the net impact of programs administered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The changes made by the bill would mean that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt. These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the United States federal budget would be. The goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background This bill was introduced at the same time as the Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013 (H.R. 1874; 113th Congress) and the Baseline Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 1871; 113th Congress) as a package of budget reform bills. =Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac= The federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac refers to the placing into conservatorship of government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by the U.S. Treasury in September 2008. It was one of the financial events among many in the ongoing subprime mortgage crisis. On September 6, 2008, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), James B. Lockhart III, announced his decision to place two Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation), into conservatorship run by the FHFA. United States Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, stated that placing the two GSEs into conservatorship was a decision he fully supported, and that he advised \\"that conservatorship was the only form in which I would commit taxpayer money to the GSEs.\\" He further said that \\"I attribute the need for today's action primarily to the inherent conflict and flawed business model embedded in the GSE structure, and to the ongoing housing correction.\\" That same day, Federal Reserve Bank chairman Ben Bernanke stated his support: \\"I strongly endorse both the decision by FHFA Director Lockhart to place Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship and the actions taken by Treasury Secretary Paulson to ensure the financial soundness of those two companies.\\" The combined GSE losses of US$14.9 billion and market concerns about their ability to raise capital and debt threatened to disrupt the U.S. housing financial market. The Treasury committed to invest as much as US$200 billion in preferred stock and extend credit through 2009 to keep the GSEs solvent and operating. The two GSEs have outstanding more than US$5 trillion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and debt; the debt portion alone is $1.6 trillion. The conservatorship action has been described as \\"one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades,\\" and one that \\"could turn into the biggest and costliest government bailout ever of private companies\\". Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 would amend the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) (title V of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 [CBA]) to revise the budgetary treatment of federal direct loans and loan guarantees to account for them on a fair value basis (currently, a FCRA accrual basis). The bill would require the President's budget from FY1992 on to reflect the Treasury discounting component of direct loan and loan guarantee programs. Defines the \\"Treasury discounting component\\" as the estimated long-term cost to the federal government of a direct loan or loan guarantee (or modification) calculated on a net present value basis, excluding administrative costs and any incidental effects on governmental receipts or outlays. The bill would revise other requirements for the President's budget, beginning with FY2015, including conditions for new direct loans or loan guarantee commitments. Requires new budget authority for such loans or loan guarantee commitments to be provided in advance in an appropriation Act. The bill would exempt a direct loan or loan guarantee program that constitutes an entitlement (such as the guaranteed student loan program or the veteran's home loan guaranty program), all existing credit programs of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), or any direct loan or loan guarantee made by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) (government-sponsored enterprises or GSEs) from: (1) the above requirement, and (2) the prohibition against modification of an outstanding direct loan or loan guarantee in a manner that increases its costs unless budget authority for the additional cost has been provided in advance in an appropriation Act. The bill would repeal the general authorization of appropriations to federal agencies for the cost associated with such direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments. The bill would revise requirements for Treasury transactions with financing accounts (nonbudget accounts associated with each program account which holds balances, receives the cost payment from the program account, and also includes all other cash flows to and from the federal government resulting from direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments made on or after October 1, 1991). The bill would limit the availability of amounts in liquidating accounts to specified payments resulting from direct loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments made before October 1, 1991. The bill would amend the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to treat a change in discretionary spending solely as a result of the amendment to title V of the CBA made by this Act as a change of concept (requiring adjustments to discretionary spending limits). The bill would require the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), before adjusting such discretionary spending limits, to report to the congressional budget committees on the amount of that adjustment and other specified related matters. The bill would require each of the Directors of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to study and make recommendations to the congressional budget committees on the feasibility of applying fair value concepts to budgeting for the costs of federal insurance programs. The bill would require the receipts and disbursements, including the administrative expenses, of the GSEs to be counted as new budget authority, outlays, receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of: (1) the President's budget, (2) the congressional budget, and (3) the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. The bill would terminate mandatory on-budget status treatment for a GSE after all of the following occurs: (1) its conservatorship has been terminated; (2) the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has certified in writing that the GSE has repaid to the federal government the maximum amount consistent with minimizing the total federal cost of the financial assistance provided to the GSE; and (3) its charter has been revoked, annulled, or terminated and its authorizing statute has been repealed. The bill would require OMB to: (1) study the history of offsetting collections against expenditures and the amount of receipts collected annually, especially the historical application of the budgetary terms \\"revenue,\\" \\"offsetting collections,\\" and \\"offsetting receipts\\"; and (2) review the application of those terms and make recommendations to the congressional budget committees on whether such usage should be continued or modified. The bill would require any federal agency, whenever it prepares and submits written budget justification materials for any congressional committee, to post them on the same day as its submission on the \\"open\\" page of its public website. The bill would require OMB to: (1) post the budget justification in a centralized location on its website in an OMB developed format, and (2) notify each federal agency of the format in which to post it. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Budget on February 11, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 1872 would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs. Specifically, the bill would amend the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) to require that, beginning in fiscal year 2017, the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair- value basis using guidelines set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. A fair-value approach to accounting for the cost of federal loans and loan guarantees would produce estimates of costs that either correspond to or approximate the value of those loans or guarantees to buyers in the private market. The bill also would require that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) produce annual reports on the progress that federal agencies make in its implementation; the federal budget reflect the net impact of programs administered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; federal agencies post budget justifications on public websites on the same day they are submitted to the Congress; and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) prepare studies on the costs of federal insurance programs and the historical application of the budgetary terms revenue, offsetting collections, and offsetting receipts. The proposed changes to the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs would increase the estimated costs of such programs compared to measures used under current law. (This legislation would not change the terms of such credit programs, but would change what is recorded in the budget as the cost of credit assistance.) CBO estimates that if fair-value procedures were used to estimate the cost of new credit activity in 2014, the total deficit for the year would be about $50 billion greater than the deficit as measured under current estimating procedures. Because that increased cost would stem from a change in concepts and definitions used to prepare federal budget documents rather than a change in agencies‚Äô legal authority to operate credit programs, it would not be an additional cost attributed to H.R. 1872 for Congressional budget enforcement procedures. The CBO estimates that measuring the cost of federal credit programs on a fair- value basis as prescribed under H.R. 1872 would increase agencies‚Äô administrative costs to operate such programs. In addition, the requirements to post budget justifications on the Internet and produce studies would require additional resources. Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, the CBO estimates such costs would total $16 million over the 2014-2019 period. Pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply to this legislation because no additional direct spending would be attributable to H.R. 1872 since it would not change credit programs. The legislation would not affect revenues. H.R. 1872 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on May 8, 2013 by Rep. Scott Garrett (R, NJ-5). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on the Budget and the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. It was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-381 part 1 on March 18, 2014. Debate and discussion Republicans argued that the bill would improve Congress' ability to balance the federal budget. When this and two other budget reform bills were introduced, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan said that \\"these reforms are an important step toward restoring fiscal discipline in Washington,\\" arguing that \\"by improving the budget process, we can get a better handle on our spending problem.\\" Romina Boccia of the right-wing organization The Heritage Foundation wrote a report in favor of the legislation, arguing that \\"improper accounting in the budget for the downside risks that the GSEs (Government-sponsored enterprise) pose for American taxpayers is creating the illusion that the GSEs are a free lunch for Washington.\\" Boccia argued that because the GSEs were \\"off-budget\\", it changed the incentives and distorted the federal budget, hiding \\"the real cost to taxpayers from federal control of Fannie and Freddie.\\" The distortion is due to the federal government counting as income the profits, but not counting the debt of Fannie and Freddie as national debt. In contrast, Richard Kogan of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities argues that the bill would make \\"federal loan and loan guarantee programs look more expensive to the federal government than they really are.\\" Kogan expresses his concern that due to the apparently increased costs of various programs, policymakers may react by raising taxes and cutting programs. Kogan cites numbers from the CBO saying that 44 of the 100 programs that would be counted differently actually make money (through fees and interest), but 33 of them would look like they cost the government money under the bill's new counting requirements.

The Nashville cholera epidemic was part of the third cholera pandemic that occurred between 1846 and 1860. It began in South Asia and was spread globally by travelers. In the United States, the disease outbreak was first recorded in December 1848 at two ports: New York City on December 2 and New Orleans on December 11. It spread into the interior of the country along waterways, appearing in Nashville on January 20, 1849. The number of cases increased by June 1849. The death that month, in Nashville, of former president James K. Polk may have been due to cholera, possibly acquired during travels in other parts of the South. Cholera is reported to have been prevalent in the city around the time of his funeral, in June 1849. According to an account published in 1866, there were 311 cholera deaths in Nashville in 1849, a very large death toll for a city with a population of only about 10,000. The number of cases increased dramatically again in June and July 1850. Estimates of cholera deaths in 1850 range from 316 to about 500. There were 64 deaths from cholera in just the first 4 days of July 1850. The epidemic led the University of Nashville to suspend operations and led its president, Philip Lindsley, to resign. In a letter written on July 16, 1850, Mary Hamilton House reported to her husband that the epidemic was waning, as the death rate had dropped to only \\"three to six or eight deaths\\" per day. The following month, mineralogist Gerard Troost died in Nashville from cholera. Death of President Polk Former U.S. President James K. Polk returned to Tennessee during this outbreak. Polk was the 11th president of the United States, serving from 1845 to 1849.Polk Place, briefly James Polk's home and long that of his widow President Polk and his wife Sarah Polk left Washington on March 6 for a pre-arranged triumphal tour of the South, to end in Nashville.Bergeron, pp. 257‚Äì258 He and his wife previously arranged to buy a house in Nashville, which was afterwards dubbed Polk Place.Borneman, p. 336 The couple progressed down the Atlantic coast, and then westward through the Deep South. He was enthusiastically received and banqueted. By the time the Polks reached Alabama, he was suffering from a bad cold, and soon became concerned by reports of cholera‚Äîa passenger on Polk's riverboat died of it, and it was rumored to be common in New Orleans, but it was too late to change plans. Worried about his health, he would have departed the city quickly, but was overwhelmed by Louisiana hospitality. Several passengers on the riverboat up the Mississippi died of the disease, and Polk felt so ill that he went ashore for four days, staying in a hotel. A doctor assured him he did not have cholera, and Polk made the final leg, arriving in Nashville on April 2 to a huge reception.Borneman, pp. 338‚Äì343 After a visit to James's mother in Columbia, the Polks settled into Polk Place.Borneman, p. 343 The exhausted former president seemed to gain new life, but in early June, he fell ill again, by most accounts of cholera.

It is known for its asexual reproduction and is fissiparous. It is a small starfish, discrete and camouflaged, and occurs in coral reefs in the surf zone of large waves. The species was described in 2006 by Australian marine biologists P. Mark O'Loughlin and Francis Winston Edric Rowe, and gets its name from Chantal Conand. Description It is a very small starfish, less than , with seven or eight short, rounded arms, often irregular in length. This is due to its potential of regeneration, but also to its ability to reproduce through fissiparity. The arms measure in length, and the starfish has multiple madreporites and a single spine on the interradial plates. Solitary papules are present on the top of the starfish. Spikes are present and are rough, granular, and crystalline, and are conical and prominent on the arms. It has an irregular pattern of colours, showing a grey-beige background with granular patterns of reddish or greenish. File:A conandae1.jpgAboral and oral faces. File:A conandae3b.pngA recently divided specimen File:A. conandae4.pngRegenerating specimen (probably after division) File:A. conandae2.jpegRegenerated specimen, with an irregular shape Ecology and behaviour A. conandae reproduces by fission in addition to sexual reproduction, which takes place at the beginning of the summer. The gonopores (genital openings) are located on the upper side, and the observed sex ratio is 52 males per 93 females, but some specimens are hermaphrodites.  Distribution  This species was first spotted at R√©union Island (south- tropical Indian Ocean) at the breakers on a coral reef at a section known as the \\"Watering Hole\\" (south of La Saline les Bains), where it is abundant. It was later identified in all the Mascarenes (mainly Mauritius and Rodrigues), where it occurs between the surface and but more often on the reef front and rocky cliffs, but also on volcanic flows.  Systematics  This species was described in 2006 by P. Mark O'Loughlin and Francis Winston Edric Rowe, on the basis of material collected by Chantal Conand at R√©union Island, after whom it was named. Its type specimen was collected in Trou d'Eau and is located in the National Museum of Natural History of France under the registration \\"IE-2013-2489\\". The genus name Aquilonastra comes from Latin aquilonis (meaning northern), and astra (meaning star), referring to the fact that this genus of starfish is found in the northern part of the Indo-Pacific. A similar species, also fissiparous, was discovered on Europa Island in the Mozambique Channel, and was described in 2013 as Aquilonastra chantalae.

The ECCC seeks to strengthen the day to day emergency care system so that the nation is prepared in times of crisis.  Mission  To lead the United States Government‚Äôs efforts to create an emergency care system that is patient- and community-centered, integrated into the broader healthcare system, high quality, and prepared to respond in times of public health emergencies.  Goals  The ECCC is framed around 4 key goals as described in the mission statement above. # Emergency care systems will be patient- and community-centered. # Emergency care systems will be fully integrated into the health care system. # Emergency care systems will deliver high quality care. # The emergency care system will be prepared to respond in times of disasters and public health emergencies.  Background  In 2006, the Institute of Medicine‚Äôs (IOM) Committee on the Future of Emergency Care in the United States Health System released its findings on the state of the U.S. Emergency Care System in three volumes. The reports, titled Hospital-Based Emergency Care: At the Breaking Point; Emergency Medical Services: At the Crossroads; and Emergency Care for Children: Growing Pains describe a system that is ‚Äúoverburdened,‚Äù ‚Äúunderfunded,‚Äù ‚Äúhighly fragmented,‚Äù and ‚Äúincreasingly unable to appropriately respond to the demands placed upon it each and every day.‚Äù} Recognizing the precarious state of the emergency care in the U.S., the IOM recommended the development of ‚Äúregionalized, coordinated, and accountable emergency care systems throughout the country.‚Äù} The report also recommended that Congress ‚Äúestablish a lead agency for emergency and trauma care‚Ä¶housed in the Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS).‚Äù} Following the IOM report in 2007, Homeland Security Presidential Directive #21 mandated the creation of an office within DHHS that would ‚Äúaddress the full spectrum of issues that have an impact on care in hospital emergency departments, including the entire continuum of patient care from pre-hospital to disposition from emergency or trauma care.‚Äù  Charter  The Emergency Care Coordination Center was established in January 2009 within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in DHHS. The ECCC‚Äôs charter was published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, April 29, 2009.  Organization  The ECCC supports the ASPR mission by focusing federal efforts on improvements to the delivery of daily emergency care that are the foundation of response to disasters and public health emergencies. The ECCC is an essential part of Office of Policy and Planning (OPP), and the Division of Health System Policy (DHSP).  Partners  The ECCC works in close coordination with the Federal Interagency Committee for Emergency Medical Services (FICEMS) and its supporting agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration‚Äôs Office of Emergency Medical Services (EMS). While FICEMS specifically focuses on issues relating to pre-hospital care, the ECCC and FICEMS work together to coordinate and align the efforts of the Federal Government throughout the entire spectrum of the emergency care system.  Current Director  On December 4, 2013, Brendan G. Carr, MD, MA, MS was announced as the director of the ECCC. Dr. Carr is residency trained and board certified in emergency medicine, and completed fellowships in trauma and surgical critical care, as well as in health policy research at the University of Pennsylvania as a part of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation‚Äôs Clinical Scholar program. Dr. Carr‚Äôs research focuses on the association between emergency care system design and outcomes for unplanned critical illness including trauma, stroke, and cardiac arrest. He remains clinically active, caring for patients in the Emergency Department. In 2010, Dr. Carr led a national conference to define the research agenda for regionalized emergency care systems.

She is known for conceptual works using drawing, photography, video, collage, sculpture and performance, which address ‚Äúthe fleeting nature of experience, the elusiveness of desire, and the persistence of objects in a throwaway culture.‚ÄùDonna Gustafson, Curator, Zimmerli Museum, Rutgers University Art critic Jerry Saltz has written that her work \\"not only grappl[es] with consumerism but [she is] just about swallowed whole by it.‚Äù Her work also considers themes of gender identity, narcissism, privacy and information overload. She has exhibited widely throughout the United States and internationally, including a solo exhibition at Yancey Richardson Gallery in 2015, about which art critic Roberta Smith wrote, ‚Äú‚Ä¶obsessive delights await in this strange and beautiful show‚Ä¶‚Äù She lives and works in Gloucester, Massachusetts and Brooklyn, New York.  Education  Rachel Lyman Perry was born in 1962 in Tokyo, Japan to Sarah Hollis Perry and John Curtis Perry She received her BA from Connecticut College in 1984 and a Diploma (2000) and Fifth Year Certificate (2001) from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts.  Career  Perry‚Äôs work can be found in the museum collections of The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Baltimore Museum of Art, Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, the Montclair Art Museum, The Cornell Fine Arts Museum, and the Addison Gallery of American Art, among others. Her first solo museum show, titled was held at the DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park in 2011. Since 2009, Perry has been performing on Twitter, tweeting once per day, every day, the daily life of a working artist in 140 characters exactly. = Rachel Perry Welty 24/7 = In her DeCordova exhibit, titled Rachel Perry Welty 24/7 (on view January 29, 2011 - April 24, 2011) the works included focused on aspects of daily life, or what she calls \\"the business of living,\\" using materials ranging from spam emails and grocery receipts to twist ties and stickers from fruit. The press release for the exhibit described elaborated, \\"mixing a Minimalist aesthetic with Pop humor, Welty's artworks uncover the poetic elements in the everyday.\\" Later in 2011 the exhibit traveled to the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University. = Notable Works = One of Perry's best known works is the video Karaoke Wrong Number (2004) in which the artist lip-syncs to five years of wrong number messages. This work entered the collection of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston in 2007. Other notable works included in her solo exhibit in 2011 at DeCordova include Sticker Paper, a wallpaper collage of fruit stickers, and New and Improved, made up of dry cleaning and grocery store twist ties. In addition to these installation works, she presented a series of photographs titled Lost in my Life, self-portraits in which the artist is nearly camouflaged in sets composed of everyday materials, often featuring other artworks in these images. In 2016, as an Artist-in-Residence at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Perry created a temporary installation for the museum's facade that asked the question \\"What do you really want?\\" The installation was on view from January until June 2016. The question around which the work was centered was the subject line of a spam email Perry received, and she was inspired to make certain formal artistic decisions from materials she encountered in the museum archive during her residency. = Style = Many of Perry's works are deeply personal, since the everyday materials or detritus composed in the pieces were collected by the artist herself, often amassed over periods of several years. In Karaoke Wrong Number, for example, the wrong number voicemails she lip-synced to were left on her phone. and for New and Improved, Perry used twist ties she had been collecting since 1997. Awards and recognition Perry has received numerous awards for her work. She is a two- time winner of the Massachusetts Cultural Council Award (2004 in Drawing; 2009 in Sculpture), and has twice been awarded the Traveling Fellowship from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston for proven excellence. Perry has been named both Catherine Boettcher Fellow and Anne Stark and Kurt Locher Fellow at The MacDowell Colony, and has been Artist-in-Residence in an ongoing program at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum since October 2014.

Cogdon (1950) is a criminal case heard by the Supreme Court of Victoria in Australia where a woman successfully defended herself against a homicide charge using the defence of (non-insane) automatism. The case was not formally reported but the case has been referenced both by legal scholars and those in other disciplines.  Summary of the case  One night, the defendant‚ÄîMrs. Cogdon‚Äîleft her bedroom while sleepwalking. She claims that in this state she saw her 19-year-old daughter Pat being attacked by Korean soldiers. Fearing the worst, while fully in the grip of her sleepwalking, she located an axe and attempted to attack the illusory soldiers. In the process, she killed her daughter. At trial, Mrs. Cogdon pleaded not guilty. The court heard how Pat had suffered from some neurotic conditions which were characterised as relatively minor, and which her psychiatrist had claimed had been cured. Mrs. Cogdon had suffered a number of strange events in the run up to the killing of Pat: she had suffered a nightmare where her house had been invaded by spiders. She believed the spiders were attacking Pat, entered Pat's room and attempted to violently brush said spiders off Pat's face. This woke Pat up. Mrs. Cogdon told Pat she was just tucking her into bed. On the night of Pat's death, Mr. Cogdon was out of the house. Mrs. Cogdon offered to take Pat to see a movie, but Pat could not find a movie she wished to watch in the listings in the newspaper. Pat instead decided to stay in and get an early night. As evidence of Mrs. Cogdon's care for her daughter, it was noted she had prepared a hot water bottle for Pat and a glass of warm milk. At trial, Mr. Cogdon also testified that his wife had an excellent relationship with their daughter: \\"I don't think a mother could have thought any more of her daughter. I think she absolutely adored her.\\"  Decision  Before the Cogdon case, no established case law existed for dealing with automatism defences. The jury found her not guilty.

The business was established in 1975, a year after the presentation, by Fran√ßois Guerbet, of his first prototype at a small town called Montesquieu-Volvestre, some fifteen kilometers south of Toulouse.Linz, Schrader: Die Internationale Automobil-Enzyklop√§die. Cedre was an acronym standing for Centre d‚Äô√âtudes pour la D√©veloppement et la R√©ussite des Entreprises. The Cedre entity formed in 1975 was not a conventional commercial business but a \\"not-for-profit\\" ecologically focused entity, its non-commercial status being defined under the terms of a statute which dated from 1901. Production ended in 1987.  Origins  By 1974 Fran√ßois Guerbet had been fighting for several years to prove that an urban electric car was more than an impossible dream. He believed that using lead-acid battery technology (then the only available option given the amount of charge needed to propel a vehicle) it would be impossible both to match the performance of a \\"normal\\" petrol driven car and achieve a reasonable range between recharging stops. But by restricting the top speed to 50 km/h (31 mph) and using a very light bodied tricycle format vehicle carrying 200 kg of batteries, it should be possible to travel 100 km (61 miles) with a 120 kg load (e.g. a 70 kg person with 50 kg of luggage). In essence, that combination was the blue print for the Midinette which Guerbet first presented on 25 April 1975 at the annual Paris Inventions Fair.  Funding issues  Unfortunately Guerbet did not have the funds available in 1975 to put his electric car into production. He was well provided with persistence, however, and pursued various publicity opportunities, presenting at events such as the International Symposium of Electric Cars at D√ºsseldorf in September 1976 and, subsequently, at a similar event organised by the city of Brussels. Nor was he shy of promoting the Cedre in his own capital, and pictures exist of the Midinette driving along the Champs-√âlys√©es overshadowed, in one of them, by a Fiat 500 and a Mini both of which look quite large when driving beside the little electric single seater. However, in 1977 there was still not the funding to put the Midinette into production. Guerbet's persistence finally paid off and during September 1978 the first customers for the production version of the Midinette were taking delivery of the vehicle which by now was priced by the manufacturer 14,110 francs.The 1970 was a decade of currency depreciation and price inflation: by October 1978 even the basic entry level Citro√´n 2CV was priced by its manufacturer at 14,750 francs. But the basic Citro√´n had four seats whereas the Midinette had one. The next year the little electric vehicle was again a star attraction at the Concours L√©pine (annual Paris Inventions Fair) during the first fortnight on May 1978.  The cars  Guerbet's first car, the electric prototype of 1974, was identified as the Mini 1, and also as the Soubrette The Midinette followed in 1975, and by 1979 had been put into production. It was powered by a 1.2 kW electric motor. Top speed was given as 50 km/h (31 mph), and the range as 60 km (37 miles). The car offered space for one and the plastic/polyester body was accessed through a sliding door on the car's left side. The Midinette was long and wide. The body was fitted on a small tubular chassis and there were three wheels, the single wheel being the one at the front. Despite its rather basic nature, the price quoted for the car was 9,540 francs. (At the 61st Paris Motor Show the previous October the entry level Citro√´n 2CV was priced by its manufacturer at 9,980 francs. The Citro√´n was also a rather basic proposition, but it could seat four in reasonable comfort at a speed (just) above 100 km/h (63 mph).) In 1981 the Midinette was replaced by the Cedre 1000. Top speed was quoted as \\"around 40 km/h\\" (25 mph) but the quoted range between charges was now increased to 120 km (75 mph). A recharging device now enabled the cars to be recharged overnight using a standard domestic power socket, and suitable public recharging points were also beginning to appear at car parks in one or two French cities (though, like the electric cars themselves, the public charging points were at this stage still very rare). The Cedre itself had now grown to a length of , though it was still really only a one seater. The quoted price was now 23,500 francs, so that, as before, a one-seater electric Cedre was advertised for very slightly less than the price of a basic entry level Citro√´n 2CV, now priced by Citro√´n at 23,850 francs. Cedre customers could now specify, as an option extra, solar panels on the roof of the Cedre which increased \\"driver autonomy\\", on a sunny day adding around 20 km (12 miles) to the distance that could be covered between charges. There was also a model for which maximum output was given as 5 kW. A special model was presented called the 5x5 Solaire.

His parents were Maria Cracroft Weston (n√©e Hill) and Thomas S. Weston, and judge and later a member of the House of Representatives for electorates on the West Coast of the South Island. Claude Weston received his secondary education at Christ's College and graduated with LL.B. from the Canterbury University College. Weston was a Captain of the Taranaki Rifles. Together with his elder brother Thomas Shailer Weston Jr., he took over his father's legal practice in November 1902, with offices in New Plymouth, Inglewood, and Waitara. Their firm was known as Weston & Weston. He was appointed crown prosecutor in 1915. In the same year, he joined the Wellington Infantry Battalion and embarked on 14 August for Suez in Egypt. He became a lieutenant- colonel and was awarded a Distinguished Service Order in the 1918 New Year Honours.

In 2013, the Crown Law Office published a list of King's and Queen's Counsel appointed since 1907, but Weston is missing from that list, and according to the Law Society, he is the only omission on the official list. By coincidence, a Claude Weston from Sydney, New South Wales was appointed King's Counsel just a month earlier. Whilst they were not related, they later met. Political activity The United Party (known as the Liberal Party until 1927, except for a short period between 1925 and 1927 when it used the name \\"National Party\\") and the Reform Party were in a coalition, known as the United‚ÄìReform Coalition, since . Weston was one of the key figures who organised a conference for 13 and 14 May 1936. Together with two others, he drew up a draft constitution prior to the conference, and he was chosen as chairman for the conference. The outcome was the formation of the New Zealand National Party through the merger of United and Reform. At the conference, Weston proposed Sir George Wilson as the party's president, and the motion was carried. Within a week, Wilson was forced to make a decision between the presidency or a directorship of the New Zealand Insurance Company, and Wilson decided in favour of the commercial appointment. The presidency thus transferred to Weston, who had the task of overseeing the establishment of the party's Dominion organisation, and he was one of the trustees of the party's periodical, The National News. Whilst The National News performed an important part during the party's formative years, the venture was expensive and following the , it was changed to a quarterly schedule, before being discontinued in September 1939 just after the outbreak of the war. The seven- member Dominion publicity committee, of which Weston was a member, engaged three advertising companies to jointly prepare for the 1938 election. Two of those companies, John Ilott and Charles Haines, remained joint agents for the National Party until 1973. Weston was succeeded as president by Alex Gordon in 1940. Weston was also the first chairman of the Wellington Division of the National Party (1936‚Äì1937). In the , Weston was a candidate for the National Party in the electorate. He died suddenly on 10 November 1946 in Wellington and was replaced as a candidate by his wife, Agnes Louisa Weston. The election was won by Charles Henry Chapman of the Labour Party. His wife was later appointed onto the New Zealand Legislative Council as part of the suicide squad. Weston was New Zealand consul to the Netherlands and was appointed Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau. Family Weston married in 1905. His wife was born Agnes Louisa Steuart, the daughter of Fred J. Steuart, who was at one time Mayor of Stratford. The funeral service for Weston was held at St. Paul's Cathedral, after which he was cremated. His wife died in 1972 and was also cremated. His daughter, Claudia Lillian Weston, trained to become a medical doctor. On 8 February 1937, she married Tom Shand, who became a member of the House of Representatives in the 1946 election for the electorate.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013 was introduced at the same time as the Baseline Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 1871; 113th Congress) and the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress) as a package of budget reform bills. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013 would amend the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (CBA) to require the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to prepare for each major bill or resolution reported by any congressional committee (except the congressional appropriations committees), as a supplement to CBO cost estimates, a macroeconomic impact analysis of the budgetary effects of such legislation for the 10-fiscal year period beginning with the first fiscal year for which such estimate was prepared and each of the next three 10-fiscal year periods. The bill would define \\"major bill or resolution\\" as any bill or resolution whose budgetary effects, for any fiscal year in the period for which a CBO cost estimate is prepared, is estimated to be greater than .25% of the current projected U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) for that fiscal year. The bill would require the analysis to describe: (1) the potential economic impact of the bill or resolution on major economic variables, including real GDP, business investment, the capital stock, employment, interest rates, and labor supply; and (2) the potential fiscal effects of the measure, including any estimates of revenue increases or decreases resulting from changes in GDP. The bill would require the analysis (or a technical appendix to it) to specify the economic and econometric models used, sources of data, relevant data transformations, as well as any explanation necessary to make the models comprehensible to academic and public policy analysts. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Budget on June 19, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 1874 would require the Congressional Budget Office to provide a macroeconomic impact analysis for bills that are estimated to have a large budgetary effect. Under H.R. 1874, the CBO would be required to provide‚Äîto the extent practicable‚Äîan analysis of the impact on the economy of any bill that would have an estimated budgetary effect of greater than 0.25 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in any fiscal year. (Currently, that threshold would be about $40 billion, based on GDP of about $16 trillion.) The macroeconomic analysis would include the estimated effect on revenues and outlays of a change in GDP resulting from the legislation being evaluated. The bill also would require CBO to publicly provide the assumptions and models underlying those analyses. The CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 1874 would cost about $2 million over the 2014-2018 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. Enacting H.R. 1874 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you- go procedures do not apply. H.R. 1874 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on May 8, 2013, by Rep. Tom Price (R, GA-6). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on the Budget and the United States House Committee on Rules. It was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-161 part 1 on July 19, 2014. Debate and discussion Rep. Paul Ryan supported the bill, saying that this bill and several related reform bills \\"are an important step toward restoring fiscal discipline in Washington.\\" Ryan said that he thought \\"by improving the budget process, we can get a better handle on our spending problem.\\" Rep. Tom Price, who introduced the bill, said it was necessary because the Congressional Budget Office's current method of reviewing bills just to see what they would cost. Price said \\"that is a model that has proven to be incapable of providing the type of macroeconomic diagnosis folks need to make sure we are pursuing policies that will help generate economic opportunity and bring down the nation's debt.\\" The organization Americans for Prosperity supported the bill, arguing that requiring the CBO to use \\"dynamic scoring it its reports\\" would \\"give Congress a more realistic estimate of the fiscal impact of federal legislation.\\" Americans For Prosperity argued that under the current system, which \\"fails to account for how the economy will react to new policies\\" such as higher taxes, there is a bias \\"in favor of big-government policies.\\" Democrats on the House Budget Committee criticized the bill, writing that dynamic scoring is \\"a methodology favored by Republicans because its subjective nature lends itself to the make-believe theory that tax breaks for the wealthy pay for themselves due to trickle-down economics.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Dynamic scoring Notes/References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 1874 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 1874 *GovTrack.us H.R. 1874 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 1874 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 1874 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013"},{"id":"42337264","text":"Anthony Anderson is an Australian film and television producer, a former lawyer, meditation teacher and a transformational facilitator.

They have had their songs featured on television shows such as CSI, NCIS New Orleans, The Good Wife, Blue Bloods, and the aptly-named TV movie Lizzie Borden Took An Axe. The duo has no plans to slow down. They are on a continuing journey, constantly finding inspiration from musicians they meet or collaborate with.

Yuvan Shankar Raja composed the soundtrack and score for the film, while cinematography and editing were handled by Priyan and V. T. Vijayan, respectively. The film was officially launched on 28 March 2014 with a first look release, and principal photography began on 18 April 2014. The film released on 22 October 2014 on the occasion of Diwali.

Plot Vasudevan aka Vasu (Vishal) is a Coimbatore-based moneylender and also the heir to the Kovai Group, a cloth manufacturing conglomerate, until he was disowned by his mother and matriarch of his joint family Rajalakshmi (Raadhika) due to some misunderstanding. He meets a rich girl named Divya (Shruthi Haasan) at a mall, who soon falls in love with him for his good nature. One day, Vasu saves the Additional Superintendent of Police for Coimbatore District Sivakkozhundhu (Sathyaraj) and his wife (Aishwarya) from a group of thugs who work for Anna Thandavam (Mukesh Tiwari), a Pollachi-based businessman and contract killer who kills anyone to acquire their land and money. As Sivakkozhundhu was transferred to Coimbatore district to capture Anna Thandavam, the latter had planned to kill him. Anna Thandavam also plans to illegally grab land sold to a village temple by Vasu's late father Rathnaswamy (Raghuvaran). These two incidents cause enmity between Vasu and Anna Thandavam. Vasu reconciles with the rest of his family and returns home. When the land is formally sold to the temple, an irate Anna Thandavam assaults Vasu's uncle Ramaswamy (Jayaprakash), following which Vasu beats him up in retaliation and breaks his hand.

It originates in the Chhindwara district of Madhya Pradesh and flows across Pench National Park, which is a reserve for the Tiger Project of India. The two big dams of the Pench River supply water to the city of Nagpur and to the big thermal power plant located there. Pench National Park The river separates Pench National Park into two halves, east and west Pench. The Pench Tiger Reserve derives its name after the Pench River, which flows from north to south across the reserve. The reserve is situated on the south of the Satpura Hill Ranges in the Seoni District and Chhindwara District in the Madhya Pradesh state of India. The topography is undulating, with most of the area enclosed by small hill ranges and abrupt slopes on all the sides. The Pench river flowing through the centre of the Reserve is usually dry by April, but a number of water pools, locally known as dohs, are found along the course of the river. These serve as waterholes for wild animals. A few perennial springs also exist in the region. Recently, a number of earthen ponds and shallow wells have been created, providing well-distributed sources of water across the reserve. Dam The hydroelectric Totladoh Dam on the Pench River was the first interstate project of Maharashtra. It is located in the Pench National Park. The next big dam is Pench Dam near just downstream of the Totladoh Dam the town of Navegaon Khairy located in Parseoni Taluka. More than 70% of the drinking water in Nagpur is supplied from the dams. The Pench right canal supplies water to Nagpur, the Koradi Thermal Power Station, and the Khaparkheda Thermal Power Station, and the rest of the water is use for irrigation in Parseoni taluka, Kalmeshwar taluka, Savner taluka, Kamthi taluka, and rural Nagpur. The Pench left canal irrigates Parseoni taluka, Ramtek taluka, and Mauda taluka and provides water for the NTPC Mauda Super Thermal Power Station and other industrial purposes.

The band's two core members were Paul Knowles and Nicole Storto. They released four studio albums, all on Big Barn Records. History Knowles, who is the son of a Baptist preacher and who grew up in Morristown, Tennessee, met Storto, a former tennis star at San Diego State University, at a record store in Tempe, Arizona in 1997. They then moved to Sedona. After recording demos for a few years, they moved to Chicago because they viewed it as a \\"music town\\", where they premiered their act, originally called \\"Drowning Noah,\\" in 1999. After changing their name to Mars Arizona in 2000, they released an album called \\"Mars Arizona\\" later the same year, as an MP3, a name which they chose to reference the otherworldly appearance of Northern Arizona. Their decision to change their band's name was made after a woman from Texas drowned both her children‚Äîone of whom was named Noah‚Äîso Knowles and Storto wouldn't be perceived as \\"making light of a tragedy.\\" Their debut album as Mars Arizona, Love Songs for the Apocalypse, was released on November 12, 2002. Knowles joked that, in making the album, one of his and Storto's goals was \\"to get all ‚Äòone star‚Äô reviews in every music magazine in the country.\\" Nevertheless, Stephen Haag of PopMatters wrote that the album \\"...isn‚Äôt a one star album‚Äîaccomplishing that feat usually requires mountains of cocaine (hello, Aerosmith‚Äôs Rock in a Hard Place!)‚Äîbut rather a safe, pleasant enough, middle of the road album.\\" For their second album, All Over the Road, the duo recruited drummer Kenny Aronoff, who was previously known for his work with John Mellencamp. They recorded the album in the Bay Area cities of Mill Valley and Cotati, California. After the album was released on July 12, 2005, it received a favorable review from Country Standard Time's Andy Turner, who concluded that it was \\"a non-flashy, smartly done effort well worth checking out.\\" Robert Christgau also reviewed the album, labeling \\"Elvis Presley Blues\\", which is a cover of a Gillian Welch song, a \\"choice cut\\". This rating indicates that, according to Christgau, only certain songs‚Äîthe \\"choice cut(s)\\"‚Äîon the album are good, but that the rest of the album \\"isn't worth your time or money.\\" It was also reviewed by Rick Cornell for the magazine No Depression, who noted that the album \\"is largely about loss and recovery,\\" describing it as \\"an eclectic mix, from the rocked-up honky-tonk of the title track (a tribute to Mike Flannagan, a late Knoxville DJ whose radio show gives the album its title) to the half-classic-country/half-folk feel of ‚ÄúStreets Of Milwaukee‚Äù to the keyboard-pop leanings of the closing pair ‚ÄúGoodbye Peace‚Äù and ‚ÄúGood Morning‚Äù. Other moderately favorable reviews came from J. Poet of AllMusic, who awarded the album 3 1/2 stars out of 5, and Noel Murray, who wrote that on the song \\"He Broke Your Heart,\\" \\"sweetly buzzing guitar counteracts Knowles' bitter words.\\" Murray also wrote that \\"If Mars Arizona stays the course, the band could rival its down-the-coast neighbor Limbeck, which over five years and three LPs has become one of the brightest hopes for roots-rock.\\" Their third album, Hello Cruel World, was released on January 15, 2008 and, like their previous album, includes appearances by several famous musicians. This time, these musicians included David Grisman, Al Perkins, and Billy Block. Knowles attributed some of the album's positive critical reception to the appearance of these well-known musicians. The band toured in support of it soon after its release, playing at, among other places, \\"Muddy Waters\\" in Santa Barbara, California. In an interview, Knowles said it was influenced by \\"Northern California and Nashville--not traditional, but underground Nashville.\\" Soon after its release, the album rose to #32 on the Americana Music Association's AMA Radio Chart. Like All Over the Road, Hello Cruel World was reviewed in No Depression, where Greg Yost wrote that, on the album, the band \\"manages to find the proverbial silver lining of good music while also conveying an overall sense of global disillusionment.\\" Also like All Over the Road, it received a 3.5 star review from AllMusic's J. Poet. Their fourth and final album, High Desert, was released on May 18, 2010. As with all of Mars Arizona's previous albums, AllMusic's J. Poet reviewed this album, which he again gave a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars. J. Poet also reviewed the album favorably in the newspaper East Bay Express, in which he described it as \\"still country, albeit an evolved form\\" and described \\"Jesus Ain't Coming Back\\" as an album highlight. On April 9, 2013, Knowles and Storto released their first album under their new moniker, New American Farmers, entitled \\"Brand New Day\\". They released their second album under this moniker, The Farmacology Sessions, the following year.

The original name of the street was Sub Janiculensis or Sub Jano, while the pilgrims coming to Rome to visit St. Peter's Basilica called it Via Sancta. It was later known as Via Julia, just like the street of the same name on the opposite bank of the Tiber, although Pope Julius II didn't create the street (this credit goes to Pope Alexander VI), but just adapted it. Finally, the name was changed to Via della Lungara, that refers to its great length.

He is also the founder of St. Mark Holiness Church in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, and a North Carolina Arts Council Folk Heritage Award winner. Biography Dready Manning was born in Northampton County, North Carolina, United States, in the farming community of Gaston. Mirrored at By the age of eight he was orphaned. He went to live with his aunt's family of sharecroppers who grew cotton, peanuts, and corn. Some of his uncles and cousins played blues guitar in the North Carolina Piedmont fashion. When Manning was seven years old, he began learning how to fingerpick guitar. His skills improved over time and by his teenage years Manning had earned a reputation as a master of blues guitar and harmonica.Scott Sharpe, \\"The Bishop Rocks the House,\\" The News & Observer, 16 March 2003. His style was influenced by Piedmont blues musicians such as Blind Boy Fuller, Brownie McGhee and Buddy Moss, and national stars like Lightnin' Hopkins, Jimmy Reed and Sonny Boy Williamson As a young bluesman, Manning played in clubs and sold moonshine. Having been drinking abundantly, in 1962 Manning developed esophageal varices that caused unstoppable bleeding from his nose. Some family members and neighbors, who were members of a local Holiness church, prayed over him, using the Christian ritual of laying on hands. When Manning heard their prayers, he felt the bleeding stop. He had \\"a converted mind right then\\", disavowed the blues and pledged to use his musical talents to serve God. He and his wife, known as Mother Marie, joined the Holiness congregation. Three years later they moved in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, and branched a St. Mark Holiness church, opening in 1975. Manning began composing sacred songs, performing for prayer meetings and revivals, and releasing gospel recordings. With his wife and their six children he developed a distinctive gospel sound by the late 1960s. Marie Manning has been singing powerful old-time gospel while Bishop Manning has been playing hard-driving guitar. Along with their five children they formed the Manning Family gospel singers, featuring different family members as vocalists. Starting circa 1970, Bishop Manning has recorded gospel 45s on Jimmy Capps' JCP,\\"Sit Down Servant\\" by The Gospel Four Memorial Records, Hoyt Sullivan's Su-Ann, and on his own labels Manning, B.L.M., Peatock, and Nashbrand. Some of these were reissued in 2011 in a set by Fat Possum Records' Big Legal Mess subsidiary called Converted Mind. In 1996 a CD, \\"Take One Moment At A Time\\" came out, which presents a more modern sound, and in 1997 records under his name were released by ShurFine/Pastor Records. Through the Music Maker Relief Foundation, he recorded the album Gospel Train (2005), where he turned to play an acoustic guitar and harmonica. Manning has also been a long-time host of a Sunday morning radio show on WSMY in Weldon, North Carolina. Bishop Manning's grown children now take the lead when he performs with his family, but Manning continues to play at St. Mark Holiness Church and St. Mark Mission in Scotland Neck, North Carolina. Recognition In 2003, Bishop Manning won a North Carolina Arts Council Folk Heritage Award.\\"N.C. Arts Council Folk Heritage Award Recipients,\\" The News & Observer, 20 April 2003.

Initially there were 506 students. The 1962 Student Council sponsored the vote, decided by students and faculty, for the school colors and mascot. There were 640 students and 30 faculty members by the end of the 1965‚Äì1966 school year. It served African American children until 1970. The school's name and grade configuration changed multiple times up until the 1980s. The school was known as Northside School from fall 1970 until spring 1971, then Havana High School from Spring 1971 until fall of 1980, when the school began using its final name. The school's grade configuration was changed to 6‚Äì9 in fall 1970, but became 9-12 by fall 1971. From fall 1981 to 1988 the school included 8th graders, but after that point it remained a 9-12 school. According to Gerald Ensley of the Tallahassee Democrat, by 2003 the condition of the school caused many families to send their children to Leon County Schools campuses and/or to private schools.Ensley, Gerald.

The school district stopped using the building of Havana Northside, which in its final year had 350 students, altogether. Brian Miller of the Tallahassee Democrat stated that the 2000s high school mergers damaged the school athletic spirit in the county as the former school identities were discarded.

Early life and career Griffiths was born in Aberystwyth and received his early education at Penparcau National School. Although apprenticed as a bookbinder and ironmonger in his native town, he soon moved to Blaina. Monmouthshire, where he became a pupil teacher. After five years he earned a scholarship to Bangor Normal College where he was one of the first students and a contemporary of John Rhys. Having qualified as a teacher, he first taught at Hirwaun and later at Beaufort, and during his time there he won several prizes at eisteddfodau. In 1866 he left Beaufort for Aberaman and during his time there became involved in Liberal politics and campaigned for Henry Richard at the 1868 General Election. Griffiths at Penygraig In 1872 Griffiths left Aberaman for Penygraig where he succeeded Tom John as headmaster of the National Schools. During his time at Penygraig a number of explosions took place at the Penygraig Naval collieries and Griffiths played prominent role in efforts to raise funds for widows and orphans. He retired from his post in 1885 and thereafter devoted himself to public life. At the 1885 General Election he actively supported F.L. Davis in his unsuccessful campaign against William Abraham (Mabon). He was, however, unsuccessful in his attempt to secure election to the Ystradyfodwg School Board in 1890. Religion In 1884 he was made a deacon at Pisgah Calvinistic Methodist Chapel, Penygraig. He may also be founder of many of the English Presbyterian churches in the Rhondda and often filled their pulpits on Sundays and was said to have a particular talent for adapting the gospel to attract the listeners.

At the inaugural Glamorgan County Council election in 1889 he was elected councillor for Porth and was immediately made an alderman. He was re-elected councillor for Porth and Penygraig, and again made an alderman, both in 1895 and 1901. He died at his home in Penygraig on 30 June 1901. His funeral was held at Llethr-ddu Cemetery on 11 July.

Montgomery Gregory, a native of Washington, D.C., was key in cultivating and nurturing the concept of a National Negro Theatre Movement during the early decades of the 20th century against the backdrop of an 80-year-old minstrel tradition and the popularity of Black-themed dramatic works by white writers, underscored by the commercially fledgling efforts of Black playwrights in America.  The Howard Players  At Howard University, Gregory founded the acclaimed college theater troupe, The Howard Players. Formerly, the University‚Äôs theatre interests were served by the College Dramatic Club, developed in 1909 by English instructor Ernest Just and a group of students. Gregory was the organizer of the Howard University Department of Dramatic Art and Public Speaking in 1921 and co- creator with Alain Locke of The Stylus literary club. Gregory was appointed the first director of the drama department and was joined in his efforts by acting coach Marie Moore Forrest, and stage designer Cleon Throckmorton of the Provincetown Players. The department‚Äôs course in Pageantry and Drama was the first of its kind in the U.S. to be offered for credit. Through his work at Howard, Gregory generated national interest in legitimate Black drama, collaborating with important playwrights such as Willis Richardson, Paul Green, and Eugene O'Neill, and creating, via The Howard Players, a critically acclaimed forum for student-written plays and performances. George Pierce Baker of the 47 Workshop at Harvard University cited The Howard Players as one of the two most creative college theatre companies in the United States, with The Carolina Playmakers of the University of North Carolina being the other.\\"Howard Players Appear In Their Own Show,\\" The Chicago Defender( national Edition, June 3, 1922. pg. 5  Early life  Gregory was educated at Williston Seminary (1902-1906), then Harvard University, graduating in the celebrated Class of 1910 which included T. S. Eliot, Walter Lippmann and John Reed. His father, James Monroe Gregory, who transferred from Oberlin College in 1868 to become the first student enrolled in Howard University‚Äôs College Department, was in the university‚Äôs first graduating class of three men, and stayed on as a member of the faculty. His mother, Fannie Emma Hagan, a former Howard student of Madagascan descent, was an independent-minded woman, who, while a Howard faculty spouse, mentored young students and devoted much of her life to the up-liftment of ‚Äúcolored women.‚Äù The family‚Äôs home on the Howard campus stood on the present site of the Ira Aldridge Theatre. The elder Gregory was instrumental in acquiring the first significant Congressional endowment for Howard. In 1897, the James Monroe Gregory family left Washington, D.C. for Bordentown, New Jersey, where Professor Gregory took the helm of the Bordentown Industrial and Manual Training School. In 1910, after completing his studies at Harvard University, Montgomery Gregory was appointed English Instructor at Howard, rising quickly to Professor and, in 1919, Head of department. In 1918, he married Hugh Ella Hancock of Austin, Texas. Their offspring were writer/poet Yvonne (deceased), Thomas Montgomery, Jr. (deceased), Hugh Hancock (deceased), Eugene Chandler (deceased), Mignon (deceased), and writer/former television producer Sheila Gregory Thomas, who resides in Washington, D.C. In 1919, Gregory organized The Howard Players, and in 1921 became the first director of the newly organized division of Dramatic Art and Public Speaking. \\"During the period from 1919 to 1925, drama at the university reached a peak both financially and technically.\\"2 It was during those years that Gregory began orchestrating his dream of a National Negro Theatre.\\"College Debate Result,\\" New York Times, March 27, 1909, pg.2  Early career  Early in Gregory's career, he began to formulate the notion that the Black race could, and should necessarily, use the arts as a means for social change. He articulated his \\"empowerment through artistic achievement\\" framework in \\"Race in Art,\\" an article for The Citizen, a Boston-based magazine, published in 1915 by Charles F. Lane, with Gregory, George W. Ellis, and William Stanley Braithwaite serving as editorial board members. \\"If art is self-expression, it is necessarily race expression,\\" wrote Gregory. Not only had the Black race in America suffered from the perception of intellectual and artistic inferiority, Gregory argues in this lengthy treatise, but Black leaders of the period, he wrote, undermined Black ascendancy by advancing a negative \\"race attitude,\\" while encouraging Black people to mimic the tone and texture of Euro-Americanism: In March 1921, after successful runs of works by Lord Dunsany (‚ÄúThe Lost Silk Hat‚Äù) and Booth Tarkington (‚ÄúBeauty and the Jacobean‚Äù), as well as other productions, Gregory aroused the interest of national theater critics with a performance of Eugene O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs \\"The Emperor Jones\\" before a non-segregated audience at the Shubert-Belasco Theatre in Washington, D.C. Most extraordinary was the presence of Charles Gilpin, America‚Äôs most celebrated Negro actor of the period, recreating the title role for which he, that same year, had been named one of the ten best actors for his performance in O'Neill's New York production of the play. The Howard Players performed as the supporting cast before \\"an audience that was far less in numbers than merited. ‚Ä¶\\" Although \\"Jones\\" was the product of a white playwright‚Äôs vision of a tragic Black figure, Gregory saw the work as an important vehicle toward a sustained, legitimate Negro-centered theater. \\"...for the histrionic ability of Charles Gilpin has been as effective as the dramatic genius of Eugene O'Neill ‚Äì the serious play of Negro life broke through to public favor and critical recognition.\\" With the notion of introducing the evolving artistry of the Negro to the world stage, in 1921 Gregory also organized a performance of Ridgely Torrence's ‚ÄúSimon, the Cyrenian‚Äù by the Howard Players for the delegates to the World Disarmament Conference. The meritorious events, however, were but steps toward Gregory's National Negro Theatre, for which he groomed young Negro dramatists to provide plays in which Black actors could present Black themes largely for the benefit of Blacks, however, played outside \\"established theaters in the Negro districts, for that would tend to prevent the white community from seeing their art‚Ä¶\\"  Influence on Social Change  Gregory's contradictions between his \\"race attitude\\" dissertation and his efforts to market Black theatre to white audiences in an attempt to create social change, are immutable considerations. On this score, his steady promotion of Black-authored plays of Negro life gives pause for discussion. Consider Gregory's review of Jessie Fauset‚Äôs novel, There is Confusion (1924). Here he appears, exclusively, to advocate ‚Äî at least on the consumer end ‚Äî Black art, primarily, for Black audiences: \\"If our poets, novelists, and dramatists are to succeed we must form a large reading public for the products of their pens. Let the slogan be: Read the works of our own writers first!‚Äù7 The range of Gregory‚Äôs ideas and influences were also evident in his work with Howard's student dramatists. \\"[At Howard University] an attempt is being made to build a structure of native Negro drama, to be interpreted by people of that race,\\" wrote Leonard Hall, a Washington D.C. theater critic, citing the works of then-student Helen Webb (‚ÄúGenefrede‚Äù), and Howard alumna De Reath Irene Byrd Beausey (‚ÄúThe Yellow Tree‚Äù), as cornerstones of an emerging \\"native Negro drama.\\"Poet, playwright, anthologist, and educator May Miller, daughter of Kelly Miller, a Howard University scholar and administrator, also enjoyed relative success under Gregory‚Äôs tutelage with a Players production of ‚ÄúWithin the Shadow‚Äù in 1920. Writer/choreographer Lottie Beatrice Graham (Ottie B. Graham), another member of the drama program and Gregory‚Äôs student, wrote at least two of her one-act plays while in his class, ‚ÄúThe King‚Äôs Carpenters‚Äù (1921), which appeared in The Stylus, and ‚ÄúHoliday,‚Äù later published in Crisis.  The Negro in Drama  In 1927, Gregory contributed ‚ÄúThe Negro in Drama‚Äù to the 14th edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. In late winter, Gregory and Locke‚Äôs Plays of Negro Life was published. The collection of twenty-two works by well-and lesser- known playwrights includes Howard drama student Thelma Myrtle Duncan's \\"The Death Dance\\" and works by Georgia Douglas Johnson, Jean Toomer, Eulalie Spence, Willis Richardson, Richard Bruce, John Matheus, Ernest H. Culbertson, Paul Green, and Eugene O'Neill, with illustrations by artist Aaron Douglas. Both Gregory and Locke refer to themselves in Plays as \\"formally Professor of ‚Ä¶,\\" an ironic gesture since both men had, at some point in their careers, been \\"encouraged\\" or forced to leave the university.  Later life  Gregory‚Äôs resignation was tendered in 1912 after an anonymous letter to the University's president accused the 23-year-old professor of a drunken display at a Washington D.C. bar. A \\"who's who\\" army of Gregory defenders, which included longtime friend William A. Sinclair and Booker T. Washington, gracefully negotiated on the young professor's behalf. Gregory was reinstated the following year. A second and final resignation came eleven years later, in August 1924, when Gregory opted for a position as Supervisor of Negro Schools, and later Principal, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which offered \\"a broader field of service and a very considerable increase of salary.\\"10 Locke exited the university the following year, returning at a later time. In New Jersey, Gregory continued to promote Negro drama. In 1929 he undertook a tour of the South lecturing at eight State summer schools on educational and community drama. In 1956, he retired, and in 1960 returned to Washington. Gregory died after a long battle with leukemia, in Washington's Sibley Hospital, November 21, 1971. \\"T.M.

Political career He joined Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) in 1988, and served as President of the party's B√©k√©s County branch between 1992 and 2002. He was a local representative in the Assembly of Orosh√°za from 1990 to 1994, and functioned as head of the MDF group.

Varga announced his resignation as board chair within hours. Controversy In September 2012, Varga made controversial remarks on domestic violence during a parliamentary debate. He said there would be no domestic violence if Hungarian women had four or five children instead of only one or two. After that, several NGOs staged a demonstration on Kossuth t√©r to draw attention to violence against women, and to speak up for women's rights more generally. Following the outcry, Fidesz lawmakers decided that parliament should decide about incorporating domestic violence into the country's new Penal Code as a separate offence, a demand signed by 105,000 people in an initiative.

It can either be a national patent, or a European patent granted under the European Patent Convention (EPC) and having a unitary character pursuant to . The unitary patent \\"may only be granted, transferred, annulled or lapse in respect of the whole territory of protection,\\" i.e. for both Switzerland and Liechtenstein.Article 4(1) of the Treaty of 22 December 1978 The special agreement establishing this unitary patent is the Treaty between the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on Patent Protection of 22 December 1978, which entered into force on 1 April 1980. This special agreement is also a regional patent agreement within the meaning of . Amongst the bilateral treaties concluded between Switzerland and Liechtenstein in the field of patents, the Patent Treaty of 22 December 1978 is considered to be the most important one. A European patent may only be granted jointly in respect of Switzerland and Liechtenstein, following a joint designation under .Article 2 of the Treaty of 22 December 1978 The unitary patent for Switzerland and Liechtenstein is the only unitary patent under Article 142(1) EPC being currently in force. The agreement underlying the EU unitary patent, that would be valid in participating member states of the European Union, has been signed but is not in force, as of October 2019.  Background  Patents granted under the European Patent Convention (EPC) are called European patents. Those are granted following a unified grant procedure based on a single patent application, in one language. After grant however, a European patent is not a unitary right, but becomes a bundle of essentially independent nationally-enforceable, nationally-revocable patents ‚Äìsubject to central revocation or narrowing as a group pursuant to two types of unified, post- grant procedures: a time-limited opposition procedure, which can be initiated by any person except the patent proprietor, and limitation and revocation procedures, which can be initiated by the patent proprietor only. Until the entry into force of the Patent Treaty between Switzerland and Liechtenstein on 1 April 1980, Swiss patents could be also enforced in Liechtenstein, which at that time did not grant its own patents. This had been made possible by a regulation unilaterally enacted in 1924 by Liechtenstein, but considered only as a temporary measure. The legal situation was unsatisfactory. In the 1970s, when both the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and the European Patent Convention (EPC) were signed and came into effect, to which Liechtenstein wished to participate, Liechtenstein had to either enact its own patent law or sign a regional patent treaty with Switzerland. Liechtenstein chose the latter possibility.  Joint designation and unitary character  A European patent may only be granted jointly in respect of Switzerland and Liechtenstein, following a joint designation under Article 149 EPC. Upon filing a European patent application, an applicant cannot choose to designate Switzerland without designating Liechtenstein, or Liechtenstein without designating Switzerland. The designation of one of the two countries is deemed to be a designation of both. This also meant, for European patent applications filed before 1 April 2009 (before the introduction of an all-inclusive designation fee payable for all EPC contracting states), that a single joint designation fee was payable for Switzerland and Liechtenstein.: \\"Designation fee; time limits\\" After grant, the European patent in force in Switzerland and Liechtenstein‚Äîin the same manner as a \\"national\\" patent in Switzerland and Liechtenstein‚Äî has a truly unitary character. It can only be transferred, revoked or lapse for both states at the same time. It has also the same effect in both countries. The Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property is the only competent national authority regarding the unitary patent for Switzerland and Liechtenstein. An international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) can also only jointly designate Switzerland and Liechtenstein under . Based on an international application, it is possible to obtain a unitary patent in Switzerland and Liechtenstein by entering either into the European regional phase (therefore leading to a Euro-PCT application, which is essentially the same as a direct European patent application) or into the national phase.  Grant procedures  The unitary patent in Switzerland and Liechtenstein can either be a European patent granted under the European Patent Convention (EPC), or a national patent. The procedure leading to the grant of a European patent and the procedure leading to the grant of a \\"national\\" patent in Switzerland and Liechtenstein are, however, different. The European Patent Office (EPO) is in charge of granting European patents. The grant procedure before the EPO is administrative procedure, which notably involves a substantive examination of the European patent application, in accordance with the legal provisions of the European Patent Convention (EPC). In contrast, the grant procedure for \\"national\\" patents in Switzerland and Liechtenstein takes place before the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property and does not involve a substantial examination. No examination takes place as to whether the claimed invention is new and inventive. The patent is granted provided that certain formal requirements are fulfilled. It is possible to obtain a search report during the procedure, but this is optional and has no effect on the decision to grant. =Languages= While the language of the proceedings at the European Patent Office may only be English, French or German,: \\"Language of the proceedings\\" the proceedings before the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property, for the grant of a \\"national\\" patent, are conducted in German, French or Italian. As Switzerland and Liechtenstein are parties to the London Agreement, no translation is required for a European patent to remain effective after grant in these two countries. Jurisdiction In Switzerland, the Federal Patent Court has exclusive jurisdiction over validity and infringement disputes, preliminary measures and enforcement of decisions made under its exclusive jurisdiction. The patent court started its work in 2012, taking over jurisdiction from 26 individual cantonal courts and consists of panels of both legally and technically qualified judges. In Liechtenstein, the Princely High Court (German: f√ºrstliche Obergericht) was designated as court of single instance in civil cases regarding patents. Appeal is possible (with regard to legal issues) to the Federal Supreme Court, both for Swiss and Liechtenstein court actions.

This poetry was often delivered by a professional reciter called a reacaire (reciter) or marcach duaine (poem rider). It was the specialised production of the professional poets known as Filidh (Seer). The complexities of the structure becomes more understandable when we consider that Irish poetry evolved primarily as an orally transmitted art. They were not intended to be read, but recited in public. Form, structure, rhythm and rhyme, intonation, and expression all play an essential part of the performance of poets. The aim was to amaze an audience with vocal virtuosity, knowledge, and spiritual depth. In this they must have succeeded as the Filidh came to be viewed with a sense of awe, respect and fear. The formal production of D√°n Direach by trained poets came to an end with the destruction of Irish Gaelic society due to the Plantations of Ireland in the 17th century. However, the forms continued in folk memory as chants, prayers and informally delivered lays that continued to be recited in Gaelic speaking areas of Ireland and Scotland into the early 20th century. Gaelic poetical culture may have continued to influence Caribbean and African American forms of singing in the 17th and 18th century when the language was spoken by immigrants in the Caribbean and American south. Many hundreds of poems are still extant as they were collected into poem books called Duanaire by wealthy patrons. History Rhyme has an old history of sophisticated development in Ireland. It was not a feature of Classical Greek or Latin verse. There is some reason to believe that Ireland brought developed forms of rhyme into other European cultures through the influence of the literate monks and foundations created by them across northern Europe. The development of D√°n Direach seems to coincide with the rise of the secular schools in the 12th century. Families that had their roots in the great monastic literary tradition appear to have continued the learned tradition outside the strictly religious environment of the monasteries after the reform of the Irish church in the 12th century. The √ì D√°laigh family of bards were considered to be the foremost exponents of D√°n Direach throughout the later Medieval period.Rigby, p. 578 Performance An eyewitness account \\"The Action and Pronunciation of the Poems, in the Presence of the Maecenas (Chief), or the principal Person it related to, was perform'd with a great deal of Ceremony, in a Consort of Vocal and Instrumental Musick. The poet himself said nothing, but directed and took care that every body else did his Part right. The Bards having first had the Composition from him, got it well by Heart, and now pronounc'd it orderly, keeping even Pace with a Harp, touch'd upon that Occasion; no other musical Instrument being allow'd of for the said Purpose than this alone, as being Masculin, much sweeter, and fuller than any other.\\" Training The training took place in schools under an Ollamh and was long and arduous. Poems were created in the dark while lying down. Traditional payment was in gold rings, horses, land or apparel. =Types= Other notable styles practiced may have been the caoineadh or death lament and the fonn or mantra of repetition. Aer refers to poetical satire, a form used against the powerful. As satirists poets had the power to destroy the reputation of even the highest nobility. Some satires were reputed to bring disease and blemish to the accused, others humiliation. Technical Terms Irish contains many terms for types of rhyme and rhythms used in the delivery of d√°n direach. A poem consisted of quatrains called rann (division) the quatrain is divided into two parts called leathrann (half verse/couplet). A single line is called ceathramhain. Whatever sound, syllable or line a poem begins with, it must end on the same. This is called d√∫nadh (closing). Consonants were divided into hard, soft, light, rough, and strong groups. Strong consonants rhymed with light for example. Vowels were grouped into broad and slender. The broad vowels are a, o, u, √°, √≥, & √∫. The slender vowels are e, i, √© & √≠. Consonants were classed as broad or slender depending on what vowels preceded them. Comhardadh means literally correspondence or equality, and approximates to rhyme in English but has a wider meaning. Comhardadh sl√°n means 'perfect rhyme' and comhardadh briste means 'broken rhyme'. Comhardadh could be final, internal, or aicill. Aicill technique rhymes the final stressed word of one line with the next-to-last unstressed word in the next line. The final rhyming word is called rinn, 'tip' and the unstressed rhyming word airdrinn, 'attention-tip'. A word can also rhyme with two words instead of just one. The standard forms of rhyme were recognised. Amus meant vowel rhyming or assonance, in which the vowels are repeated, uaithne consonant rhyming or consonance, in which the consonants are the same, uaim alliteration, or the repetition of initial consonants. Comhardadh occurs only when the first syllable of each word had the same vowel and consonants of the same class and broadness/slenderness. The terminology extends to the number of syllables in a word. * dialt - a single syllable, or a monosyllabic word * recomhrac - 2 syllable word * iarcomhrac - 3 syllable word * felis - 4 syllable word * cloenre - 5 syllable word * luibenchossac - 6 syllable word * claidemnas - 7 syllable word * bricht - 8 syllable word Example An domhan √≥ mhuir go muir Ar son gur chuir fa chomhthaibh - Cr√©ad acht c√°s br√≥in do bhrosdadh? - Ar bh√°s n√≠or fh√≥ir Alasdar.

In his early career he won two of his three National Hunt Flat races and was a successful Novice Hurdler, winning the Dovecote Novices' Hurdle and Top Novices' Hurdle as well as finishing second in the Supreme Novices' Hurdle. In the 1991/1992 season, Granville Again won all five of his completed races including the Champion Hurdle Trial and the Scottish Champion Hurdle but fell when second favourite for the Champion Hurdle. In the following season he was beaten in his first three starts but returned to his best form to defeat a strong field in the Champion Hurdle. He never won again and failed to finish in the first three in his last ten races. He was retired from racing in 1996 and died in 2003 at the age of seventeen. Background Granville Again was a chestnut horse with a narrow white blaze, bred in Ireland by Marshall Parkhill. He was sired by Deep Run, an outstanding sire of jumpers whose other progeny included Dawn Run and Golden Cygnet. Granville Again's dam, High Board was not a Thoroughbred, being a descendant of the mare Arab Maid, whose pedigree on her mother's side was uncertain. Arab Maid's other descendants included the dual Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Easter Hero. Two years before Granville Again was foaled, High Board had produced his full brother Morley Street, who won the Champion Hurdle in 1991. During the early part of his racing career, the gelding was owned by Godfrey Deacon and trained in County Wexford by Henry Cleary. Racing career =1989/1990 National Hunt season: National Hunt Flat races= Granville Again began his racing career as a four-year-old in early 1990 by competing in National Hunt Flat races (also known as \\"bumpers\\"). He made his debut at Leopardstown Racecourse on 19 March when he started at odds of 4/1 and won by six lengths from eight opponents. He followed up at Navan Racecourse on 1 May, starting favourite and winning by eight lengths. Ten days later at Phoenix Park he ended his first season by finishing second to the Dermot Weld-trained favourite General Idea. =1990/1991 National Hunt season: Novice Hurdles= Before the start of the 1990/1991 National Hunt season, Granvile Again was sold to Eric Scarth and sent to be trained in England by Martin Pipe. He competed in Novice Hurdle races, making his debut over obstacles at Chepstow Racecourse on 22 December where he finished second to the five-year-old Upton Park. On 7 January at Wolverhampton Racecourse he recorded his first success over hurdles, winning by twelve lengths in a \\"canter\\" at odds of 1/3. He followed up three weeks later at Leicester, starting the 2/9 favourite and winning by eight lengths. The gelding was then moved up in class to contest the Grade II Dovecote Novices' Hurdle at Kempton Park on 23 February and started 11/4 second favourite behind Gaasid, a former flat racer who had won the Kennel Gate Novices' Hurdle at Ascot in November. Ridden by Peter Scudamore, Granville Again overtook Gaasid at the penultimate hurdle and drew away to win by fifteen lengths. In March 1991, Granville Again made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival and started the 2/1 favourite in a field of twenty-one for the Supreme Novices' Hurdle. He was hampered twice during the race, and although he finished strongly, he was unable to catch the Irish-trained Destriero and finished second, beaten four lengths by the winner and three quarters of a length ahead of Gran Alba. On 5 April, Granville Again started the 5/4 favourite for the Grade II Top Novices' Hurdle at the Grand National meeting at Aintree Racecourse. He was restrained by Scudamore in the early stages before moving into contention at half way. He took the lead jumping the final hurdle and won by one and a half lengths from Gran Alba with Young Pokey (later to win the Arkle Challenge Trophy) in third place. =1991/1992 National Hunt season= In the first half of the 1991/1992 season Granville Again contested three legs of the Sport of Kings Challenge, a series of races intended to promote international competition in jump racing. In November he traveled to Ireland and defeated the Paddy Mullins-trained mare Minorettes Girl by twelve lengths at odds of 4/5 before returning to England for the next two races of the series. At Cheltenham on 7 December he beat the Challow Novices' Hurdle winner Tyrone Bridge (also trained by Martin Pipe) by three quarters of a length with the Sun Alliance Novices' Hurdle winner Crystal Spirit twenty lengths back in third. At Chepstow two weeks later he won the final leg of the challenge by beating Tyrone Bridge again, this time by two lengths. In January, Granville Again was matched against more experienced opponents in the Champion Hurdle Trial at Haydock Park Racecourse. Starting the 1/2 favourite he was restrained by Scudamore in the early stages before overtaking the mare Winnie the Witch on the run-in and won by two lengths. On 10 March 1992, Granville Again started 9/2 second favourite behind his brother Morley Street in the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham. After being held up towards the rear of the field he made progress towards the lead before falling at the second last hurdle when looking the likely winner. A month after his fall at Cheltenham, Granville Again started 4/7 favourite for the Scottish Champion Hurdle at Ayr Racecourse. Taking the lead at the penultimate hurdle, he accelerated clear in the closing stages to win in \\"impressive\\" style from Jinxy Jack and Fidway. =1992/1993 National Hunt season= On 15 November 1992 at Cheltenham, Granville Again and Morley Street met for the second time in the Elite Hurdle in which the other two runners were Tyrone Bridge and the Triumph Hurdle winner Oh So Risky. Granville Again took the lead approaching the final hurdle but was overtaken by his brother on the run in and beaten a length. The Bula Hurdle at the same course attracted an exceptionally strong field for a Grade II race and Granville Again finished second to Halkopous, ahead of Morley Street, Oh So Risky and Kribensis. Granville Again started the 11/10 favourite for the Grade I Christmas Hurdle at Kempton on 26 December. He appeared to have every chance at the second last hurdle, but failed to quicken in the closing stages and finished third to Mighty Mogul and Flown. The other runners included Oh So Risky, Kribensis and Gran Alba in fifth, sixth and seventh places. Following the advice of Michael W. Dickinson, Martin Pipe decided to give the gelding a long break before the Cheltenham Festival. On 16 March 1993, Granville Again started the 13/2 second favourite for the 64th running of the Champion Hurdle. His opponents included Flown (the 7/2 favourite), Halkopous, Oh So Risky, Morley Street, Jinxy Jack, Vintage Crop, Flakey Dove, Duke of Monmouth (Triumph Hurdle) and Coulton (Mersey Novices' Hurdle). Scudamore settled Granville Again in the middle of the field before beginning to make progress at the third last. He took the lead approaching the final hurdle and was driven out in the closing stages to win by a length from the 50/1 outsider Royal Derbi with Halkopous two and a half lengths away in third. After the race, Pipe said \\"This horse has plenty of ability but was just a bit off colour earlier in the season. But he battled well today and proved everybody wrong\\". Scudamore, who had considered switching to ride the stable's other runner Valfinet until Granville Again \\"sparkled\\" in a training gallop said \\"He was going so well that I wondered if anything was there, then I tapped him to make sure and he was immediately on the bridle. Everything kept opening up for me as I was coming down the hill, the way it always seems to when you're going well\\". At Aintree in April Granville Again was moved up in distance for the Grade Aintree Hurdle over two and a half miles. He started the 10/11 favourite but was beaten one and a half lengths by Morley Street, with Flown two lengths away in third. =Later career= Granville Again remained in training for another four seasons, but never recovered his best form. In the 1993/1994 season he finished fourth in the Ascot Hurdle before falling in the Bula Hurdle. He finished fourth in the Irish Champion Hurdle and seventh behind Flakey Dove in the 1994 Champion Hurdle before running fifth in the Scottish Champion Hurdle for which he was trained by Len Lungo. In the following season he was trained by Muriel Naughton in Yorkshire and made only two appearances, finishing seventh in the Ascot Hurdle and twelfth behind Alderbrook in the 1995 Champion Hurdle. In early 1996 he was tried over fences and was pulled up in a novice steeplechase at Kempton and was then pulled up again in a handicap hurdle at Aintree. He made his final appearance in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle Racecourse on 30 November 1996 when he started a 100/1 outsider and was pulled up four hurdles from the finish. A veterinary inspection found that he was suffering from an irregular heartbeat. =Retirement= Granville Again was retired from racing after his run at Newcastle in 1996 and spent the remainder of his life at Eric Scarth's property in Northumberland. He died in 2003 at the age of seventeen. Martin Pipe said \\"Granville was an absolute star... he will be sorely missed and we shall all remember our friend with great affection\\".

The theory applies to any social group that may feel threatened in some way, whether or not that social group is a majority or minority group in their society. This theory deals with perceived threat rather than actual threat. Perceived threat includes all of the threats that members of group believe they are experiencing, regardless of whether those threats actually exist. For example, people may feel their economic well-being is threatened by an outgroup stealing their jobs even if, in reality, the outgroup has no effect on their job opportunities. Still, their perception that their job security is under threat can increase their levels of prejudice against the outgroup. Thus, even false alarms about threat still have ‚Äúreal consequence‚Äù for prejudice between groups. Original components of the theory Integrated Threat Theory was first proposed by Walter G. Stephan and Cookie White Stephan (2000).Stephan, W. G.; Stephan, C. W. (2000). An integrated threat theory of prejudice. In Oskamp, S. (Ed.) Reducing Prejudice and Discrimination (pp. 23‚Äì45). Mahwah, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. The original theory had four components: realistic threats, symbolic threats, intergroup anxiety, and negative stereotypes. =Realistic threats= Realistic threats are threats that pose a danger to the in-group's well-being. These can include threats to physical safety or health, threats to economic and political power, and threats to the existence of the group. This component was originally developed as a part of realistic conflict theory by Donald T. Campbell (1965).Campbell, D.T. (1965). Ethnocentric and Other Altruistic Motives. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. pp. 283‚Äì311. =Symbolic threats= Symbolic threats arise where there is a perceived difference between the values and worldview of an ingroup and outgroup. The difference can make the ingroup feel that the outgroup poses a threat to their group morals, standards, beliefs, and attitudes. These threats are thus strongly tied to a group's sense of identity. The category was derived from Gordon Allport‚Äôs discussion of the relationship between one's values and one's identity. He proposed that, since values are important to who we are, we will reject other groups that disagree with our values.Allport, G.W. (1954) The nature of prejudice. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley. It is also based on the research of Esses and colleagues (1993), who found that groups had more negative feelings towards an outgroup if that outgroup interfered with the in-group's customs.Esses V., Haddock G., and Zanna M. (1993) Values, stereotypes, and emotions as determinants of intergroup attitudes. In Mackie, D.M. & Hamilton, D.L. (Eds.), Affect, cognition, and stereotyping - interactive processes in group perception (pp. 137-166) San Diego, CA: Academic Press. =Intergroup anxiety= Intergroup anxiety refers to the expectation that interacting with someone from a different group will be a negative experience. People with intergroup anxiety fear that they will feel uncomfortable, embarrassed, unsafe, or judged, either by members of the outgroup or by people of their own in-group. Before creating the Integrated Threat Theory framework, Stephan & Stephan had been conducting research on intergroup anxiety.Stephan, W.G. & Stephan, C.W. (1985) Intergroup Anxiety. Journal of Social Issues, 41, 157-175. The concept of intergroup anxiety also draws from Aversive Racism Theory, which argues that subconscious negative feelings about Black Americans are an important part of racism against them.Gaertner, S.L. & Dovidio, J. F. (1986). \\"The aversive form of racism\\". In Gaertner, S.L. & Dovidio, J. F. (Eds.), Prejudice, Discrimination and Racism (pp. 61‚Äì89). Orlando: Academic Press. =Negative stereotypes= Stereotypes are a strategy of simplifying a complex situation by relying on popular pre- set judgements.Stephan, W.G. & Stephan, C.W. (1993) Cognition and affect in stereotyping : parallel interactive networks. In Mackie, D.M. & Hamilton, D.L. (Eds.), Affect, cognition, and stereotyping - interactive processes in group perception (pp. 137-166). San Diego, CA: Academic Press. Integrated Threat Theory predicts that negative pre-set judgments about another group can lead to prejudice. This component of ITT draws from research that found that belief in negatively-rated stereotypical traits was linked to higher levels of prejudice against the stereotyped group. Stephan & Stephan (2000) acknowledged that some research has not found links between prejudice and general stereotypes. Thus, it seems that, while general stereotypes assume some positive things about other groups, only the negative aspects of stereotypes are relevant to prejudice.  Updated two-component theory  In 2002, Stephan and Renfro proposed an updated version of the theory which reduced the four components to two basic types: realistic and symbolic threats.Stephan, W. G., & Renfro, C. L. (2002). The role of threat in intergroup relations. In D. M. Mackie & E. R. Smith (Eds.), From prejudice to inter-group emotions: Differentiated reactions to social groups (pp. 191‚Äì207). New York, NY: Psychology Press. The categories of negative stereotypes and intergroup anxiety were removed from the basic framework of the theory because they were found to be better understood as subtypes of threat. They can lead to either realistic or symbolic threats rather than standing as their own separate categories. For example, intergroup anxiety can be based on expectations of physical danger, a realistic threat, as well as on expectations of damage to one's identity, a symbolic threat. =Experimental Support= Since ITT makes a causal claim that perceived threat causes prejudice, studies using an experimental design are necessary. Some researchers have taken on this task to experimentally manipulate types of realistic and perceived threat in order to examine if they cause prejudice. For example, Esses and colleagues (1998) and Esses and colleagues (2001) carried out research studies in which they manipulated the research participants‚Äô understanding of economic threat posed by immigrants. Esses and colleagues (1998) had Canadian undergraduate student participants read one of two editorials that were written for the study. One editorial discussed a new group of immigrants with no mention of the job market while the other editorial discussed the same group and emphasized their success in finding jobs despite the scarcity of jobs in Canada. They then studied the effects of perception of economic threat, a type of realistic threat, on attitudes about immigrants and reported willingness to help immigrants. Results showed that participants that read the editorial that emphasized competition had less favorable attitudes towards immigrants and were less likely to approve of programs to empower immigrants Esses, V.M., Jackson, L.M., Armstrong, T.L. (1998). Intergroup competition and attitudes toward immigrants and immigration: An instrumental model. Journal of Social Issues, 54, 699-724. Esses and colleagues (2001) carried out similar experiments with very similar editorials. Their results showed that participants that read articles that emphasized the tough job market had more negative attitudes towards the immigrants, were less supportive of their immigration into Canada, and were less supportive of programs to empower immigrants. Esses, V.M., Dovidio, J.F., Jackson, L.M., Armstrong, T.L. (2001). The immigration dilemma: The role of perceived competition, ethnic prejudice, and national identity. Journal of Social Issues, 57, 389-412. The data from these research studies provide some support for the causal influence of realistic threat on prejudice against immigrants. The causal influence of symbolic threat on prejudice was partially explored in a study by Branscombe & Wann (1994), who focused on perceived threat to in-group identity in particular. The participants, undergraduate females from the U.S., answered questionnaires about their levels of pride in their American identity at the beginning of the study. They then manipulated the participants‚Äô perceived threat to in-group identity using video clips, which either showed an American or a Russian boxer beating the other in a match. After seeing one version of the video, participants completed a questionnaire that measured their desire to distance themselves from the outgroup, in this case, Russians. The results of this study showed that increased perception of threat to in-group identity raises a desire to distance oneself from the out-group. Branscome, N. & Wann, D. (1994). Collective self esteem consequences of outgroup derogation when a valued social identity is on trial. European Journal of Social Psychology, 24, 641-657 This provides some experimental evidence that perception of threat to in-group identity may causes greater prejudice towards out-groups. However, further experimental research is necessary in order to more firmly and widely establish the causal role of realistic and symbolic threats in prejudice.  Factors that influence levels of perceived threat  Several factors can lead to increased or decreased levels of group perceived threat.[such as?] =Power Dynamics= The updated ITT theory draws from the findings of contact hypothesis, which claims that it is important to have equality between groups. Power dynamics between two groups are shown to have an influence on how the groups relate to and perceive each other. High-power groups are more likely to influence and threaten other groups. Low-power groups are often vulnerable to the influence and threats of other groups. Thus, low-power groups tend to be on alert and perceive more threats than high power groups do. Stephan, Walter G.; Ybarra, Oscar; Morrison, Kimberly Rios (2009). \\"Intergroup Threat Theory\\". In Nelson, Todd D. Handbook of Prejudice, Stereotyping, and Discrimination. Psychology Press. Taylor and Francis Group. p. 44. Corenblum & Stephan (2001) found, for example, that Native Canadians felt more threatened by White Canadians than White Canadians felt about them. Corenblum, B. & Stephan, WG. (2001). White fears and native apprehensions: An integrated threat theory approach to intergroup attitudes. Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science- Revue Canadienne des Sciences du Comportement, 33, 251-268. However, when high-power groups do perceive threat from another group, they ‚Äúwill react more strongly‚Äù than low-power groups.Stephan, Walter G.; Ybarra, Oscar; Morrison, Kimberly Rios (2009). \\"Intergroup Threat Theory\\". In Nelson, Todd D. Handbook of Prejudice, Stereotyping, and Discrimination. Psychology Press. Taylor and Francis Group. p. 44. This is likely because they have more to lose if the threat is real and have more resources that allow them to counter to such threats.Stephan, Walter G.; Ybarra, Oscar; Morrison, Kimberly Rios (2009). \\"Intergroup Threat Theory\\". In Nelson, Todd D. Handbook of Prejudice, Stereotyping, and Discrimination. Psychology Press. Taylor and Francis Group. p. 44. Two groups of relatively equal power status can be especially sensitive to feeling threatened if they are in competition with each other for resources, such as jobs. Garcia, S.M., Torr, A., Gonzales, R. (2006) Ranks and rivals: A theory of competition. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 32, 970-982. =Identity= Stephan & Renfro (2016) predicted that, the more important group membership is to ingroup members‚Äô sense of personal identity, the more likely those people will feel threatened by and uncomfortable when interacting with other groups. According to this prediction, people with strong in-group identification are likely to be more focused on differences between the groups, thus giving them more motivation to hold negative stereotypes of other groups so that they can believe that their group is the best. Stephan, W.G., & Renfro, C.L. (2016). The Role of Threat in Intergroup Relations. In Mackie, D.M. & Smith, E.R. (Eds.), From Prejudice to Intergroup Emotions: Differentiated Reactions to Social Groups, (191-207). ProQuest Ebook Central. =Culture= There may be a link between the personal importance of group membership and the larger culture in which the groups live. Collectivistic cultures, for example, place a greater emphasis on the importance of group membership compared to individualistic cultures.Markus, H.R. & Kitayama, S. (1991). Culture and the Self: Implications for Cognition, Emotion, and Motivation. Psychological Review, 98, 224-253. Culture can also influence perceived threat between groups through the culture's level of uncertainty avoidance. Hofstede & Bond (1984) define uncertainty avoidance as ‚Äúthe degree to which people feel threatened by ambiguous situations, and have created beliefs and institutions that try to avoid these.‚ÄùHofstede, G. & Bond, M. H., (1984). Hofstede‚Äôs Culture Dimensions: An Independent Validation Using Rokeach‚Äôs Value Survey. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 15, 417-433. Stephan & Renfro (2002) thus suggest that cultures which hold norms and laws as very important are likely to perceive threat from ‚Äúunfamiliar groups.‚Äù Further research on these topics can better inform the role of culture in intergroup relationships. Research applications The Integrated Threat Theory has been used in research on various social groups, including immigrants, Muslims, tourists, and more. =Immigrants= Multiple studies on inter-group relations have focused on immigrants. For example, Ward and Masgoret (2006) built upon ITT in combination with the Instrumentive Model of Group Conflict to test a model of attitudes toward immigrants, using participants from New Zealand. These participants filled out questionnaires that measured Multicultural Ideology, Intergroup Anxiety, Contact with Immigrants, Perceived Intergroup Threat, and Attitudes toward Immigrants. The results supported the model, suggesting that increased contact with immigrants and multicultural ideology are related to lower levels of perceived threat from immigrants, which is in turn directly related to more positive attitudes towards immigrants. Ward, C. & Masgoret, A.M. (2006). An integrative model of attitudes towards immigrants. International Journal of Intercultural Relations, 30, 671-682. Croucher (2013) used the ITT framework to explore reasons that dominant groups in France, Germany, and Great Britain sometimes resist Muslim immigrants‚Äô efforts to assimilate. The data was collected through questionnaires, which included measures for symbolic threats, realistic threats, stereotypes, perception of immigrants‚Äô motivation to assimilate, and multigroup ethnic identity. The results supported the theory that the more that the dominant groups felt threatened by the immigrants, the less they thought that the immigrants wanted to assimilate into their country. Croucher, S.M. (2013). Integrated threat theory and acceptance of immigrant assimilation: an analysis of Muslim immigration in Western Europe. Communication Monographs, 80, 46-62. Similarly, Rohmann, Piontkowski, and van Randenborgh (2008) used the ITT framework to examine the relationship between perceived threat and a dominant group's expectation of an immigrant group's attitude about acculturation. Their research included two studies, one in which German participants were asked about their expectations of French and Turkish immigrants in Germany and another in which German participants were asked about their expectations of two fictitious groups, based on paragraph- long descriptions. Results from both studies suggest that levels of perceived threat are higher if dominant groups expect that an immigrant group has different attitudes about acculturation than the dominant group does.Rohmann, A., Piontkowski, U., & van Randenborgh, A. (2008). When attitudes do not fit: discordance of acculturation attitudes as an antecedent of intergroup threat. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 34, 337-352. =Muslims= Tausch, Hewstone, and Roy (2009) examined Muslim relations with Hindus in India. ITT was incorporated into their research in order to examine which factors are important in perceived threat between the minority Muslim and majority Hindu groups of India. Their data was collected through a survey given to both Muslim and Hindu students at the same university, which measured contact quantity, contact quality, perceived relative status of the two groups, realistic threats, symbolic threats, intergroup anxiety, preference for social distance, and in-group bias. Tausch, N., Hewstone, M., & Roy, R. (2009). The relationships between contact, status and prejudice: An integrated threat theory analysis of Hindu‚ÄìMuslim relations in India. Journal of Community & Applied Social Psychology, 19, 83-94.Results showed that symbolic threat was important for Hindus‚Äô levels of perceived threat while realistic threat was important for Muslims‚Äô levels of perceived threat. Gonzalez and colleagues (2008) carried out similar research in the Netherlands, examining the prejudice of Dutch youth, who are members of the majority, against the Muslim minority in the country. Their data was collected through a questionnaire given to high schoolers in different cities, which measured support for multicultural ideologies, frequency of contact with Muslims, in‚Äêgroup identification, realistic economic threat, symbolic threats, stereotypes, and prejudicial attitudes towards Muslims.Gonzalez, K.V., Verkuyten, M.W., Jeroen Poppe, E. (2008). Prejudice towards Muslims in The Netherlands: Testing integrated threat theory. British Journal of Social Psychology, 47, 667-685. Results showed that prejudicial attitudes were related to higher perception of symbolic threats and more belief in stereotypes. Uenal (2016) applied the ITT framework to better understand factors involved in the presence of Islamophobic conspiracy stereotypes in Europe. The data was collected through an online survey given to German university students which measured ambiguity intolerance, belief in a clash of civilizations, realistic threats, symbolic threats, and levels of education. Uenal, F. (2016). The \\"Secret Islamization\\" of Europe: Exploring Integrated Threat Theory for Predicting Islamophobic Conspiracy Stereotypes. International Journal Of Conflict And Violence, 10, 94-108. Ambiguity intolerance was found to be related to increased conspiracy stereotypes through increased perceptions of symbolic threat. Belief in a clash of civilizations was found to be related to higher levels of realistic and symbolic threat and higher levels of belief in conspiracy stereotypes. Higher education levels showed the opposite trends, as it was related to lower levels of perceived threat and lower levels of belief in conspiracy stereotypes. =Tourists= Tourism can bring different groups into contact and has thus been the subject of some research on inter-group relations using ITT. For example, Ward and Berno (2011) used ITT and contact hypothesis as theoretical backgrounds for predicting attitudes about tourism in Fiji and New Zealand. They collected data through surveys, which included measures of perceived impact of tourism, contact with tourists, the four aspects of the original ITT, and attitudes towards tourists. Ward, C. & Berno, T. (2011). Beyond social exchange theory: Attitudes towards tourists. Annals of Tourism Research, 38, 1556-1569. Following the expectations of ITT, the data showed that lower levels of perceived realistic threat, symbolic threat, and intergroup anxiety, and more positive stereotypes were useful predictors of positives attitudes about tourism. Monterubio (2016) applied ITT in studying negative attitudes towards spring break tourists in Cancun, Mexico. Data was collected through interviews with Cancun residents, which included questions about the social impact of spring break and attitudes towards spring breakers.Monterrubio, C. (2016). The impact of spring break behaviour: An integrated threat theory analysis of residents' prejudice. Tourism Management, 54, 418-427. Transcripts of these interviews were then analyzed for themes, including the four components of the original ITT. The results suggested that realistic threats and intergroup anxiety were relevant aspects of prejudice against spring break tourists, largely because of the influence of their behavior. Critique of the theory Stephan & Renfro (2002) updated ITT into the two-factor model and admitted that ‚Äúultimately, the model is circular.‚Äù The theory states that perceived threat leads to prejudice but the outcomes of that prejudice itself can also lead into increased perceived threat. Anxiety/Uncertainty Management Theory counters the way that ITT conceptualizes anxiety as harmful for relationships between social groups. Instead, it understands anxiety as helpful for leading to more effective communication between groups. Gudykunst, W. D. (1995). Anxiety/uncertainty management (AUM) theory: Current status. International and intercultural communication annual, 19, 8-58.

MOOSE makes use of the PETSc non-linear solver package and libmesh to provide the finite element discretization. A key design aspect of MOOSE is the decomposition of weak form residual equations into separate terms that are each represented by compute kernels. The combination of these kernels into complete residuals describing the problem to be solved is performed at run time. This allows modifications such as toggling of mechanisms and the addition of new physics without recompilation. MOOSE comes with an extensive library of kernels providing residual terms for solid mechanics, Navier‚ÄìStokes equations, phase field models and more. MOOSE uses VTK. Background The development of MOOSE at Idaho National Laboratory (INL), beginning in May 2008, has resulted in a unique approach to computational engineering that combines computer science with a strong underlying mathematical description in a unique way that allows scientists and engineers to develop engineering simulation tools in a fraction of the time previously required. The heart of MOOSE is the Kernel. A Kernel is a \\"piece\\" of physics. To add new physics to an application built using MOOSE, all that is required is to supply a new Kernel that describes the discrete form of the equation. It's usually convenient to think of a Kernel as a mathematical operator, such as a Laplacian or a convection term in a partial differential equation (PDE). Kernels may be swapped or coupled together to achieve different application goals. These Kernels, which now number in the hundreds, allow a scientist or engineer to develop an application rapidly. For a new application, existing Kernels are selected as-is, or modified as necessary, and \\"plugged\\" in. An advection-diffusion-reaction equation is of the same mathematical form no matter what application it is being used for. Typically, only the form of the coefficients or the dependencies on other physics need to be defined; rarely must complete Kernels be constructed from scratch. With MOOSE, only the Kernel development is required from the scientist or engineer (application developer). MOOSE is designed to do everything else for the application developer, such as finite element discretization of the PDEs, the nonlinear solver, and the parallel high performance computing. The idea of naming MOOSE-based applications after Idaho indigenous animal species is loosely based on Los Alamos National Laboratory's 1970s ‚Äì 1990s approach to naming their codes after Native American tribes and artifacts, such as APACHE, CONCHAS, and the KIVA series of codes. There are now over twenty MOOSE-based application animals in various stages of development, ranging from recently obtaining preliminary results to being nationally recognized as state-of-the-art efforts (such as BISON, PEREGRINE, and MARMOT for fuels performance modeling & simulation activities). Description fuel pellet has chipped away (center left) due to a manufacturing defect or damage incurred while it was in transit. The damaged pellet surface induces a high-stress state in the adjacent cladding. As a result, the pellets warm up and densify before swelling back out due to fission products building up inside of them, further stressing the surrounding fuel cladding. MOOSE is a development and run-time environment for the solution of multi-physics systems that involve multiple physical models or multiple simultaneous physical phenomena. The systems are generally represented (modeled) as a system of fully coupled nonlinear partial differential equation systems (an example of a multi-physics system is the thermal feedback effect upon neutronics cross-sections where the cross- sections are a function of the heat transfer). Inside MOOSE, the Jacobian-Free Newton Krylov (JFNK) method is implemented as a parallel nonlinear solver that naturally supports effective coupling between physics equation systems (or Kernels). The physics Kernels are designed to contribute to the nonlinear residual, which is then minimized inside of MOOSE. MOOSE provides a comprehensive set of finite element support capabilities (libMesh) and provides for mesh adaptation and parallel execution. The framework heavily leverages software libraries from the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), such as the nonlinear solver capabilities in either the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) project or the Trilinos project. =ELK (Extended Library of Kernels)= ELK is a library for common Kernels, boundary conditions and material base classes. =YAK (Yet Another Kernel)= YAK is a library of common actions, Kernels, boundary conditions, and material base classes for radiation transport applications. YAK is currently linked with RattleSnake (multi-group radiation Sn transport), Pronghorn (multi-group diffusion), and Critter (multi-length scale temperature feedback). Applications =BISON= BISON was the first MOOSE-based application \\"animal,\\" and is a finite element-based nuclear fuel performance code applicable to a variety of fuel forms including light water reactor fuel rods, TRISO fuel particles, and metallic rod and plate fuel. It solves the fully coupled equations of thermomechanics and species diffusion and includes important fuel physics such as fission gas release and material property degradation with burnup. BISON is based on the MOOSE framework and can therefore efficiently solve problems on either two-dimensional axisymmetric or three-dimensional geometries using standard workstations or large high performance computers. Plasticity, irradiation growth, and thermal and irradiation creep models are implemented for clad materials. Models are also available to simulate gap heat transfer, mechanical contact, and the evolution of the gap/plenum pressure with plenum volume, gas temperature, and fission gas addition. BISON is also coupled to a MOOSE-based mesoscale phase field material property simulation capability. =MARMOT= MARMOT is a finite element-based phase field code for modeling irradiation-induced microstructure evolution. MARMOT predicts the effect of radiation damage on microstructure evolution, including void nucleation and growth, bubble growth, grain boundary migration, and gas diffusion and segregation. The phase field equations can be coupled with heat conduction and solid mechanics from ELK to consider the effect of temperature and stress gradients on the evolution. In addition, MARMOT calculates the effect of the microstructure evolution on various bulk material properties, including thermal conductivity and porosity. Once the bulk properties have been calculated, they can be passed to BISON for a fuel performance simulation. This coupling between MARMOT and BISON has been achieved in the hybrid code BARMOT.K Chockalingam, MR Tonks, JD Hales, DR Gaston, PC Millett, L Zhang. 2012.

Parallel algorithms and software for nuclear, energy, and environmental applications Part I: Multiphysics Algorithms, Communications in Computational Physics Reliable reservoir performance predictions of EGS systems require accurate and robust modeling for the coupled thermal-hydrological-mechanical processes.

FALCON eliminates the need for using operator splitting methods to simulate these systems, and the scalability of MOOSE supported applications allows for simulating these tightly coupled processes at the reservoir scale, allowing for examination of the system as a whole (something the operator splitting methodologies generally cannot do).Podgorney, R.K, H.

These problems are common in various subsurface-engineered systems, such as engineered environmental remediation, enhanced geothermal systems and carbon dioxide geological sequestration. Currently, the physics that could be coupled in RAT include: single-phase fluid flow in porous media, advection, dispersion and diffusion transport, aqueous kinetic reaction, aqueous equilibrium reaction, kinetic mineral precipitation/dissolution reaction, and Carmen-Kozeny porosity-permeability relationship. This software is not to be confused with the Reactor Analysis Tool (RAT) which is a toolkit based on ROOT and GEANT4 for microphysical simulations of scintillation detectors used in neutrino and dark matter experiments including Braidwood, SNO+, and DEAP-3600. =RELAP-7= RELAP-7 is the next-generation tool in the RELAP safety/systems analysis application series and is based upon the MOOSE development and runtime environment framework. RELAP-7 will retain and improve the basic analysis capability of RELAP5. The four major improvements are 1) A well-posed seven-equation two-phase flow model (liquid, gas, and interface pressures) versus the obsolete ill-posed six-equation flow model (non-physical mixture sound speed) found in RELAP5; 2) Improved numerical approximations resulting in second-order accuracy in both space and time versus the first order approximations in RELAP5; 3) Implicit tightly coupled time integration for long duration transients, such as providing plant behavior for full life fuel cycle evaluations; and 4) the ability to easily couple to multi- dimensional core simulators being developed in other programs (NEAMS, CASL, ATR LEP). =Pronghorn= Pronghorn was originally developed for simulation of the gas-cooled pebble-bed VHTR concept. The current capabilities of Pronghorn include transient and steady coupled porous fluid flow and solid-state heat conduction with a standard multi-group diffusion model (i.e., fixed-source, criticality, and time-dependent). Recently added capabilities include a nonlinear acceleration scheme for criticality problems and a simple thermal- fluid model for the prismatic reactor concept. Future capabilities will include a more advanced multi-phase flow type of model (to study thermal boundary layer effects) and a radiation transport model. The physics can be solved in three-dimensional Cartesian (x, y, z) or cylindrical (r, q, z) space, with precursor and adiabatic thermal feedback models. This code has been validated against the PBMR400 benchmark problem. Using Pronghorn, rod ejection simulations have been conducted for thermal-fluids/neutronics for both pebble-bed and prismatic gas-cooled reactors and simple thermal- neutronics coupled LWR benchmark problems.H.

Vojtƒõch Adalbert Hynais (also Albert; 14 January 1854, Vienna ‚Äì 22 August 1925, Prague) was a Czech painter, designer and graphics artist. He designed the curtain of the Prague National Theatre, decorated a number of buildings in Prague and Vienna, and was a founding member of the Vienna Secession. He was made an Officer of the L√©gion d'honneur in 1924.  Life  Hynais's father was a Czech tailor who had moved to Vienna, and did not want his children to receive a German education, so Hynais was taught at home. He began studying at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna in 1870, under Carl Wurzinger and August Eisenmenger, then at Anselm Feuerbach's school in spring 1873; he was considered to be one of his most promising students. He visited Italy and saw Rome in 1874 with Janez ≈†ubic and again 1877 with Feuerbach. Hynais lived in Paris from 1878 to 1893, where he learnt from Paul-Jacques-Aim√© Baudry and Jean-L√©on G√©rome, and knew Alfons Mucha. In 1885, he received an honorable mention from the 1885 Universal Exhibition of Fine Arts, and a first-class medal at the 1889 World's Fair. He married his wife, Augusta Voirinov√°, in Paris, with whom he had two children. The curtain of the Prague National Theatre, painted by Hynais in 1883. During the 1870s, art was being produced to decorate the under-construction Prague National Theatre. Hynais was not considered to be suitably representative of the national spirit by Czech art critics because he lived in, and had absorbed too much influence from, Vienna. Still, he created nationalist images for the Royal Lounge, including allegorical, historico-mythic scenes and landscapes of Bohemia. On 12 August 1881, one month before the National Theatre's scheduled opening, a fire completely destroyed the building. Hynais designed the new curtain; again, he used historical allegory to create a nationalist impression, and also to tell the story of the National Theatre. Slavia, the national embodiment, is shown receiving gifts from the nation; workers rebuild the theatre, while artists decorate it; national flags and symbols are shown all around. Hynais had made the first sketches for the curtain while living in Montmartre; the winged figure is modelled on Suzanne Valadon. Hynais's work for the National Theatre is what he is mostly remembered for; he was part of the \\"Generation of the National Theatre\\" together with Mikol√°≈° Ale≈°, V√°clav Bro≈æ√≠k, Julius Ma≈ô√°k and Franti≈°ek ≈Ωen√≠≈°ek, among others. The work's style was likened to his teacher Feurbach's. Winter (c. 1890). Hynais created the first poster for the General Land Centennial Exhibition of 1891, using distinctively Czech symbols prominently in the design; the poster would earn him recognition. Tom√°≈° Masaryk, the President of Czechoslovakia, sat for him ninety-four times. In 1894, his work won a medal, first class, at the Antwerp World's Fair. Hynais worked for the S√®vres porcelain firm between 1889 and 1892 as a graphics artist, and became a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague in 1894. While living in Prague, Hynais was a founding member of the Vienna Secession. Emil Orlik and Maximilian Pirner were other important Secessionists in the city. In 1900, together with two of his students, Hynais painted the ceiling of the Pantheon in the Royal State Museum, Prague; Hynais's parts in particular were described as being \\"the best of what was created in the whole vast building and perhaps in all of Prague\\". In 1923, he was made an Officer of the L√©gion d'honneur, and in 1924 was granted an honorary professorship at the Prague Academy.  Work  Venus as a harbinger of both vitality and danger. During his Italian period, he painted mainly religious and mythological images, including for the Czech Hospice in Rome. From Paris, he brought the Czech Art Nouveau artists into contact with foreign influences; he, himself, was a Symbolist influence, and also a point of contact with proto-Impressionism. Hynais was part of a broader axis of connection between Paris and Prague at the turn of the century: other Czech artists living in the city in the period included Alfons Mucha, Franti≈°ek Kupka and Ludƒõk Marold, among others. Hynais was interested in integrating the human and the natural, and particularly female nudes. He was described as \\"a delicate poet depicting the beauty of the female body.\\" Hynais also bound together religious and aesthetic considerations. He did, however, maintain some distance between his decorative-poetic work and his political-nationalist work.

In order to freely practice their Christian faith in accordance with the Lutheran confessions outlined in the Book of Concord, approximately 700 Saxon Lutherans left for the United States in November 1838. Their ships arrived January 5, 1839 in New Orleans. After spending some time waiting for that last ship (which was lost at sea), most of the remaining 600 immigrants settled in Perry County, Missouri, and in and around St. Louis. Among the group were Christian Adolph Bergt and Caroline Louise Voelker, who married in 1841. In 1847 the Bergts acquired the property of an early pioneer named Thomas Twyman who had settled in the area in 1820. The property remained in the Bergt family until 1957. The property was purchased by the Concordia Historical Institute of St. Louis in 1961. The property was restored and in 1964 was dedicated and opened to the public as a \\"walk-in History Book\\" of German immigrant life in America.

The latter had declared war on Syracuse because their common enemy, the Sicel leader Ducetius, had returned to Sicily to colonize Cale Acte. Syracuse had exiled rather than executed Ducetius in 450 BC. Syracuse defeated Acragas and the conflict was settled with a peace treaty. In classical antiquity the name Himera was used for two rivers on Sicily: the Grande and the Salso. The Grande flows north towards its mouth at the site of ancient Himera, the Salso follows a southern course to its mouth in modern Licata. It is not certain near which river the battle took place.  Background  In 450 BC Ducetius was decisively defeated by Syracuse in the Battle of Nomae and by Acragas at Motyum. Fearing that he would be slain by his own people, he fled to Syracuse in a desperate attempt to save himself. At night he entered the city's marketplace and seated himself at the altars of the gods to become a suppliant who was entitled to sanctuary. The Syracusans were amazed and magistrates called a meeting of the Assembly to determine how he should be dealt with. Some proposed to punish him, but the elder citizens convinced the Assembly that it would be a sacrilege to execute a suppliant. The Syracusans exiled Ducetius to Corinth and provided him with sufficient financial resources to support himself. After spending some time in Corinth Ducetius broke the agreement and sailed back to Sicily with colonists to found Cale Acte. This angered the Acragantines, who were envious of Syracusans and accused them of releasing their common enemy without having consulted them first. They declared war on Syracuse.  Battle and aftermath  The other Greek cities of Sicily were divided, some joined Acragas and some joined Syracuse. The two forces met near the Himera River where Syracuse won the battle. Over a thousand Acragantines were killed in the fighting. After the battle Acragas sent ambassadors to Syracuse to discuss terms for a peace treaty which ended the war. The terms of the treaty are unknown. The battle may have taken place on the southern Himera River, the modern Salso. Syracuse probably had a superiority in cavalry, which made Acragas pick a battle site close to a river to negate this advantage of their enemy somewhat. Nevertheless, its superior cavalry most likely enabled Syracuse to win the battle. The amount of Syracusan casualties would have been minor.

The censuses were primarily concerned with administration and faced numerous problems in their design and conduct ranging from absence of house numbering in hamlets to cultural objections on various grounds to dangers posed by wild animals to census personnel. The censuses were designed more for social engineering and to further the British agenda for governance rather than to uncover the underlying structure of the population. The sociologist Michael Mann says that the census exercise was \\"more telling of the administrative needs of the British than of the social reality for the people of British India.\\" The difference of the nature of Indian society during the British Raj from the value system and the societies of the West were highlighted by the inclusion of \\"caste\\", \\"religion\\", \\"profession\\" and \\"age\\" in the data to be collected, as the collection and analysis of this information had a considerable impact on the structure and political overtones of Indian society.  Administrative background  There were historical attempts to enumerate the population in parts of the Indian subcontinent as well as to assess landholdings for revenue purposes, which was then a primary consideration. They are attested in the writings of Kautilya, Abul Fazl and Muhnot Nainsi. The East India Company, too, carried out quantitative exercises in various places and at various times prior to the Indian Rebellion of 1857, after which its authority to govern the country ‚Äî often referred to as Company Rule ‚Äî was replaced by the administrators operating under the auspices of the British Crown. The 1865 census of the North-West Provinces is sometimes referred to as the first proper census in India. By 1872, the only administrative area of British India where there had not been an attempt to conduct a region-wide enumeration was Bengal Province. The various limited exercises conducted prior to 1869 have been described as \\"fragmentary, hardly systematic and lack[ing in] any uniformity\\". In 1872, the British Raj authorities concluded the first \\"all-India census.\\" However, S. C. Srivastava says that it did not in fact cover all of the country and that it was asynchronous, being conducted between 1867 and 1872 after an initial 1856 decision to introduce decennial enumerations from 1861 was disrupted by the 1857 Rebellion. The first synchronous decennial census was conducted in 1881 and has continued thus since, although the 1941 exercise was severely curtailed and very little of its data was published due to World War II. The 1931 census is often considered be the last British-administered census. The report of the 1881 census comprised three volumes; that of 1931 comprised 28. British India ceased to exist in 1947, when partition occurred. Throughout the British Raj, and onwards until 1961 in the Republic of India, responsibility for census operations lay with temporary administrative structures that were established for each census and then dismantled. Those tasked with gathering the data faced various unusual situations. Matters of culture affected even simple processes such as house numbering, with Bhil people objecting on the grounds of superstition and Burmese people on the grounds of artistry. Enumerators also faced dangerous situations, including instances of being attacked by tigers. According to the 1891 Census Commissioner, the respondents were almost all illiterate and often \\"unwilling and obtuse\\". Objections based on various rumours that the censuses were intended to introduce new taxes, aid military or labour recruitment, assist in conversions to Christianity and force migration were not uncommon, at least in the early decades. There were also incidents of violence, although they tended to occur in places where tensions between native people and the British were already high.  Role of the census  Ram Bhagat points out that a demographic census is an exercise in the classification of a population and it is inherently constrained. An example of this is that the questions asked require non-overlapping responses, and both the questions and the lists of response options are guided by preconceptions resulting from political desires or needs. The political forces may emanate from within the government machine or from interest groups that seek recognition and self-advantage. The questions and available responses, as well as the statistical and logistical methods, change over time, and the same can be true of geographical boundaries and of population identities, such as race and nationalities. However, as well as being an administrative tool, a series of censuses can act as a coalescent of the population or at least of parts of it, causing various groups within the whole to form identities in space and over time. The ability of people to classify themselves can both reinforce and create classifications with which they identify. While the above is true of all population censuses, the nature of society in British India posed particular problems. Even the geographically smaller post-Partition India contains a myriad of languages and cultures, ethnicities and religions, many of which have evolved over several millennia. The 1931 census enumerated nearly 20 per cent of the world's population, spread over ; G. Findlay Shirras said in 1935 that this was the largest such exercise in the world but \\"also the quickest and the cheapest\\". Scholars such as Bernard S. Cohn, have argued that the censuses of the Raj period significantly influenced the social and spatial demarcations within India that exist today. The use of enumerative mechanisms such as the census, which were intended to bolster the colonial presence, may indeed have sown the seeds that grew to be independent India, although not everybody accepts this. Peter Gottschalk has said of this cultural influence that: The first British attempts to analyse demographic data in a social context preceded the all-India censuses and were designed with the intent of ending the practice of female infanticide and sati, both of which were distasteful to the colonial authorities and both of which they thought to be most common among the Rajputs. The censuses that came later were much broader and, according to Crispin Bates, \\"more sophisticated\\" attempts at social engineering. Denzil Ibbetson, the Deputy Superintendent of the census in Punjab Province in 1881, said in his official report that Administrative needs were indeed a necessity and the imperative increased with a recognition that the 1857 Rebellion had been a significant challenge to Britain's presence in India. It was the shock of that which caused the end of the Company Rule and it also caused influential members of the Indian Civil Service, such as the folklorist Richard Carnac Temple, to think that, if further discontent were to be avoided, it was necessary to obtain a better understanding of the colonial subjects. The censuses formed one aspect of a wider series of ethnographic studies, the categorisations of which became an essential part of the British administrative mechanism. Of those categorisations, caste was regarded as being, \\"the cement that holds together the myriad units of Indian society,\\" according to the 1901 Census Commissioner H. H. Risley. The role of Risley has sometimes drawn particular attention, with Nicholas Dirks saying that \\"Risley's anthropology worked not so much to retard nationalism as to render it communal. In so doing, it also left a bloody legacy for South Asia that continues to exact a mounting toll.\\"  Caste  Caste and religion still form the most significant social constructs in India and the former, in particular, has been influenced by the Raj census efforts. Although there were certainly some enumerations of caste prior to the arrival of the British, some modern academics, such as Cohn and Dirks have argued that the British, through their census and other works, effectively created the caste system as it exists today. Others, such as Dipankar Gupta, reject this idea, which Gupta says implies that Indians had \\"no identity worth the name\\" prior to the colonial period, but acknowledge that the Raj had a significant role in how caste is now practised. Timothy Alborn is somewhat more sceptical, although his primary concern is to refute studies based on the theories of imagined community and objectification that have emerged from the work of Benedict Anderson. He says of the claimed objectification of caste that: From the outset in 1872, there was never a formal definition of the census categories for caste, race or tribe. As an example of this, in 1891, the Jats and Rajputs were recorded as castes and as tribes, although the category of tribe was not formally adopted until the 1901 census. The recorded details changed in every census from 1872 to 1941 and the administrators struggled to comprehend Indian culture. They relied heavily on elitist strictures through their interpretation of regional literature and on the advice of Brahmins, who subscribed to a traditional but impractical ritual ranking system, known as varna. This reliance on elites formed part of a colonial strategy to create attachment to a national identity in an arbitrarily defined, highly disparate whole. The Raj aimed to gain favour with the elites, whose position would then lead to the idea of Indian nationhood percolating through the remainder of society. Yet even the concept of Brahmanic elites is tricky: Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis has demonstrated that Bengali Brahmins were more similar to other castes in Bengal than to any Brahmin groups elsewhere. There was a general presumption that the caste of a person was immutable and unchanging, and that it could only apply to Hindus, although Jains were also thus categorised from 1901 and in 1911 the caste of Christians and Muslims was recorded if given by them. J. H. Hutton, who was Census Commissioner in 1931, said that \\"tribe was provided to cover the many communities still organised on the basis in whose case the tribe has not become a caste; it was likewise determinate enough, and no attempt was made to define the term race which was generally used so loosely as almost to defy any definition.\\" That assumptions such as immutability were inadequate was acknowledged, for example, by the 1911 Commissioner, E. A. Gait, who commented on the demonstrably obvious processes of fusion and fission in social groups that gave rise to new group identities. Similarly, Hutton noted that Hutton was observing the effects of a popular belief that the purpose of the census was to define the relative position of people in society. It was for this reason that respondents would often claim to be of a socially superior community to that which they actually were. The misconception gave an outlet for aspirational people to seek advancement and caused the evolution, sometimes almost overnight, of completely new social identities that often adopted the honorific titles of perceived superior groups \\\\- such as Brahmins, Jats and Rajputs \\\\- as part of their name. Caste associations were formed to establish the authenticity of such claims, often by inventing traditions allegedly connected to mythology and ancient history, as did the Patidars, and then they presented what Frank Conlon has described as a \\"deluge\\" of petitions for official recognition to the census authorities. Through such recognition, they thought that they could then make political and economic gains even though, as with the Goud Saraswat Brahmins (whose claim to Brahmin status itself is contested), their associations might comprise very disparate socio-economic groups. Frequently, the enumerators just took what people claimed for granted. The theories of Risley, which broadly assumed that caste and race were related, and which were based on now-discredited methods of anthropometry and scientific racism, loomed large in British attempts impose a Western paradigm on the census caste categories. The census administrators themselves also created caste communities where none existed previously. In Bengal, Chandala, which was commonly used as a generic description for all low-caste people, was mistakenly used as a specific caste name by the authorities, causing much resentment and attempts to achieve recognition as Namasudra. Castes such as Yadav and Vishwakarma appeared out of nowhere, being created as official categories for what had previously been geographically disparate, differently named communities that happened to share traditional occupations, respectively as dairymen/grazers and craft artisans such as goldsmiths and carpenters. The Yadavs were also another example of a group that invented tradition in the process often referred to as sanskritisation: they claimed descent from the mythological Yadu and a Kshatriya status that belied the commonly accepted view that they were Shudra. Their creation as a caste was aided also by the Raj policy of grouping people who bore similar names. Linguistic differences also presented difficulties, with different spellings and pronunciations for similar castes and also administrative attempts to create language-based caste categories that had previously not been known. George Grierson'a Linguistic Survey of India had recorded 179 languages and 544 dialects, while the 1931 census, which covered a somewhat more extensive area, noted 225 languages. The 1872 and 1881 censuses attempted to classify people fundamentally according to the Brahmanic varna system, which comprises the four categories of Brahmin (priest, advisor), Kshatriya (warrior, ruler), Vaishya (trader) and Shudra (labourer). This broad caste basing proved not to reflect the realities of social relationships, however much it might have met with approval from scholars of Sanskrit and ancient texts. It also did not apply throughout the country. Furthermore, as Ibbetson and others in the Punjab realised after 1872, the Brahmanic system had no practical purpose from an administrative point of view. In 1881, Punjab abandoned the primary categorisation by varna that was used in other British Indian jurisdictions in that year, preferring instead to assign more weight to the category of occupation. In 1891, the other jurisdictions followed suit. Attempts continued to recognise the broad socio- economic implications of the varna system, although these were also applied inconsistently. W. C. Plowden, the Commissioner in 1881, designated categories of Brahmans, Rajputs, Castes of Good Social Position, Inferior Castes and Non- Hindus or Aboriginal Castes; in 1921, the category of \\"depressed classes\\" was used; and in 1931 the nomenclature became \\"exterior classes\\". The 1901 census recorded 1646 distinct castes, which increased to 4147 in 1931.  Religion and occupation  The significance of religion, as well as caste, was considerable. Hutton said in his census report for 1931 that Despite the general ruling that caste was restricted to Hindus, later modified to include Jains, there were over 300 recorded Christian castes and more than 500 that were Muslim. The definition of Hindu, Sikh and Jain religious beliefs was always blurred and even the Christian and Muslim believers could cause difficulties with classification, although they were usually more easily defined. Kolis in Bombay worshipped both Hindu idols and the Christian Holy Trinity; Kunbis in Gujarat were known to follow both Hindu and Muslim rituals, causing the census to classify them as socially Hindus but Muslim by faith. The Raj had also introduced constitutional changes that gave certain groups political representation. This led to events such as that in the 1931 census when, according to Shirras:  Recording age  As with caste, recording age in the census amounted to a problematic attempt to impose Western values on the population. Most people in British India did not know their age anyway and the few who did‚Äîmostly Brahmins‚Äîwere often reluctant to divulge the information with the degree of accuracy that was commonplace in Britain and other Western countries. The nature of time had a different meaning to the people of India, who considered age to be a bureaucratic device and were more concerned with practical measures of time, such as the demarcations of natural disasters, a tendency to measure life by harvests, and the cultural impact of puberty that starkly differentiated adults from children. Other cultural influences included the zodiac and a tendency among Brahmins to understate the age of unmarried late-teenage daughters because for them not to have been married by that time implied a dereliction of parental and religious duty that would consign the parents to a torrid period between death and reincarnation. Nor were Indians much good at estimating the age of others, making it difficult for census enumerators to assess or correct the information with which they were supplied. In parallel with the introduction of censuses, the campaign to end infanticide led to the first attempts formally to register births, marriages and deaths. Legislation for that purpose was enacted between 1866 and 1872, but the system was under-resourced and reliant on village officials. Although the registration processes did improve over the years, they were significantly disrupted at times, notably when officials were pre- occupied in dealing with famines and, from the 1920s onward, by the actions of the Indian independence movement. The problems of registration and of age irrelevance and ignorance were known to the census authorities, whose officials produced tables that demonstrated statistically implausible spikes and age distributions from the 1880s onward. They came to recognise that the issues were exacerbated by a misunderstanding, with the populace often being unconvinced that the submitted data was not used at a personal level but rather aggregated for analysis. These issues could not easily be corrected because there were also significant variances caused by periodic outbreaks of famine and diseases such as cholera and influenza, as well as the very imperfect system of registering life-events. Attempts at correction were made but the figures remained unreliable throughout the Raj period and, perhaps worse, the attempts to correct them in the official reports were not always based on sound methodology. Amartya Sen is among those who have been criticised for allegedly failing to appreciate the underlying statistical problems in the published data. Noting that some of these officials queried even trying to impose the age category, Alborn says that  Outcomes  The outcomes of the census exercise were sometimes startling. For example, the 1872 census in Bengal suggested that the population was considerably greater than had been believed. A supervisor there noted that it \\"... rose in one day from 42 to 67 millions\\" and that the Lieutenant-Governor \\"suddenly found that he had unconsciously been the ruler of an additional population more than equal to that of the whole of England and Wales.\\" Proposed benefits such as improvements in public health and targeted famine relief, however, were often not realised, in these particular instances because the poor data relating to age (mortality rates, as an example) prevented the sort of mapping of the population that, over time, was improving the well-being of the British populace. The Journal of the Statistical Society of London said that the 1872 census \\"must be regarded more as a creditable, and in the main successful attempt to deal with an exceptionally difficult subject, than as a complete or reliable statement of a class of facts.\\" Among the problems, noted as \\"surely ... some grave error\\", was the seemingly inexplicable figure for the \\"diseased and starved\\" population in Orissa, which had suffered a famine that was estimated to have caused the deaths of around a third of its three million people but whose numbers within five years exceeded the pre-famine total. The information provided for religion was described as \\"not altogether reliable, the Hindoos being probably over-estimated, the Mahomedans under-rated, and with the exceptions of the Christians, the Jews, and the Parsees, the remainder being more or less conjectural.\\" The figures for caste and nationality were also described as \\"for the most part conjectural\\". The 1872 census was, in the opinion of Crispin Bates, That caste should not be treated as a fixed designation is now commonly recognised: new groups come and go, and there are movements between groups. Bhagat describes them as \\"fluid, fuzzy and dynamic historically\\" and gives as an example the emergence in the early 20th century of the Kamma and Reddy castes through coalescence of like-minded, politically motivated groups. Despite its variability, the published information relating to age caused significant angst among social reformers, notably in relation to the Child Marriage Restraint Act (Sarda Act) of 1929. This legislation had been supported by the 1931 Census Commissioner, Hutton, who had noticed a declining trend in the custom of child marriages and saw the act as encouraging that. Eleanor Rathbone, a prominent campaigner for women's rights and a believer that the Raj authorities were not getting to grips with Indian social issues, used figures from the 1931 census to support her misguided claim that such marriages were not in decline and that the act had in fact caused a significant spike in the numbers. She claimed that there had been a 50 per cent increase in wives under the age of 15 and a quadrupling of wives under 5 years old since 1921, and that the lives of women were being blighted. She thought Indians incapable of helping themselves and in need of firmer instruction from British authorities, who should enforce change rather than merely encourage it. In turn, debates such as these, based on untrustworthy information, informed opinions about Indian nationalism and the role of Britain generally in the country. Rathbone herself was confronted by Rama Rau, an Indian feminist, who said that the British were simply not well- placed to understand Indian culture and that \\"educated Indian women were working in every province of their country to eradicate social evils and outmoded customs and prejudices, and we refused to accept the assertion that the removal of social evils in Indian society was the responsibility of the British.\\"  See also  *Government of India Act 1858  References  Notes Citations Bibliography         Further reading   Category:Government of British India Category:History of the Indian government Category:Censuses in India Category:Censuses in Pakistan Category:Ethnology ","title":"Census of India prior to independence"},{"id":"42338430","text":"KPTY may refer to: * KPTY (AM), a radio station (1330 AM) licensed to serve Waterloo, Iowa, United States * KXXF, a radio station (105.3 FM) licensed to serve Winnie, Texas, United States, which held the call sign KPTY from 2009 to 2014 * KQBU-FM, a radio station (93.3 FM) licensed to serve Port Arthur, Texas, which held the call sign KPTY from 2007 to 2009 * KAMA-FM, a radio station (104.9 FM) licensed to serve Deer Park, Texas, which held the call sign KPTY from 2001 to 2007 * KOMR, a radio station (106.3 FM) licensed to serve Sun City, Arizona, United States, which held the call sign KPTY in 2001 * KZON, a radio station (103.9 FM) licensed to serve Gilbert, Arizona, which held the call sign KPTY from 1997 to 2001 * KAMX, a radio station (94.7 FM) licensed to serve Luling, Texas, which held the call sign KPTY from 1994 to 1995 ","title":"KPTY"},{"id":"42338435","text":"Keith Rae may refer to: * Keith Rae (British Army officer) (1919‚Äì2010) * Keith Rae (footballer) (born 1917), former Australian rules footballer ","title":"Keith Rae"},{"id":"42338447","text":"The Krigwa Players (also known as the Krigwa Players Little Negro Theatre and named for the acronym CRIGWA: Crisis Guild of Writers and Artists) was one of the most prominent and popular theatre groups based out of Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance. Though it only lasted for three years, The Krigwa Players' impact was felt throughout Harlem and the cities it spawned offshoot projects into, these cities being Cleveland, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and even Philadelphia. It was founded in 1925 by W.E.B. Du Bois and Regina Anderson, with Du Bois serving as the chairman of the theater group entirely. The theatre was converted from the basement of the 135th street Harlem Library. The goal of the company was focusing on creating, nurturing, developing, and promoting new writers, directors, performers, and actors within the black community.  Mission  W.E.B. Du Bois published a statement concerning the objective of the Krigwa Players in the NAACP magazine The Crisis  Association with The Crisis magazine  Starting in 1924, Amy Spingarn (wife of Joel Elias Spingarn) established an annual literary contest in The Crisis. Accepting submissions for fiction, essays, verse, and plays, this contest became the major source of new work for the Krigwa Players.Walker, Ethel Pitts. \\"Krigwa, a Theatre by, for, and about Black People.\\" Theatre Journal, Vol. 40, No. 3, Perspectives in Theatre History (Oct., 1988), pp. 347-356  Productions  = First season (1926) = The Krigwa Players' first official season was performed at the 135th Street branch of the New York Public Library in May 1926,http://credo.library.umass.edu/view/pageturn/mums312-b034-i165/#page/1/mode/1up and consisted of two one-acts plays selected as winners of the literary contest in The Crisis, The Broken Banjo by Willis Richardson and The Church Fight by Ruth Ada Gaines-Shelton, and a third one-act by Richardson \\"Compromise\\". It consistently played to full houses, with an average of 200 patrons per night. The entire production cost $165 and made back $240 in ticket sales, netting the company a modest profit. = Second season (1927) = With the second annual Crisis awards in 1926, one of the winning plays was selected to be part of the three one-acts; Eulalie Spence's Foreign Mail. The other two were a second play by Spence entitled Her and Mandy by W.J. Jefferson. This season also introduced a new interpretive dance and dialogue by J. Gord Arnold entitled Pandora's Box. Unfortunately none of the scripts for this season have survived over the years preventing analysis of the works. = Fifth Annual National Little Theatre Tournament (1927) = The company's biggest success came after entering Eulalie Spence's Fool's Errand into the Fifth Annual National Theatre Tournament. The production won the Samuel French for Best Unpublished Play and garnered the company a prize of $200. A huge success considering that this was the company's first time entering such a tournament.  Decline and legacy  The company became sharply split after the tournament. W.E.B. Du Bois used the prize money to pay for the cost of the production and entering the tournament with no money going towards the performers. After this the company parted and went their separate ways. According to Eulalie Spence, the last official production of the Krigwa Players was Fool's Errand. Another group using the name Krigwa Players name emerged in 1928, but they were not affiliated with The Crisis or the original Krigwa Players. The legacy of the theater lead to subsequent groups filling the space after its closure, with some being the Negro Experimental Players (1929), the Harlem Players (1931), and the American Negro Theater, which lasted 9 years, and ran the longest out of all the former theater companies.

German forces occupied Montenegro, along with Albania, and the territory remained under German occupation until Axis forces evacuated in December 1944. During the occupation the area was administered with Wilhelm Keiper as the general representative.

The Germans and their local collaborators in Montenegro fought against the Yugoslav Partisans. After the Germans withdrew from the Montenegro and evacuated towards Austria, the fascist leader Sekula Drljeviƒá attempted to create a government-in-exile in the neighbouring Independent State of Croatia (NDH), which was a German quasi-protectorate.

It supports wildlife projects and it campaigns on animal rights issues in Britain and around the world. History Care for the Wild International was set up by Dr Bill Jordan in 1984 from his bookshop in Horsham, West Sussex in the United Kingdom. As the charity grew, it moved to new premises but it is still based in Horsham. It is now an international organisation with an annual income of over ¬£700,000, using the money to fund projects and campaigns both in the United Kingdom and overseas. Mission The stated aim of Care for the Wild International is to \\"rescue, protect and defend animals in need around the globe\\". It helps fund rescue centres and animal sanctuaries caring for abandoned, injured and orphaned wild animals in the United Kingdom and in Africa. It operates an \\"adoption\\" scheme under which donors can target their donations towards specific objectives. Protection of wildlife is done through supporting projects such as anti-poaching patrols and campaigns against the use of snares. It seeks to educate people about the importance of their local wildlife and on the way to minimise conflicts between people and animals. Care for the Wild International joins with other campaigning organisations to try to defend the rights of animals, taking part in both local actions, such as opposing badger culling, and international actions to limit the trade in endangered species. Projects and campaigns The stance of Care for the Wild International on the poaching of elephants is backed by its funding of anti- poaching patrols and an elephant orphanage coupled with a re-release programme. This it does in association with the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in Kenya which manages an orphanage for motherless elephants and rhinoceroses. In April 2005, Care for the Wild International joined with the Wildlife Trust of India to confront the 14th Dalai Lama about the trade in tiger skins in Tibet, a campaign that changed attitudes in Tibet on the use of tiger pelts as clothing. Another campaign has endeavoured to prevent the sale of live turtles as food at Tesco supermarkets in China. Other campaigns have targeted the poaching of rhinoceroses for their horns, and the trade in ivory in the United States which imports large quantities of illegal ivory from poached elephants and which CITES has described as an \\"ivory trade problem country\\". Care for the Wild International has joined with the Center for Biological Diversity to produce a report \\"Extinction: It‚Äôs Not Just for Polar Bears\\" which describes the effects that climate change is having on the Arctic. The report describes the changes taking place in the Arctic and what species are affected. It also provides an action plan for mitigating the problem. Other scientific reports have covered the ivory trade, the Chinese fur industry, the fate of tigers, the evidence supporting badger culling, the impact that hunting bushmeat has on primate populations and the management of elephants in South Africa.

The work originated as the first movement of a planned Revolutionary Symphony inspired by the July Revolution. Liszt pays homage in this programmatic symphonic poem to the soldiers and men that died fighting in revolutionary efforts. The composition of this piece was started in 1830 as a brief sketch for a full symphony, but was dropped by Liszt in the continuing of other works. However, in 1848, there was an uprising in Liszt's home country of Hungary. One of Liszt's friends was killed during this revolution, which caused Liszt to revisit his now 20 year old sketch of the Revolutionary Symphony, shortening it and forming the first movement into the commemorative H√©ro√Øde fun√®bre. Liszt said of the program, \\"In these successive wars and carnages, sinister sports, whatever be the colours of the flags which rise proudly and boldly against each other, on both sides they float soaked with heroic blood and inexhaustible tears. It is for Art to throw her ennobling veil over the tomb of the brave, to encircle with her golden halo the dead and dying, that they may be the envy of the living.\\"  Sound and Form  H√©ro√Øde fun√®bre takes the form of a funeral march, divided up into several sections. The work relies heavily on the use of Hungarian chordal structure and scales, as well as the use of a field snare that introduces the ominous draw of this highly expressive march. It is written in the relative minor of Ab, otherwise known as the key of F minor. The first section states the main theme, which is a combination of Hungarian melodies and droning low strings to create a longing cry for those deceased. This theme is passed around the winds and strings of the orchestra, and at times there is a soft accompaniment of bells and chimes, indicating the tolling of funeral bells. These bells come back stronger near the end of the section in tandem with a rapid succession of chromatic notes played by the strings, adding to the tone of absolute devastation at the loss of friends and allies. The section comes to a close with a restatement of the rolling snare, restating the idea of a military funeral. The next section is much less anguished in tone, instead relying on a hauntingly nostalgic melody in the upper winds to portray the sorrow felt at the loss. In this section, Liszt also introduces a theme played on the brass that heavily reassembles a part of La Marseillaise, the national anthem of France. In the third and final section, Liszt restates the dramatic theme from the beginning, as well as including small bursts of hopeful moments taken from the second section and La Marseillaise. Finally, the piece ends with sombre chorale-like chords in the key of F minor and the rolling of the snare that started the piece.

History Trinity Church, originally known as Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church, was the first Lutheran church in Altenburg, and was established by Gotthold Heinrich Loeber (1797-1849) in a log cabin in 1839. This log cabin, also utilized as a school building, was moved to a new site in 1912, and in 1979 was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The cornerstone for the second church building was laid on March 14, 1844. This limestone building, which was both a school and a church, was completed in 1845, under Pastor Loeber. He helped start the Lutheran School and Seminary at Altenburg, which was functioning by 1841 and possibly as early as 1839. This school ultimately developed into Concordia Seminary. Carl Ferdinand Wilhelm Walther helped organize the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod in 1847, was its first president, and was involved in the relocation of the seminary to St. Louis in 1849. The second church building of Trinity was dedicated in 1845. This one story structure served as the parish church until 1867, when the present church was built. Thereafter it served as a school for the upper grades for 102 years until 1969, when a new school was dedicated. Following the construction of the new school, the original limestone church was converted into a museum that displays local church items. The present church building, dedicated in 1867, also served as convention headquarters for the Western District of the LCMS on nine occasions. The altar, pulpit, and baptismal font are original furnishings of 1867. The crucifix on the altar was made in Oberammergau, Germany, and was brought along in 1839, as were the baptismal tray and pitcher, both dated 1838. Georg Albert Schieferdecker (1815-1891) took over as pastor of Trinity in 1850 after Loeber's death the previous year. Schieferdecker became involved in the Chiliasm (German Chiliastenstreit) schism in 1857-1858, resulting in his expulsion from the LCMS. Upon his expulsion, one third of the membership followed him to found Immanuel Lutheran Church, which was associated with the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Iowa. The third church building was constructed under the direction of J. P. Beyer. The cornerstone for this church was laid in 1866. Stone was hauled by horse-drawn wagon from Bodenshatz Branch creek, east of the church site. The third church was dedicated in 1867. The design of the church with the pulpit situated above the altar is typical 18th century German style church architecture. The specific model for Trinity is said to have been St. John's Lutheran Church in New Minden, Illinois. The total cost of the church was $15,280.60, which was not paid off until 1878. A new clapboard roof of 26,000 clapboards was constructed in 1887 for $356.25. The tin ceiling in the church was installed in 1894 for $400. The name of the church was officially changed from the Evangelical Lutheran Brethren, U.A.C., to Trinity Lutheran Brethren, U.A.C., in 1918. A severe storm struck the area and the church on May 8, 2009, destroying the church‚Äôs steeple. The steeple was replaced on September 30, 2009, at a cost between $160,000 and $170,000. Heritage Center Heritage Center The Lutheran Heritage Center and Museum was constructed in 2005. The Museum interprets the 1838-39 Saxon Lutheran immigration from Germany to Perry County, Missouri, including the history of the seven original German colonies. It also follows the origins of the Lutheran Church in eastern Perry County and the regional German-American culture. The museum features the original limestone church that served as the parish church until 1867, and thereafter as the ‚ÄúBig School‚Äù for the upper grades until 1969. The center and museum also feature a genealogical research center. http://www.greatriveroad.com http://www.greatriverroad.com/meetohio/altenburg.htm Concordia College Concordia College's history goes back to Martin Stephan and the Saxon Lutheran Immigration of 1838-39. This unique migration was made up of Germans, principally from the Kingdom of Saxony, who had embraced the teachings of Martin Stephan. From his pulpit in St. John's Church in Dresden he preached an orthodox brand of Lutheranism that ran counter to the trend of rationalism that was prevent in the State Church of Saxony.http://www.dnr.mo.gov https://www.dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps-nr/78001671.pdf Concordia College Cabin The log cabin dates to the first settlement of Altenburg. Constructed in 1839, it served as the first school for the new community. It is located in the maple grove across from the Trinity Lutheran Church and contains museum exhibits relevant to the history of Altenburg. It was moved to its present location in 1912. The vertical oak timbers were attached to the walls to stabilize the structure. The chimney was removed from the cabin at that time. The shelter providing protection over the cabin was constructed in 1915. The cabin is constructed of oak logs which are only crudely shaped, and have only slight notching. The chinking between the logs is mainly mortar and bricks, and some stone.

He had 82 films from 1940 to 1974. Oscar History Both of these were for Best Special Effects. *19th Academy Awards- Blithe Spirit. Won. *31st Academy Awards-tom thumb. Won. Biography Tom Howard (born in Kent on 27 March 1910) was an esteemed British special effects artist who gained especial prestige for his work in the 1940s ‚Äì 1960s, in what is considered the golden age of Hollywood filmmaking. Initially starting out as a theatre-projectionist ‚Äì the cinema equivalent of a water boy ‚Äì Howard would transition to Denham Studios, working under the tutelage of Alexandra Korda, a Hungarian film director who would have a profound impact on the evolution of Howard's career. Howard would become a key player in the production of many of Korda's films, including the perennial classic Lawrence of Arabia, dreaming up (alongside Lawrence Butler) the earliest innovations of impressive photographic effects that would eventually net him an Oscar for his work in David Lean's Blithe Spirit (1945). By 1945, his prestigious innovations would come to the attention of MGM, who would end up appointing him as Director of Visual Effects for their British Studios division, located in Borehamwood, a town in Southern Hertfordshire, UK. There, he would be responsible for many effects that are still celebrated as some of the most memorable work in the business today, demonstrating a pioneering eye for practical effects, use of space, and iconic visual imagery. His most notable works include the burning of Rome in Mervyn LeRoy's Quo Vadis and many of the effects shots that made Stanley Kubrick‚Äôs 2001: A Space Odyssey such a beloved film. His tenure at the British offices of MGM Entertainment would last 15 years. In 1958, Howard would win his sophomore Academy Award for his involvement with George Pal‚Äôs Tom Thumb at the 31st Academy Award ceremony, and continue to work on many films, including The Haunting, Where Eagles Dare, et al. A quiet, unassuming man, he made his home near the MGM studios in the village of Bushey where he and his wife, Dorothy, brought up their children, and the only sign of his illustrious film reputation were the doorstops to his study and the dining room which, on closer inspection, turned out to be his Oscars. By the time of his retirement, Howard would have touched as many as 150 motion pictures, and have accomplished work on 85 of them. Howard died in his home in Bushey, Hertfordshire, from a stroke on 30 August 1985, at the age of 75. On 2001: A Space Odyssey Tom Howard was known to have a consistent working relationship with the legendary Stanley Kubrick, regarded by many as one of the greatest original filmmakers of all time. He would serve as special effects advisor on Kubrick‚Äôs \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\". Combining optical and mechanical effects, the special effects that Howard, Kubrick, and other experts refined and collaborated on *\\"multiplied technical innovations: the intensive use of front projection for the landscapes in \\"The Dawn of Man\\" or the invention of stepping motors servo-controlled by computer for moving the spaceships.\\" Appearances As an individual who was always behind the camera, Howard rarely gave televised interviews. However, in the late 1970s, he was featured in an extended two-part interview on the program Clapperboard, hosted by Chris Kelly, where he discussed his experiences in Hollywood and the magic of visual effects. Otherwise, the only other times he could be persuaded to talk about his work were to cine film clubs or to local youth groups; when speaking to the latter he would usually begin by saying \\"I'm very old so you probably won't have heard of any of the people I've worked with\\" before going on to name people like Rex Harrison, Richard Burton, Stanley Kubrick, David Lean, etc. At the end of such talks he might show off one of his Oscars, usually transported in a teatowel. Other works Tom Howard was also a \\"founding member of the British Society of Cinematographers and a fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and Britain‚Äôs Cinematograph, Sound and Television Society.\\" In 1967, he would invent a variation on Front Projection Composite Cinematography. This patent would be widely influential on the process of filmmaking.

Biography  charcoal, Civic museum of Crema Marazzi was the daughter of Antonio Marazzi, a diplomat and anthropologist. She was also the niece of Fortunato Marazzi, a soldier, writer and senator. Marazzi was born in Lugano, Switzerland, where his father was on duty. She began to paint as a child. In 1901 her talent brought her under the tutelage of Giuseppe Ferrari in his atelier in Rome. In 1905 her health began to fail and she was misdiagnosed with tuberculosis. She had complex surgery and then left Rome to recover in her family villa in Moscazzano, near Crema. Further health problems forced her to come back to Rome for additional treatment. Unfortunately, she died in surgery at the age of twenty-six.C.

In May 1536, a musician of the royal household, Mark Smeaton, the courtiers Henry Norris, Sir Francis Weston, William Brereton, as well as the queen's brother, George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford, were tried and executed for treason and adultery with Anne Boleyn, the second wife of Henry VIII. Lancelot de Carle was in London at the time, and was an eyewitness to Anne's trial and execution. The poem, dated 2 June 1536, details the life and the dramatic events surrounding the arrest, trial and execution of Anne Boleyn, and those accused with her.

It was conceived in the 1960s. Sample sizes range depending on the specific Griggs apparatus but generally can be up to approximately 150 mm3, and temperatures of up to 1600 K along with pressures of approximately 3 GPa can be achieved.  History  The Griggs apparatus was conceived by David Griggs in the mid 1960s during his time at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). Since the inception of the Griggs apparatus it has become the work horse of many rock deformation labs world-wide, and has also helped elucidate numerous facets of plastic deformation in crystalline materials including the hydrolytic weakening of quartz.  Theory  The Griggs machine utilizes the same principle that other high pressure apparatuses (such as the diamond anvil cell) use to create elevated pressure on a specimen. By generating a nominal force, in the case of the Griggs machine through a hydraulic ram, a greater force can then be applied to the sample by decreasing the area of subsequent pistons in series with the ram and in contact with the sample.  Sample assembly  Example of one experimental sample assembly for a Griggs machine The sample assembly is constructed of multiple cylindrical sleeves which are placed in the opening in the pressure vessel or ‚Äúbomb‚Äù. The outermost sleeve is typically composed from NaCl which is used to transfer the vertical load applied from the steel piston into a confining pressure on the sample at the center of the assembly. NaCl is used since it is relatively weak and it assists in the transfer of stress. Directly inboard of the outer NaCl sleeve is a ceramic support sleeve with a graphite sleeve inside of it, which is used for resistive heating of the sample. The inner most sleeve which houses the sample along with the upper and lower alumina pistons, is commonly also composed of NaCl. In addition to this arrangement, the inner sleeve can also be composed of a ternary eutectic salt mixture which is called a molten salt cell. The advantage to the molten salt cell is the salt mixture melts at moderate temperatures which allows for a true hydrostatic pressure to be applied the sample. When using a molten salt cell it also becomes necessary to add an additional nickel capsule to contain the salt mixture in order to prevent damage to other parts of the sample assembly. Temperature is monitored by a side entry thermocouple(s) that penetrate the wall of the graphite furnace and are directly adjacent to the sample, and are typically threaded through protective mullite insulation. The deviatoric stress is transferred to the sample through the œÉ1 piston. This piston is orientated in series with the upper piston, sample and lower piston within the inner sleeve which all sits on top of a tungsten carbide bottom piston.  Design  Expanded view of the outer (œÉ3) and inner (œÉ1) pistons.A Griggs apparatus has the ability to create and maintain confining pressure on a sample while separately being able to strain the sample. Confining pressure is generated by advancing a hydraulic ram either by using a hand-operated lever pump or a servo-controlled syringe pump. The advancing ram then compresses the outer tungsten carbide piston (œÉ3) that in turn depresses the Pb plug at the top of the sample assembly and then in turn stresses the NaCl pressure medium. Deviatoric stress is created by a mechanical drive train that is powered by an electric motor that sits on top of the apparatus. When the electric motor is powered it engages with a set of gears that allow for variable strain rates to be chosen that range from 10‚àí3sec-1 down to 10‚àí8sec-1. To eliminate the torque from the advancing drive train produced by the gear set, a recirculating ball screw is located in between the gear set and deformation piston (œÉ1) that provides the axial load. Connected in series with the deformation piston is also an external load cell which measures the load applied to the inner (œÉ1). The outer (œÉ3) and inner (œÉ1) pistons that sit above the sample are two separate pieces, this allows for the advancement of the deformation piston with the drive train without altering the confining pressure which is operated with the hydraulic ram. The design of the hydraulic ram produces an error in pressure measurements that are calculated from utilizing the oil pressure within the ram. Inside of the ram there is a large O-ring that seals oil in either the upper or lower portion of the ram. As the ram is pressurized and oil is transferred from the lower reservoir to the upper friction is produced by the motion of the O-ring along the inside wall of the ram. Since the ram needs to overcome the force of the friction to continue advancing, pressure measurements calculated using the oil pressure within the ram includes a contribution from the internal friction. The contribution of frictional force on pressure calculations can be described by the following relationship: Calculated pressure = Confining pressure + Internal friction within the ram. The total contribution of this friction to the value of measured pressure is different for each specific Griggs machine, but it has been shown that deviations between actual and measured pressure can be up to 10%.

The case was heard 20 March 1866 before Lord Penzance, and established the common law definition of marriage.Hyde v. Hyde and Woodmansee {L.R.} 1 P. & D. 130. Facts of the case John Hyde, an English Mormon who had been ordained to the priesthood of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church),John Hyde Jr. was born about 1833 and converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in 1848. He was married to Lavinia Hawkins by Brigham Young and worked as a missionary to France. In 1856 he had a change of heart and began to oppose Mormon teaching and left the LDS Church. In his later years. he campaigned in opposition to the LDS Church. He died in 1876. brought an action of divorce against his wife, Lavinia,Lavinia, re- married and died on 1 April 1910. for adultery. He had left the LDS Church and began to write and publish anti-Mormon material, a move that caused him to be excommunicated from the LDS Church. His wife left him, and subsequently remarried in Utah Territory, which was the basis for his suit. Judgement Citing Warrender v. Warrender,Warrender v. Warrender 2 Cl. & F. 531. [*135]. Lord Penzance found that institutions in foreign countries (including marriage) cannot be considered as valid under English law, unless they resemble the equivalent English institution. With respect to marriage, English law could therefore not recognise either polygamy or concubinage as marriage. Similarly, he found that cultural traditions of which the court had no knowledge could not form the basis for a court decision.Ardaseer Cursetjee v. Perozeboye 10 Moo. P. C. 375, 419. The court dismissed John Hyde's claim. The case established the common law definition of marriage. Lord Penzance pronounced: :\\"I conceive that marriage, as understood in Christendom, may for this purpose be defined as the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others\\". Hyde v Hyde casenote . Significance This definition has been an influential consideration in a number of recent landmark decisions, including Same-Sex Marriage,re Same-Sex Marriage [2004] 3 S.C.R. 698, 2004 SCC 79. Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza,Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza [2004] UKHL 30. Wilkinson v. Kitzinger and OthersWilkinson v Kitzinger [2006] EWHC 2022 (Fam). and the ACT Same Sex Marriage case in Australia. In addition, the phraseology has had a direct influence on numerous pieces of legislation, including the Civil Partnership Act 2004 (UK), the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (UK), the Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977, and the Australian Marriage Act of 1961.Commonwealth v ACT (2013) Since 2014, when the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 (UK) came into force allowing same-sex marriages in England and Wales, the common-law definition of marriage is now moot, as did the 2017 amendment to the Australian Marriage Act 1961 by Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017. Criticism  The heavy reliance on Lord Penzance's definition of marriage has been criticised on two distinct grounds. First, the original statement was an obiter dictum, meaning it did not establish a binding precedent. Second, this dictum was a defence of marriage and not a definition of it.Rebecca Probert, \\"Hyde v Hyde: Defining or Defending Marriage\\", Child and Family Law Quarterly, vol. 9. no. 3, 2007, pp. 322‚Äì336.

The Chief Justice delivered directions as to how the governor-general should proceed to take any action he considers to be appropriate under Section 116(1) of the Constitution, acting in his own deliberate judgment, rather than as advised by the cabinet. That is, the governor-general could consider whether it was appropriate to exercise his reserve powers in calling parliament. Teonea v.

The administration of the court is set out in the Superior Courts Act (1987) and in the Court of Appeal Rules (2009). The Court of Appeal of Tuvalu determined appeals for the first time in 2009. Tomkins, Fisher and Paterson JJA (judges from New Zealand) were appointed to decide two cases: * Falefou v. Esau [2009] TVCA 1. * Teonea v. Pule o Kaupule of Nanumaga [2009] TVCA 2. Falefou v. Esau Falefou v. Esau was an appeal from a judgment of Donne CJ given in the High Court on 27 August 1991. Donne CJ dismissed an appeal from the Lands Appeal Panel which rejected that the appellant, who had been adopted according to native custom, was entitled to the transfer of all the lands and pits held by the person (who died intestate), who had adopted the appellant. The Court of Appeal rejected the appeal; deciding that ‚ÄúThe Tuvalu Land Code is a code for disposing of an intestate‚Äôs land. In the Court‚Äôs view distributions are to be made in accordance with the Code. It supersedes customary law. Section 5(2) of the laws of Tuvalu Court provide that customary law does not take effect if it is inconsistent with an Act. In this instance the customary law is inconsistent with the Tuvalu Land Code.‚Äù Teonea v. Pule o Kaupule of Nanumaga Teonea v. Pule o Kaupule of Nanumaga was an appeal from a judgment of Ward CJ given in the High Court on 11 October 2005. The case raised issues in relation to the balancing the freedoms of religion, expression and association that are set out in the Constitution of Tuvalu against the values of Tuvaluan culture and social stability that are also referred to in the Constitution. The dispute arose in July 2003 when the Falekaupule (the traditional assembly of elders) of Nanumaga passed a resolution that had the effect of banning the Brethren Church from seeking converts in Nanumaga. The Falekaupule had decided that the preaching of the Brethren Church was causing division in the Nanumaga community. Mase Teonea, a pastor in the Brethren Church, sought a declaration that the resolution of the Falekaupule was null and void as contrary to the Constitution, in that the resolution was contrary to: section 23(1) of the Constitution of Tuvalu 1986 as it hinders freedom of belief and worship; section 24(1) and 25(1) in so far that it limited the freedom of expression, and freedom of association of the church members; and that the resolution was discriminatory and contrary to section 27(1) in so far that it treated the applicant in a way that gives him and his church congregation less favourable treatment than other such groups and persons. The judgement of Ward CJ balanced the freedoms of religion, expression and association against the values of Tuvaluan stability and culture, with the Chief Justice accepting the evidence of the unrest and tension on Nanumaga. The decision of the Chief Justice was to refuse to grant the declaration sought by Mase Teonea. The approach to the constitutional questions that the Court of Appeal should take was described by Paterson JA who stated: :‚Äúit is my view that it is for the Court to determine whether the circumstances are such that it is necessary to regulate or place some restriction on the exercise of the rights at issue in this case. The balancing act requires a consideration of the importance of the freedoms in question and whether it is necessary to regulate or place some restrictions on the exercise of those freedoms if the exercise: :[a] may be divisive, unsettling or offensive to the people; or :[b] may directly threaten Tuvaluan values or culture. :Section 29(5) of the Constitution makes it clear that a restriction may be lawful even if it restricts religious freedom, if the exercise of the rights would lead to the results specified in section 29(4). This provision is subject to sections 12 and 15 which provides that any restriction must be reasonably justifiable in a democratic society that has a proper respect for human rights and dignity when considered in the light of the circumstances existing at the time.‚Äù The majority judgments of Fisher and Paterson JJA allowed the appeal, so that the judgment of the Chief Justice was set aside. The Court of Appeal made the declaration that the resolution of the Falekaupule of 4 July 2003 was contrary to the Constitution. Tomkins JA provided a minority opinion in which he agreed with the decision of the Chief Justice and would have dismissed the appeal. Appeals to the Privy Council The Constitution of Tuvalu establishes that in respect of decisions of the Court of Appeal there is a right of appeal to Her Majesty in Council, i.e., the Privy Council in London. No appeals have been made to the Privy Council from Tuvalu.

The restaurant uses a J&R; Oyler Pit, named \\"Black Betty\\", salvaged from a KC Masterpiece restaurant. The smoker can cook 1,400 pounds of meat at a time, using a mix of apple, hickory, and black cherry wood. B.T.'s Smokehouse pick-up counter in April 2019. Introduction B.T.'s Smokehouse is a barbeque restaurant in Sturbridge, Massachusetts. The restaurant was founded by Brian Treitman in April 2007 in a roadside trailer next to the Brimfield Antiques Fair. After achieving initial success, B.T.‚Äôs was later expanded to occupy the 40-seat establishment that serves as the current location in Sturbridge, Massachusetts. B.T.'s has been credited in The Boston Globe as one of the ‚Äú10 places to bask in barbecue‚Äù. B.T.‚Äôs started offering catering services for weddings and events in 2008. Management Brian Treitman graduated from The Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York and had his internship with Ming Tsai's restaurant, Blue Ginger, in Wellesley, Massachusetts. Later he worked as a chef in various Napa County, California restaurants for more than 10 years. Treitman also worked as a chef in Ken Oringer‚Äôs KO Prime in Boston before starting B.T.'s. Treitman lists Jacques P√©pin and Julia Child as the chefs who were his primary influencers. Treitman was selected by the Worcester Business Journal as one of their \\"40 Under Forty\\" young business professionals for 2016. Menu Focusing on Southern-style cuisine, the menu offers natural grass-fed beef, chicken, pork, and other meats that have been dry rubbed and slow smoked for up to 14 hours with local apple and hickory woods. Treitman makes his own sauces as well as his own ketchup from scratch. In addition to standard barbecue fare, the restaurant also offers more unusual entrees such as smoked salmon, chili made with brisket meat, and smoked turkey and chicken. Awards and accolades B.T.'s Smokehouse has earned numerous awards and prizes since 2007. =Food awards= In the fall of 2015, the British chef and restaurateur Gordon Ramsay stopped by the smokehouse for a brisket sandwich. Ramsay said he had heard about the restaurant while filming an episode of Hotel Hell in nearby Southbridge, Massachusetts and it was recommended he stop by for a visit. Ramsay said the brisket was \\"perfect\\".Brisket quote sourced from an interview with the owner. Environmentalism and sustainability The restaurant obtains much of their produce from local area farms and the Pioneer Valley Growers Association. The smokehouse recycles all meat grease and vegetable oil used in the restaurant by sending the refuse to a local rendering plant. The grease from the meat is rendered into industrial soaps and cleaners and the vegetable oil is turned into bio-diesel fuel. All of the take-out materials and cups, plates, and utensils are biodegradable. The cups are made from corn, most of the utensils are made from potato starch, and the take-out materials are made from bamboo rather than the foam material used in the majority of barbecue restaurants.

It is popularly known as \\"Manadonese cuisine\\" after Manado, the capital of the province, although other cities in North Sulawesi, such as Bitung, Tomohon and Tondano, are also known as Minahasan culinary hotspots. Manadonese cuisine is known for its rich variations in seafood, generous amount of spices, extra-hot condiments, exotic meats, and European-influenced cakes and pastries. Popular Manadonese dishes include tinutuan (Manado-style vegetable and rice congee), cakalang fufu (smoked skipjack tuna), cakalang noodle, paniki (spiced fruit bat), chicken or various fish and seafood spiced in rica-rica or woku spices, chicken tuturuga, and brenebon. Although not as popular and as widely distributed as Padang food and Sundanese cuisine, there is increasing awareness of Manadonese cuisine in the Indonesian cuisine scene. Numbers of Manadonese restaurants are growing in Indonesian cities such as Jakarta, Bandung, Medan, Surabaya and Makassar. Traditions and influences Manadonese cuisine is marked by a mixture of native and foreign influences. Native Minahasan cooking tradition relies heavily on seafood as well as exotic bushmeats, and its heavy use of freshly chopped hot spices. It also demonstrates Chinese and European influences (especially Portuguese and Dutch), most prominent in soups, cakes, and pastries. Chicken and beef are commonly consumed. A significant number of Minahasans are Christians; the halal dietary law has thus not played an important role in the cuisine's development as it has for the Minahasans' Muslim neighbors on the Sulawesi island (the Gorontalos and Northern Maluku people). Pork, wild boar, and even dog meat and bat are hence more ubiquitous in Manadonese cuisine compared to other culinary traditions in the Indonesian archipelago. Spices Hot and spicy dabu-dabu condiment Manadonese cuisine is well known for its generous use of spices, sometimes making up more than half of the whole dish's ingredients. It has given the cuisine the reputation of being hot and spicy, often from the freshly chopped chili peppers added in. Common spices used in Manadonese cuisine include lemongrass, lime or citrus leaves, lime juice, chili peppers, spring onion, shallots, garlic, clove and candlenut. Seafood, pork and chicken are often cooked in Manadonese signature bumbu (spice blends), such as rica-rica and woku. Spicy condiments are also served as dipping sauce for seafood, such as dabu-dabu and sambal roa. Cakes and pastries Klappertaart or coconut custard Among Indonesian ethnicities, Minahasans are well known for their affinities with European culture. A number of European-influenced cakes and pastries made their way into the Minahasan kitchen. The most notable probably is klappertaart (from Dutch language, lit. coconut tart). Another example is panada, a Portuguese-influenced pan (bread) similar to empanadas and filled with spiced ground skipjack tuna. Seafood Cakalang fufu, cured and smoked skipjack tuna Minahassa Peninsula ‚Äì the northern arm of Sulawesi, a narrow peninsula that formed the North Sulawesi and Gorontalo provinces ‚Äì are surrounded by seas in almost all sides. Minahasan people that inhabit the area have been harvesting the bounty of seas since a long time ago, therefore seafood is popular and almost become a staple diet. The Sulawesi Sea and Maluku Sea, and Gulf of Tomini are teeming with marine life. The harbor cities of Manado and Bitung are the center of fishing industry in the area. Actually, the whole eastern provinces of Indonesia, from Sulawesi to Maluku archipelago, are famous for their seafood. Various seafood such as cakalang (skipjack tuna), tude (mackerel), oci (larger mackerel), tuna, albacore, bobara (trevally), kakap (red snapper), kerapu (garoupa), tenggiri (wahoo), bawal (pomfret), shrimp, mussels and crabs are available in marketplace, and often being grilled on charcoal, and served in dabu-dabu condiment; cooked in woku or rica-rica spice, or in kuah asam soup. Exotic meats Paniki, fruit bat in spicy bumbu rica-rica green chili pepper Minahasan people are also known for their bushmeats tradition. Before converting to Christianity in early 16th to 17th century, Minahasans were animists, and their practice on consuming almost every kind of animal still continued until this days. Rintek wuuk or RW (lit. Minahasan: \\"fine hair\\") is euphemism of dog meat. In Minahasan culture it is considered prestigious to consume rare and unusual meats.

The court held that as inter partes proceedings created a lis between the parties (per Lewes), equal treatment (per Al Rawi) meant that ex parte evidence in general could not be adduced. Facts Two army officers, B and D had been passing information from the COBRA committee to British Sky Broadcasting Ltd (B Sky B) in the person of Sam Kiley. The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police (the Commissioner) had made an inter partes application for a production order, to the circuit judge. Certain evidence was offered ex parte over the objections of B Sky B. The judge granted the order, and B Sky B applied to the Administrative Court for a judicial review. The Administrative Court quashed the production order ([2011] EWHC 3451 (Admin)). Proceedings against the officers were dropped, but because of the importance of the legal argument, the Commissioner appealed. Judgment In the Supreme Court, arguments were heard from the parties to the case. Lord Toulson, with whom the other members agreed, said that the general power of a magistrate to issue a search warrant on ex parte application of a police officer, given reasonable belief that an indictable offence had taken place and that there was material likely to be of substantial value to the investigation on the premises, section 14 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 mean that journalistic material was classed as \\"special procedural material\\" and did not fall under the general power. Application had been made under both the general and the \\"special material\\" sets of access conditions, and only the \\"special material\\" set was applicable. Special material, fell under section 9 and Schedule 1, and the application consequently had to be made inter partes and to a circuit judge. The issue was whether the court might have regard evidence given by the applicant but not disclosed to the respondent. The principle in Al Rawi that, as a general rule, a respondent should have access to evidence on which the case was based applied to criminal and civil trials, did not extend to applications to obtain evidence from a third party whose substantive legal rights were not involved. However, since the hearing was inter partes a discrete, substantive legal issue arose. Equal treatment meant that the crown court judge should not have taken into account the ex parte evidence. Therefore the Divisional Court was correct to quash the order, and the appeal was dismissed.

Cardus is based out of Hamilton, Ontario with offices in Calgary and Montreal as well. Its work relies upon Judeo-Christian social thought in order \\"to enrich and challenge public debate through research, events, and publications, for the common good.\\"  History  Cardus has its roots in a charity established in 1974 under the name Foundation for Research and Economics in Developing a Christian Approach to Industrial Relations and Economics, also known as the Work Research Foundation (WRF). Spearheaded by Harry Antonides and Bernard Zylstra, the work of the Work Research Foundation consisted primarily in the publication of a quarterly newsletter, Comment, and occasional conferences. In 1996, WRF received a project grant from the Donner Canadian Foundation to deal with freedom of association in Canadian labour relations. This project included a survey of Canadian attitudes towards unions done in cooperation with Gallup; the publication of Buying a Labour Monopoly, and numerous smaller publications and presentations. Ray Pennings directed this project and, together with Gideon Strauss, developed a proposal to develop the Work Research Foundation into a full-fledged think tank that would be \\"public, credible and Christian.\\" Michael Van Pelt, at that time the President of the Sarnia Chamber of commerce, was hired as the first full-time employee and began work in September 2000. Ray Pennings joined the full-time staff in 2002, having previously served as the Public Affairs Director for the Christian labour association of canada. They developed a threefold strategy of utilizing publications, research, and networking events in order to map the institutional space that exists between government and the markets. Early research projects looked at leadership in the business sector, patterns of trade between Canada and the United States, and labour mobility in Canada's construction sector. The publication of Comment magazine as an anchor magazine commenced in 2002 and regular events, many of which involved Senior Fellows recruited to the organization, were held across the country.  Research  From its guiding principles, Cardus currently works on three fronts. First, partnering with Notre Dame University, Cardus launched the Cardus Education Survey, an ongoing study of the outcomes of education in both the public and private sectors in North American secondary schools.Van Pelt, D, Pennings, R, Seel, D.J., and Sikkink, D (2012) Cardus education survey. a rising tide lifts all boats. Hamilton, Canada: Cardus, page 5. Second, Cardus is also involved in Social Cities, a project which helps promote the complex relationships of people, culture, and institutions that make up North American urban spaces. Third, Cardus is engaged with Work and Economics, constructing arguments and policy related to issues of work dignity and labour relations. In 2014, Cardus's research was used by Member of Parliament, Jason Kenney, in his remarks for a conference of Canada's New Industrial Revolution. * Education and Culture exists to provide reliable, credible data for non-government types of education.Van Pelt, D, Pennings, R, Seel, D.J., and Sikkink, D (2012) Cardus education survey. a rising tide lifts all boats.

Tuvalu's independence was granted to it by the United Kingdom by virtue of the Tuvalu Independence Order 1978 (UK). Tuvalu became an independent constitutional monarchy on 1 October 1978. Queen Elizabeth II - as the Queen of Tuvalu - is the Head of State, represented by the Governor-General, who is appointed by the Queen on advice of the Prime Minister of Tuvalu. A written constitution was adopted at independence. In 1986 Tuvalu approved a new constitution that had been developed by the community leaders and the members of the Tuvaluan parliament. In May 2018 a translation of the current Constitution into the Tuvaluan language was completed as part of the Tuvalu Constitutional Review Project. History of political institutions in Tuvalu Tuvaluans participated in the political institutions of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony during the transition to self-determination. In 1974 the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony acquired its own constitution. A referendum was held in December 1974 to determine whether the Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands should each have their own administration.Nohlen, D, Grotz, F & Hartmann, C (2001) Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume II, p831 As a consequence of the 1974 Ellice Islands self-determination referendum the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony ceased to exist on 1 January 1976 and the separate British colonies of Kiribati and Tuvalu came into existence. The Constitution adopted on independence Tuvalu became fully independent within the Commonwealth on 1 October 1978 with a written constitution. John F. Wilson, as Attorney-General, advised on the transition of Tuvalu to independence including attending the Constitutional Conference in Marlborough House in London and visiting each island of Tuvalu to explain the Constitution. Amending the Constitution and referendums in Tuvalu Section 7 provides for alterations of the Constitution generally and section 8 addresses alterations of the Constitution to give effect to constitutional changes in the United Kingdom. In 2008 Tuvaluans rejected a constitutional referendum that proposed replacing the Queen of Tuvalu, with an elected president as the Head of State. The 1986 amendments to the Constitution In 1986 the Constitution adopted upon independence was amended in order to give attention to Tuvaluan custom and tradition as well as the aspirations and values of the Tuvaluan people. The changes placed greater emphasis on Tuvaluan community values rather than Western concepts of individual entitlement. The preamble was change and an introductory ‚ÄòPrinciples of the Constitution‚Äô was added. The Tuvaluan values are reflected in the references in the preamble to Christian principles:- :AND WHEREAS the people of Tuvalu, acknowledging God as the Almighty and Everlasting Lord and giver of all good things, humbly place themselves under His good providence and seek His blessing upon themselves and their lives; :AND WHEREAS the people of Tuvalu desire to constitute themselves as an independent State based on Christian principles, the Rule of Law, and Tuvaluan custom and tradition; ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ The revision of the Constitution set out the following principles:- :Principles of the Constitution :1. The principles set out in the Preamble to the Independence Constitution are re-affirmed and re-adopted. :2. The right of the people of Tuvalu, both present and future, to a full, free and happy life, and to moral, spiritual, personal and material welfare, is affirmed as one given to them by God. :3. While believing that Tuvalu must take its rightful place amongst the community of nations in search of peace and the general welfare, nevertheless the people of Tuvalu recognize and affirm, with gratitude to God, that the stability of Tuvaluan society and the happiness and welfare of the people of Tuvalu, both present and future, depend very largely on the maintenance of Tuvaluan values, culture and tradition, including the vitality and the sense of identity of island communities and attitudes of co- operation, self-help and unity within and amongst those communities. :4. Amongst the values that the people of Tuvalu seek to maintain are their traditional forms of communities, the strength and support of the family and family discipline. :5. In government and in social affairs generally the guiding principles of Tuvalu are- :agreement, courtesy and the search for consensus, in accordance with traditional Tuvaluan procedures, rather than alien ideas of confrontation and divisiveness; :the need for mutual respect and co-operation between the different kinds of authorities concerned, including the central Government, the traditional authorities, local governments and authorities, and the religious authorities. :6. The life and the laws of Tuvalu should therefore be based on respect for human dignity, and on the acceptance of Tuvaluan values and culture, and on respect for them. :7. Nevertheless, the people of Tuvalu recognize that in a changing world, and with changing needs, these principles and values, and the manner and form of their expression (especially in legal and administrative matters), will gradually change, and the Constitution not only must recognize their fundamental importance to the life of Tuvalu but also must not unnecessarily hamper their expression and their development. :THESE PRINCIPLES, under the guidance of God, are solemnly adopted and affirmed as the basis of this Constitution, and as the guiding principles to be observed in its interpretation and application at all levels of government and organized life. The Principles make frequent reference to Tuvaluan values, culture, custom and tradition and draw attention to the importance of the Christian religion to Tuvaluan society. Tuvalu as a parliamentary democracy The role of the member of the Parliament of Tuvalu in the parliamentary democracy established in the Constitution, and the ability of a Falekaupule to direct an MP as to their conduct as a member, was considered in Nukufetau v Metia. The Falekaupule of Nukufetau directed Lotoala Metia, the elected member of parliament, as to which group of members he should join and when this directive was not followed the Falekaupule ordered Metia to resign as a member of parliament. When the Falekaupule attempted to enforce these directives through legal action, the High Court determined that the Constitution is structured around the concept of a parliamentary democracy; and that ‚Äú[o]ne of the most fundamental aspects of parliamentary democracy is that, whilst a person is elected to represent the people of the district from which he is elected, he is not bound to act in accordance with the directives of the electorate either individually or as a body. He is elected because a majority of the voters regard him as the candidate best equipped to represent them and their interests in the government of their country. He is bound by the rules of parliament and answerable to parliament for the manner in which he acts. Should he lose the confidence of the electorate, he cannot be obliged to resign and he can only be removed for one of the reasons set out in sections 96 to 99 of the Constitution.‚Äù The Chief Justice also considered the question as to whether an MP's customary obligation to obey the commands of the island as expressed by the Falekaupule, overrides the MP's duties to Parliament. The Falekaupule asserted that customary process known as falaesea (to banishment a person who defied the customary authority of the Falekaupule) provided the legal authority to order Metia to resign as a member of parliament. The Chief Justice stated that ‚Äú[i]f the fifth principle of the Preamble is to have any real meaning, it must apply to this case. The Constitution is law for the whole of Tuvalu. It clearly and properly acknowledges the customary role of, and respect for, the falekaupule on each island but, when support for an island's custom and tradition will have a disproportionate effect on the whole country, the island's interests must be subordinated to the national interest. The constitutional preservation of those traditional values is a vital part of present day Tuvalu but I cannot accept that a decision to implement them on one island is reasonable if it will seriously have an adverse effect on the whole country. In the present case, I am satisfied that it was unreasonable for the Falekaupule to ignore the interests of the whole country over an affront to its dignity by one of the island community.‚Äù The Chief Justice went on to state that ‚Äúthe carrying out of those threats by the orders banishing Metia and thus preventing him from properly performing the duties for which he was elected were clearly contrary to the spirit and intent of the Constitution and a totally unacceptable intrusion into the workings of the Tuvaluan Parliament. It should be borne in mind that the supremacy given Parliament by the Constitution is over the country as a whole and must, therefore, take precedence over purely local interests if the latter are in conflict with the national interest. I am satisfied that, as it was a challenge to parliamentary supremacy, it was unreasonable and was thus a breach of the defendant's right to procedural fairness. Similarly, the order of falaesea, although a part of the customary practices of Nukufetau, was so extremely disproportionate to the actions of the Falekaupule in similar previous cases as to be unfair.‚Äù The summoning of meetings of Parliament The summoning of meetings of Parliament is covered by section 116 (1) of the Constitution which states ‚ÄúSubject to this section, Parliament shall meet at such places in Tuvalu, and at such times, as the Head of State, acting in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet, appoints.‚Äù The question as to whether the Governor General has the power to summon Parliament without, or in disregard of the advice of Cabinet and, if so, the circumstances which could allow the use of that power was considered in Amasone v Attorney General. The Chief Justice stated that ‚ÄúIn a country whose Constitution seeks to achieve a fair and democratic government, it must be contrary to the spirit of the Constitution for a Prime Minister who knows that he has actually lost his support in the House to try and stay in power by delaying the meeting of Parliament at which the loss of confidence would be confirmed. ‚Ä¶ Whether it is unfair or undemocratic will, of course, depend on the circumstances of the case. Thus, in the present case, the Prime Minister could not be said to have flouted the aspirations of section 4 by remaining in power prior to the by-elections in May even though at that time he had clearly lost his majority but, once those elections appeared to have changed the balance of power, it would accord with the principles of fair and democratic government to allow Parliament to decide as soon as possible.‚Äù The Chief Justice then stated ‚ÄúThe electorate is entitled to expect its wishes to be reflected in the composition of government as soon as practicable after it has voted. That must apply whenever the result of any election appears to have changed the balance of power in Parliament.‚Äù The Chief Justice concluded by setting out the sequence of events for the Governor General to consider under a. 116 (1) to assist his decision what is the appropriate action to take in relation to the time of the calling of the next meeting of Parliament. The exercise of political judgment in the calling of by-elections and the summoning of parliament was again tested in 2013. Prime minister Willy Telavi delayed calling a by-election following the death of a member from Nukufetau until the opposition took legal action, which resulted in the High Court ordered the prime minister to issue a notice to hold the by-election. The 2013 Nukufetau by-election was won by the opposition candidate, which result meant that Telavi did not appear to have the support of a majority of the members of parliament. A constitutional crisis developed in mid 2013 when prime minister Willy Telavi took the position that, under the Constitution, he was only required to convene parliament once a year, and was thus under no obligation to summon it until December 2013. Tuvalu's opposition then requested the Governor-General Iakoba Italeli to intervene against the prime minister's decision. On 3 July the Governor-General exercised his reserve powers in ordering Parliament to convene. Sections of the Constitution = Bill of Rights= Part I, Section 3 of the Constitution states that it is ‚Äúthe supreme law of Tuvalu‚Äù and that ‚Äúall other laws shall be interpreted and applied subject to this Constitution‚Äù. Section 15 section 15 set out a statement as to how the question whether a law is ‚Äúreasonably justifiable in a democratic society‚Äù is to be addressed. Part II of the Constitution sets out the Principles of the Bill of Rights and the Protection of the Fundamental Rights and Freedoms; with Subdivision B of Part II setting out special exceptions to those rights and freedoms. In particular Section 29 (1) refer states that the ‚ÄúPreamble acknowledges that Tuvalu is an Independent State based on Christian principles, the Rule of Law, Tuvaluan values, culture and tradition, and respect for human dignity.‚Äù Section 29 (3) describes the way in which Tuvaluan values may circumscribe freedoms of the individual to acknowledged community values: :(3) Within Tuvalu, the freedoms of the individual can only be exercised having regard to the rights or feelings of other people, and to the effect on society. :(4) It may therefore be necessary in certain circumstances to regulate or place some restrictions on the exercise of those rights, if their exercise ‚Äî :(a) may be divisive, unsettling or offensive to the people; or :(b) may directly threaten Tuvaluan values or culture. The balancing process that is inherent in reconciling the Protection of the Fundamental Rights and Freedoms with Tuvaluan values or culture was considered in Teonea v Pule o Kaupule of Nanumaga. In that case the High Court of Tuvalu, then subsequently the Court of Appeal of Tuvalu had to determine whether the freedoms of belief (s. 23); expression (s. 24) and assembly and association (s. 25) and the freedom from discrimination (s. 27) could be restricted when the Falekaupule (the traditional assembly of elders) of Nanumaga passed a resolution that had the effect of banning the Brethren Church from seeking converts in Nanumaga. The Falekaupule were on the view that the preaching of the Brethren Church was causing division in the Nanumaga community. Subsequently legal claims were made in the High Court with each claims arising from the problems which followed the establishment of the Brethren Church on Nanumaga. Four people from Nanumaga sued in relation to unlawful dismissal from their employment on grounds that included unlawful discrimination on the basis of religion and that their Constitutional right to freedom of belief, expression and association have been denied by the Falekaupule. Three claims were dismissed, with one plaintiff being awarded general damages and aggravated damages. =The Monarchy of Tuvalu and the Governor General= The Monarchy of Tuvalu exists in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy. As a constitutional monarch, The Queen acts entirely on the advice of her Government ministers in Tuvalu. The Head of State is recognised by the Constitution, in section 50, as a symbol of the unity and identity of Tuvalu. The powers of the Head of State are set out in section 52 (1) of the Constitution. Part IV of the Constitution confirms the Head of State of Tuvalu is Queen Elizabeth II as the Sovereign of Tuvalu and provides for the rules for succession to the Crown. As set out in section 54 of the Constitution, the Queen's representative here is the Governor General. Section 58 requires the Governor General to perform the functions of the Head of State when the Sovereign is outside Tuvalu or otherwise incapacitated. The exercise of the Royal prerogative of mercy or 'Power of Mercy' to grant a pardon and the commutation of prison sentences is described in section 80 of the Constitution. The style and title of Elizabeth II, as Monarch of Tuvalu, is set out in Act 1 of 1987 of the Parliament of Tuvalu as being: Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, Queen of Tuvalu and of Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth. Under the Constitution of Tuvalu, the oath of allegiance is a declaration of allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Her Heirs and Successors. =The prime minister, cabinet and ministerial government= Part V of the Constitution establishes the executive authority of Tuvalu and confirms that while the Prime Minister is the head of government, executive power is exercised by ministerial government. Part V also establishing the role of the cabinet and the senior civil service positions of the Secretary to Government and the Attorney-General. The role of Attorney-General is carried out by a trained lawyer employed in the public service. In Tuvalu the Attorney-General sits in Parliament, but does not vote: the parliamentary role of the Attorney-General is purely advisory. =Parliament of Tuvalu= Part VI of the Constitution describes the Electoral laws, the role of the Parliament and the manner of exercise of the law-making power. The Parliament of Tuvalu or Palamene o Tuvalu is the unicameral national legislature in Tuvalu. Tuvalu follows the Westminster system of parliamentary traditions, which are modified to suit Tuvaluan political environment. The elected members of parliament selecting the Prime Minister and the Speaker of the Parliament by secret ballot. The Speaker is the presiding officer of the parliament. The Ministers that form the Cabinet are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister. The summoning of meetings of Parliament is described in section 116 and section 118 addresses the timing of general elections. =The Courts of Tuvalu= Part VII of the Constitution establishes the judicial system of Tuvalu. The High Court of Tuvalu has general jurisdiction and responsibility, as authorised by sections 120 to 133 of the Constitution. The Court of Appeal of Tuvalu is established by sections 134 & 135 of the Constitution to hear appeals from decisions of the High Court. The Constitution establishes that in respect of decisions of the Court of Appeal, there is a right of appeal to Her Majesty in Council, i.e., the Privy Council in London. =The Public Service= Part VIII of the Constitution establishes the State Services and the general functions of the Public Service Commission. The Governor-General's power to dismiss public servants at pleasure ‚Äì and the role of the Public Service Commission in the dismissal of public servants - was considered by the High Court in Toafa v Attorney-General. =Parliamentary responsibility for finance= Part IX of the Constitution establishes the office of Auditor-General and confirms parliamentary responsibility for finance and the National Budget. Section 165 (1) states ‚Äúthe raising and spending of money by the Government (including the imposition of taxation and the raising of loans) is subject to authorization and control by Parliament, and shall be regulated by an Act of Parliament.‚Äù The Tuvalu Constitutional Review Project (2016-2019) In 2016 a 3 year review of the Constitution of Tuvalu commenced. The Tuvalu Constitutional Review Project was implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Government of Tuvalu. The project reviewed executive/parliamentary relations and Tuvalu's commitments under international law. The project considered the country's socio-economic and political context, such as the sensitivities over political and religious diversity among Tuvalu's Christian and religious minorities.

She was used primarily as an ocean convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Mount Royal, Quebec, however due to possible confusion with , her name was switched around. Royal Mount was ordered on 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943‚Äì1944 River-class building program. She was laid down on 7 January 1944 as Alvington by Canadian Vickers Ltd. at Montreal and launched 15 April 1944. Her name was changed and she was commissioned as Royal Mount on 25 August 1944 at Montreal. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River- class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history Royal Mount sailed for Halifax and worked up at Bermuda in September 1944. Upon her return she was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) escort group C-1 as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort, joining up with the group in November. She remained with the group until May 1945, when she returned to Canada for the final time. Royal Mount underwent a refit from May 26 to 5 October 1945 at Sydney, Nova Scotia. She was decommissioned 17 November 1945 and placed in reserve at Bedford Basin. She remained there until her purchase in 1947 for scrap. The ship was broken up at New York City in 1948. The ship's bell lies in the entrance to the town hall of Mount Royal. The ship was commemorated during the Canadian Naval Centennial.

This coupled with the death of his paternal grandfather in 1314 led to William Devereux becoming a retainer of the Mortimer family. Rising debt related to the terms of the Dictum of Kenilworth had led the Baron Devereux to financial arrangements permitting the alienation of Lyonshall Castle, the caput of the Barony. William's cousin, Stephen Devereux of Bodenham and Burghope tried to regain Lyonshall through seizing it by force in 1305, and bringing suit for its return. Stephen's plea was denied, as he had no standing while the Baron was still alive.Charles J.

Career The Devereux family's alignment against Edward II during the killing of his first favorite, Piers Gaveston, probably contributed to their failure to retain their Barony upon the death of William Devereux's grandfather in 1314. William Devereux was granted Letters of Protection for service in Scotland under John de Somery on 20 July 1319. He probably was present at the Battle of Myton on 20 September 1219. As later the Despenser War played out, Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March was captured in January 1322, and imprisoned in the Tower of London. As William Devereux was his retainer, this was probably a factor in keeping him out of the Battle of Boroughbridge on 16 March 1322. Edward II's victory led to the death of Batholomew de Badlesmere and William Touchet, and brought Lyonshall Castle back into the King's hands.UK National Archives, Lyonshall Collection: Records of the Exchequer, and its related bodies, with those of the Office of First Fruits and Tenths, and the Court of Augmentations.

This placed William Devereux further at odds with the Devereux's of Bodenham. When Roger de Mortimer escaped to France in August 1323, William Devereux remained loyal, but found himself among those suffering royal disapproval.

But he would always find a way to make each person's research relevant to the interests of the other people at the table.\\" He chaired the psychology department at the University of Texas between 1964 and 1969. Later, the university credited him with \\"transforming the department from a relatively small and unassuming group to a large and internationally recognized faculty.\\" Lindzey made contributions to personality psychology, social psychology, the history of psychology and behavioral genetics. He moved into educational administration at Texas, becoming the vice president for academic affairs and remaining there until 1975. He then became the longest-serving director of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (CASBS), running the center between 1975 and 1989 after completing fellowships there in 1954, 1964 and 1972. In 1982, he was a key member (immediate past chair) of the NAS committee that recommended the decriminalization of marijuana in An Analysis of Marijuana Policy, a report commissioned several years earlier by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Other committee members included psychiatrist Daniel X. Freedman, former U.S. drug czar Jerome Jaffe, sociologists Denise Kandel and Howard S. Becker, psychologist and future university and foundation president Judith Rodin, future Nobel Prize winner in economics Thomas Schelling, and former CBS president Frank Stanton. The report highlighted the costs associated with the 400,000 annual marijuana-related arrests. When the report was published, NAS president Frank Press included a cover letter with it that criticized the report. Press thought that the committee had overstepped its bounds with its conclusions, which he said were better left to the political process. National Institute on Drug Abuse director William Pollin also said that it was \\"a terrible mistake and a public health tragedy\\" to advocate for societal acceptance of marijuana use. =Later life= An athlete in high school, Lindzey continued to play tennis for several years after his retirement. He was ill for the last couple of years of his life. He spent some time in hospice care, but he was able to return to work as an editor almost up to the time that he died. =Personal= Lindzey married Andrea Lewis in 1944 and they had five children. She died in 1984. In his later years, he had a companion, a psychologist named Lyn Carlsmith.

It is likely that the church was originally an open-air stone altar, with walls and a roof added later. The church had a rectangular nave with a square choir. In the 1600s, a wooden nave and steeple were added. In 1865, a new wooden church was built about southwest of the old church. The new building was consecrated on 20 September 1865 by the Bishop Peter Hersleb Graah Birkeland. Not long afterwards, the old church was torn down. Priests that served at the church included Ludvig Daae (from 1759 onward).

On 1 June 1772, the church burned down after being struck by lightning. A new church was built to replace it and the new church was consecrate exactly one year to the day after the fire. That church stood until 1892, when it was torn down to make room for the present church (the fourth church on the same site).

In the mid-1800s, it was decided to build a new church. It was the request of the villagers that the new church be built of stone from the surrounding area rather than a wood church, and it was also decided to move the location of the church. The new stone church was built about southeast of the old church site, so that it was closer to the main village area. The new church was consecrated on 17 November 1861 by the local provost Hveding.

The first church was likely a stave church and it was located about southeast of the present location of the church. This medeival building was torn down around the year 1610 and replaced by a new timber-framed building on the same location. An alternate theory is that in 1610, the old stave church was renovated and expanded in 1610, since the new building was about twice as large. The old church may have been renovated into the choir and sacristy with the addition becoming the new nave. Seim belonged to the parish of Hammer before 1749. In that year, it was separated from Hammer and transferred to Hosanger parish (as an exclave). In 1885, Seim was transferred from Hosanger to Alversund parish. In 1839, the church building was damaged in a storm. It was repaired. In the 1870s, it was decided to build a new, larger church a little closer to the village of Seim, about to the northwest. The new church was the third building to hold the name Seim church and it was completed in 1878. The new building was consecrated on 16 July 1878. Sometime after the new church was completed, the old church was torn down. In 1964, the church was transferred to the Lind√•s parish.

Heroiam slava!; translated as: Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!) is a Ukrainian national salute. It appeared at the beginning of the 20th century in different variations, when it became wildly popular among national Ukrainians during the Ukrainian War of Independence of 1917‚Äì21. History =20th century= World War II-era monument in memory of UPA freedom fighters with inscription \\"Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!\\", in place of the Janowa Dolina massacre, Bazaltove, Ukraine The phrase ‚ÄúSlava Ukraini!‚Äù (Glory to Ukraine!) first appeared in different military formations during the Ukrainian War of Independence (from 1917 to 1921).Why Is the International Media Still Repeating Kremlin Propaganda about Ukraine?, Atlantic Council (13 July 2018) \\"Glory to Ukraine!\\" - the story of the slogan of the struggle for independence, Radio Free Europe (19 June 2017) It became part of the lexicon of Ukrainian nationalists in the 1920s. The modern response \\"Heroiam slava!\\" (Glory to the heroes!) appeared in the 1930s among members of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) who started using this slogan, replacing all former responses with it as a mark of deep respect for all the men and women who had laid down their lives for their country. The partisans thus honoured the memory of all the brave soldiers and passed it on to future generations. The greeting Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes! became an official slogan of Stepan Bandera's OUN-B in April 1941.Ivan Katchanovski (2004). \\"The Politics of World War II in Contemporary Ukraine\\". The Journal of Slavic Military Studies. p. 214. ‚ÄúSlava Ukraini! Heroiam slava!\\" became very popular in the 1940s and 1950s when the OUN/UPA partisan movement fighting against the Polish and Soviet occupiers swept across most of western Ukraine. \\"Glory to the heroes!\\" was also used by the Kuban Cossacks dating back to at least 1944 with the return of the Cossack Rebel Army who fought with the UPA. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the slogan began to be heard at rallies and demonstrations. After Ukraine declared independence in 1991, the phrase \\"Glory to Ukraine\\" became a common patriotic slogan. In 1995, President of the United States Bill Clinton used the phrase in his speech in Kyiv (together with \\"God bless America\\"). =21st century= The phrase has undergone a resurgence in recent times, becoming a popular and prominent refrain during the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. In September 2014, after addressing a gathering of the United States Congress in Washington, D.C., Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko concluded his speech by uttering the phrase. It is also commonly used in greeting to Ukraine from the world leaders. On July 10, 2018, Ukrainian supporters flooded the Facebook page of football governing body FIFA with over 158,000 comments, most saying \\"Glory to Ukraine\\", after FIFA fined Croatia's assistant coach for a video in which he used the same slogan after Croatia's World Cup victory. Russia alleged that the chant has ultra-nationalist connotations, as it was popularised by World War II era groups, such as the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), who collaborated with the Nazis. The Football Federation of Ukraine said in a statement that \\"Glory to Ukraine is a commonly used greeting in Ukraine ... (and) should not be interpreted as an act of aggression or provocation\\". On 9 August 2018 Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko announced that Glory to Ukraine will be the official greeting of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, replacing Hello Comrades (–í—ñ—Ç–∞—é —Ç–æ–≤–∞—Ä–∏—à—ñ, Vitayu tovaryshi). The greeting was used during the Kyiv Independence Day Parade on 24 August 2018. The Ukrainian parliament approved the President's bill on this (in its first reading) on 6 September and on 4 October 2018.Verkhovna Rada approves military salute ‚ÄòGlory to Ukraine!‚Äô, 112 Ukraine (6 September 2018) Ukraine's parliament approves new army, police greeting, UNIAN (4 October 2018) Parliament also made Glory to Ukraine the official greeting of the National Police of Ukraine.Rada approves salute 'Glory to Ukraine' in Ukrainian army, Interfax-Ukraine (4 October 2018) On 7 September 2018, the Ukrainian national football team wore the phrase on their kits, during a UEFA Nations League match with the Czech Republic. Controversies In the Soviet Union the slogan ‚ÄúSlava Ukraini!‚Äù was forbidden and discredited via a decades long propaganda campaign alongside the Ukrainian nationalists who used it. They were dubbed \\"Nazi henchmen\\". Modern Russia followed the similar trend when the slogan was characterised as a fascist slogan, notably during the Ukrainian crisis.https://www.stalkerzone.org/vladimir-kornilov-there-is-no- difference-between-sieg-heil-and-slava-ukraini/ Beyond the border of Europe, the song Glory to Hong Kong drew inspiration from the slogan for use in the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests.https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/hong-kong- protesters-draw-inspiration-ukraines-maidan This was received extremely negatively in mainland China, with the Chinese accusing Ukraine of meddling in Hong Kong affairs under the order of the United States, and was not censored by the Great Firewall of the Chinese government.https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/81933448https://www.guancha.cn/internation/2019_12_03_527229.shtml See also *Glory to Hong Kong, which is influenced from the slogan.

His household was given responsibility for Elizabeth‚Äôs care in addition to the disposition of his goods.

They assaulted William‚Äôs men and servants, and carried away Elizabeth de Mortimer and his goods. They also lay in wait for Devereux to kill him. William being unable to go to the manse to dispose of his goods (and evidently unable to recover Elizabeth, demanded 40 shillings compensation on 3 July 1370. This event appears to have led to a longstanding grudge against the Zeddefen's that was unresolved at the time of William‚Äôs death years later as described below. This insult to Devereux honor appears to have led to a rapprochement with his cousins, William Devereux of Bodenham and John Devereux of Whitchurch Maund, which contributed to a return of royal favor. William Devereux began to have a more prominent role in Hereford. He was knighted about 1370.

First of all, I bequeath my soul to God Almighty and my body to be buried in the priory of St Leonard of Wormsley. Also I do bequeath the chapel in my manor of Frome Haymond 8 pounds sterling. Also I bequeath to William, son of Stephen Devereux,This may be referring to the William Devereux of Bodenham mentioned above who died in 1376/7 thirty shillings. Also, I bequeath to my son Thomas, thirteen shillings and four pence. Also, I ordain, assign and want my Executors to work together or separately with my sons, John and William, in pursuing the recovery of two hundred silver marks from Thomas Zeddefen that Thomas owes me; of which money I want my daughter Elizabeth to have forty marks and that my sons recovering the money I spoke of have between them the residue of the same money.

In addition to his sons, he trained Jacob Rottiers, Inghenasius Leysens (1680‚Äì81), Joseph Verhulst, Jan van Hoeck, Abraham Hynderickx (1682‚Äì83), Jacobus Rottiers (1685-86), Peter van Tienen, Pauels de Decker (1687‚Äì88), Franciscus Sions (1688-89), Franciscus Geeregroot (1692‚Äì93), Philippus Terroude (1695‚Äì96), Judocus van Schoor, Theodor Geiregroot, Hendrick van Wetteren, Jacobus Vinckenboom (1697‚Äì98), Egidius Schoenmaeckers (1699-1700); Lenaert Batalie (1700-1701) and Jan van Rehabel (1701-1702). This great number of pupils shows the respect in which he was held.

Work Funerary monument for Don Francisco Marcos de Velasco He produced mainly church sculpture and monumental tombs, in which he displayed a vivid imagination and a virtuoso execution. He also made ivory sculptures and drew many designs for other sculptors. His style is exemplary of the late Baroque in Flemish sculpture and shows the trend towards the Rococo in its pictorial and decorative effects. One of the high points of his work is the funeral monument for Count Karel Florentijn van Salm (who died at the Siege of Maastricht) in St Catherine's church in Hoogstraten (completed in 1709). This monument, topped by flags, military trophies and the family blazon, depicts the deceased in full battle regalia.

The park is named in honor of Elliott R. Corbett II, who was killed while serving in the United States Army during World War II. It includes of wilderness land with very few park facilities. Corbett State Park is administered by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department.  Geography  Corbett State Park covers of forest and meadow above the south shore of Blue Lake, east of the Cascade Range in Central Oregon.Bannan, Jan, \\"Elliott Corbett Memorial State Recreation Site\\", Oregon State Parks A Complete Recreation Guide, The Mountaineers Books, Seattle, Washington, 2002, pp. 172‚Äì174.Johnson, Daniel M., \\"Blue Lake\\" (PDF), Atlas of Oregon Lakes, Oregon State University Press, Corvallis, Oregon, 1985, p. 211. The park is just south of Highway 20, east of Santiam Pass and west of Sisters. The park‚Äôs elevation ranges from at the shore of Blue Lake to over on the slopes above the lake. Blue Lake fills a deep volcanic caldera to a depth of , making it one of the deepest lakes in Oregon. The steep caldera slopes make the lake shore in Corbett State Park very rugged. The lake's only outlet is Link Creek, a shallow stream that begins at the north end of Blue Lake, opposite from the park. Link Creek flows into Suttle Lake downstream.  History  In the 19th century, the central meadow of what is now Corbett State Park was a popular stopping place on the pioneer wagon road that crossed the Cascade Range near Santiam Pass. Pioneer travelers liked the site because it offered fresh water and good grazing for their draft animals. In the early 20th century, the meadow was also used by sheepherders who grazed their flocks in the eastern foothills of the Cascades.Newman, Doug, \\"Marking the Blue Lake Trail\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 19 November 1978, p. 22NW. The Oregon Parks and Recreation Department acquired property in 1952. The land was a gift to the people of Oregon from Henry L. Corbett and his wife, Gretchen. It honors their son, Elliott R. Corbett II, who was killed in action during World War II. Elliot Corbett was an infantryman in the United States Army, serving in the European Theatre when he was killed on 19 November 1944 at the age of 22. He is buried at the United States Military Cemetery at Margraten, Netherlands. The Corbett family‚Äôs gift of the park was made on condition that the land remain a wilderness area.\\"Survey for Expressway Approved\\", Northwest Magazine, The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 25 November 1952, p. 7.\\"Bond Interest Rates Threaten Program of Highway Department\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 26 June 1953, p. 19.

Wilderness  Corbett State Park is a day- use wilderness preserve. The park's central feature is a large open meadow surrounded by ponderosa and lodgepole pine. The park also includes riparian habitat along two seasonal drainages. While the park is relatively small, it provides habitat for a wide range of wildlife. The mixed conifer forest on the slopes above Blue Lake is home to a number of mammal species, including mule deer, black-tailed deer, black bear, badgers, bobcats, and cougars. Some of the small mammals found in the park include chipmunks, ground squirrels, shrews, and voles.\\"Metolius Preserve\\" , Deschutes Land Trust, Bend, Oregon, 22 March 2014.\\"Mammal Species of Oregon\\", Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, State of Oregon, Salem, Oregon, 22 March 2014. Among the birds found in or near the park are: *Mountain chickadees *Red-breasted nuthatches *Brown creeper *Dark-eyed juncos *Western tanagers *Chipping sparrows *Red crossbills *Golden-crowned kinglets *Ruby-crowned kinglet *and Steller's jays. The forest is also home to northern flickers, western wood-pewee, olive-sided flycatcher, Hammond's flycatcher, American dusky flycatcher, brown-headed cowbird, and pine siskin. Pileated woodpeckers and hairy woodpeckers have been abundant in the forest around the park since the 1990s when the spruce budworm infestation increased the insect population they feed on. Blue Lake and nearby Suttle Lake attract birds of prey such as red-tailed hawk, osprey and bald eagles as well as vultures. Both the osprey and eagles normally stay well into the fall to feed on brown trout and kokanee salmon that spawn in Link Creek, between Blue and Suttle lakes.\\"Suttle Lake\\", Deschutes National Forest, United States Forest Service, Department of Agriculture, Bend, Oregon, 22 March 2014.\\"Metolius Preserve Bird Checklist\\" (PDF), Deschutes Land Trust, Bend, Oregon, 22 March 2014.  Recreation  Corbett State Park offers a variety of wilderness experiences. The most common recreational activities are hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding. Park visitors can fish in Blue Lake, but access is difficult due to the steep caldera. Kokanee salmon are also found in the lake. However, the lakes shore is steep and can be hard to traverse with fishing gear. Sign pointing to Corbett State Park trailhead Because there is no road access to the park, visitors must hike into the area. From the west, the Corbett Park trail begins at a small parking area along Forest Service Road 2076, south of Highway 20. From the trailhead, visitors hike east through the Deschutes National Forest to the park‚Äôs main meadow. From the east, the park trail begins at Camp Caldera. From the camp, visitors can reach the park by hiking along the Blue Lake Crater Rim Trail that circles the lake. However, the trail along the east side of the lake is private property.. The entire loop trail around the lake is approximately . One can also hike the waterfall loop trail on the south side of the park. The trail leaves the meadow about fifty yards west of the creek. Run south to the falls and then curves north back towards the meadow and Dark Lake trail. During the winter months, Corbett State Park is a site for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. The ban on motorized vehicles applies all year, so snowmobiles are not allowed in park. Because Corbett State Park is only accessible by trail, it has relatively few visitors. There is no charge for using the park. However, park facilities are very limited. Potable water and toilets are not provided for visitors. Signage within the park is also very limited. This is designed to enhance the park's wilderness experience.

The district primarily includes parts of Cherokee County and also includes parts of Forsyth County and Fulton county.  Education and early career  Moore grew up in Cherokee County and attended Sequoyah High School. Moore graduated from Georgia Tech in 2000 with a degree in Computer Science. After graduating, he worked in the computer industry in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area. In 2013 he retired from the computer industry.http://cherokeecountygop.com/about-ccrp/cherokee- legislators/representatives/sam-moore  Georgia House of Representatives  = Special election 2014 = The sitting house district 22 representative, Calvin Hill, died from Leukemia on October 30, 2013 and a special election was called for January 7, 2014. On November 20, 2013, Sam Moore qualified to run for the state house district 22 along with 3 other candidates ‚Äì Meagan Biello, Jeff Duncan and Nate Cochran. Moore won a plurality of the special election with 38 percent of the 2,433 votes cast. Meagan Biello came in second with 24 percent of the vote. Moore defeated Biello at the runoff with 57.7 percent of the 2,632 votes cast on February 4, 2014 after running a campaign on fighting for liberty and fighting corruption in the Georgia State Government. = Tenure = Moore was sworn into the Georgia House of Representatives on February 11, 2014. By the time he was sworn in, the Legislative session was half over and \\"Crossover Day\\" on March 3, 2014 was rapidly approaching. During his short tenure as part of the 152nd Georgia General Assembly, Sam Moore authored or cosponsored 15 different bills and 3 house resolutions. Controversy On Wednesday, February 19, 2014, Moore introduced House Bill 1033 which repealed Georgia's Loitering Laws. However, by removing the Georgia loitering laws, the bill also removed restrictions on Sex Offenders from loitering near schools and playgrounds. On Friday February 21, 2014, an article was printed in the Cherokee Tribune discussing HB 1033. In that article Mr. Moore admitted to turning in a bill that made it legal for \\"registered sex offenders who aren't otherwise barred from going to schools or places children gather (so that sex offenders) could go to those places freely.\\" Representative Moore was quoted in the article as saying, \\"I am OK with that...Am I saying it's not creepy? It's definitely creepy.\\" Cherokee Sheriff Roger Garrison called the bill \\"simply insane.\\" and went on to say, \\"In my 34 years of law enforcement I have never heard of such an insane law having been introduced,\\" Garrison said Friday. \\"Sexual predators are one of this country's most violent (type of) offenders. If there's any equal it would be an out-and-out serial killer.\\" On Friday February 21, 2014, the Republican Leadership publicly denounced HB 1033. The speaker of the house, David Ralston stated \\"The Republican majority in the House chose to stand with Georgia's families and with children. That bill chooses to stand with sex offenders and pedophiles. And that's something that I can't fathom.\\" Moore defended his bill stating: \\"There's already laws on the books to handle everything that I've heard thus far as far as child molesters or whatever they're worried about attacking children, or whatever; there's already existing laws for that. This is kind of a vague blanket law that applies to everyone, so I didn't see a problem with removing it, and until I hear something specific I still don't have a problem.\\" On Monday, February 24, 2014, Sam Moore withdrew his bill and publicly apologized for his bill in what the Atlanta Journal And Constitution described as \\"an extraordinary speech delivered on the House floor.\\" Moore stated \\"In hindsight, this rookie mistake was silly. I am mature enough to admit that. At the time though, I believed that I was fulfilling a campaign promise to hit the ground running.\\" According to current Georgia Law, O.C.G.A. 16-11-36, Title 20, Section 20-2-1180: Child Protection Act,http://law.onecle.com/georgia/20/20-2-1180.html 42-1-15, State Sexual Offender Registry, 42-1-14 Sexual Offender Registry. According to 20-2-1180 Loitering upon school premises or within a school safety zone: Parents of children attending Georgia School's are not allowed to be on school property, without first checking into the front office. The law clearly defines, in Section A thru F, that the facilitators of the school are directed to demand that any unauthorized person leave school grounds.

In this connection the Board shall take account of the need for maximum utilisation of the productive resources available to the United States, the British Commonwealth, and the United Nations, the need to reduce demands on shipping to a minimum, and the essential needs of the civilian populations. * b. In close collaboration with the Combined Chiefs of Staff, assure the continuous adjustment of the combined production programme to meet changing military requirements. Jurisdiction The Board was charged by the Combined Chiefs of Staff to take all relevant production factors into account, for the maximum utilization of the productive resources available to the United States, Britain and its Commonwealth, and the United Nations at war. It was disbanded at the end of the war. The Board fought jurisdictional battles with a comparable agency, the Combined Munitions Assignment Board, which was part of the Combined Chiefs of Staff (which had its British and American branches). The American side was chaired by Roosevelt's top aide Harry Hopkins. The British usually favored the Board, while the Americans favored the Agency. Impact The need for the Combined Production and Resources Board was underscored in 1942 when it called on the War Department for details on the material requirements of the Army (including the Air Force) for the next 18 months. Each unit in the War Department had been accustomed to ordering directly from industry, giving out high priorities based on rough estimates, with no coordination or overall picture. Some 28,000 man-hours of work analyzed 17,000 items of procurement, and discovered what would be needed and when. The result was revolutionary, as haphazard methods gave way to systematic statistical results, broken down quarterly, that showed what the Army would purchase in terms of production, construction, and maintenance.R. Elberton Smith, The Army and Economic Mobilization (1959) pp 580-82 It coordinated activity with two similar combined boards, the Combined Food Board and the Combined Raw Materials Board. Political scientists who have studied the Board say that on the whole it was ineffective. The official history of the War Production Board says the CPRB \\"never realized\\" its opportunity:Bureau of Demobilization, United States. Civilian Production Administration. Industrial mobilization for war: history of the War Industrial Mobilization for War: History of the War Production Board and Predecessor Agencies: 1940-1945 (1947) p 225 :Despite early efforts, CPRB did not engage in comprehensive production planning or in the long-term strategic planning of economic resources. The American and British production programs for 1943 were not combined into a single integrated program, adjusted to the strategic requirements of the war. CPRB's isolation from the sources of decision regarding production objectives, its failure to develop an effective organization, its deference to other agencies and its tardiness in asserting its jurisdiction, the inadequacy of program planning by the agencies upon whom CPRB relied for forecasts of requirements, the delay of the Combined Chiefs of Staff in formulating strategic objectives for 1943‚Äîall these contributed to a result that saw adjustments in the American and British production programs for 1943 made by the appropriate national authorities in each case, rather than through combined machinery.

The migrants were among the original founders of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod. History = Background = During the middle of the 19th century Confessional Lutheran doctrines like justification by faith were under threat by rationalism. This, together with \\"unionism\\" or the merging of various Protestant groups together, drove many German Lutherans to emigrate. In 1817, Frederick William III of Prussia forced the merging of the country's largest Protestant churches (Lutheran and Reformed) into one single and united Prussian Union of churches. This subsequently led to the persecution and suppression of the confessional beliefs of orthodox Lutherans. The Evangelical Church of the Prussian Union and the merging of Lutheran and Reformed congregations into a single Church became a model for other German kingdoms. In the Kingdom of Saxony, the State Church ‚Äì a Lutheran church ‚Äì was organized as a department of the state with the secular high courts holding authority over ecclesiastical matters. As a result of \\"Unionism\\", Lutheran teachings and practices began to be altered by the state. Many Lutheran congregations resisted this forced union by worshipping in secret and many even went so far as crossing into neighboring German states to have their children baptized or to receive communion from an orthodox pastor. While persecution of Confessional Lutherans in Prussia was much more severe with police disrupting their congregational meeting places and imprisoning pastors, Confessional Lutherans in Saxony still faced oppressive restrictions. A confessional Lutheran pastor, Martin Stephan, who originally hailed from Moravia, grew more and more opposed to the new teaching and practices. Stephan eventually developed a plan to emigrate. Stephan's influence and support grew steadily. An important source for his followers was the theological school of University of Leipzig. Several theological students and six pastors turned to Stephan for spiritual leadership. For those following him, the increasing conflict with rationalism and forced unionism of the Lutheran church with the Reformed church made Stephan the champion of Lutheran orthodoxy in the eyes of those following him. In order to practice their faith freely according to the Book of Concord, Stephan, in 1830, prepared to emigrate to North America. Stephan contacted friends in Baltimore, Maryland, for possible sites of settlement. A final decision to leave the homeland was not made until the spring of 1836, when the first planning meeting took place. =Preparation for immigration= Stephan grew increasingly impatient with the development of the state church, and he was subsequently arrested at various times in Saxony for holding secret conventicles and was accused of immoral conduct. The controversies and the state's intrusion caused the lay followers of Stephan to outline their \\"Codes for Emigration\\". The planning for emigrating intensified in December 1837. The preliminary plan was organized mainly by Pastor Stephan; his attorney, Adolph Marbach; the secretary, Gustav Jaeckel; H. F. Fischer, a merchant in Dresden who was also Stephan's right-hand man; and Dr. Carl Vehse, the curator of the Saxon State Archive. Financial arrangements were worked out, the planning committee adopted a list of conditions that formed the basis for permission to emigrate, and an \\"Auswanderungs-Gesellschaft\\" (emigration society) was formed. =Voyage to New Orleans and St. Louis= The Johann Georg The Olbers By September 4, 1838, 707 people had enrolled their names to emigrate with the Auswanderungs Gesellschaft. They came from Dresden, Leipzig, Niederfrohna in the Mulde River valley, and from Kahla in the Duchy of Altenburg. A common treasury was established, a fund amounting to 125,000 Thalers. Martin Stephan was 61 years old at the time. Next to him in age were Pastors G. H. Loeber, 41, E. G. W. Keyl about 32, and Carl Ferdinand Wilhelm Walther, 27. Five sailing vessels were chartered and sailed out of Bremen with the members of the group. These ships were named Copernicus, Johann Georg, Republik, Olbers, and Amalia, the last and smallest, which was lost at sea and never heard of again. The group on the remaining four ships, totaling 602 people, arrived in New Orleans in January 1839, and from there arranged for transport on steamboat up the Mississippi River to St. Louis, Missouri. During that time, the members of the group were asked to sign a document of absolute submission to \\"our bishop Stephan\\". =Settlement of Perry County = The group reached St. Louis and spent only six weeks in that city before departing for their permanent home some south in Perry County, Missouri. However, 120 members decided to remain in St. Louis. The main body of the immigrants passed up better land near St. Louis in favor of the location in Perry County where the hilly topography was reminiscent of their homeland. The Perry County settlers suffered from poverty and their situation was only made worse by financial mismanagement and poorly ordered priorities. More than half of the colonists were forced to camp in tents, booths, or crude cabins. Their belongings, exposed to the weather, spoiled. They were plagued by malaria and scarcity of food. They survived mainly on rice and bacon. These first years were extremely difficult for the colony, as the men were mostly students and professional men unaccustomed to farming and disease. Despite the hardship and tribulations, the Saxons managed to establish seven small settlements which they named after the communities that they had left behind in Germany, among them Altenburg, Dresden, Frohna, Johannisberg, Paitzdorf, Seelitz, and Wittenberg. They also founded an educational system. A one-room Log Cabin College, Concordia, was erected in 1839 under the leadership of Walther. Classes in 1839 included six languages, math, physics, history, geography, philosophy, religion, music, and drawing. =Ousting of Stephan= In addition to enduring the physical and economic circumstances, the colony's situation was further complicated by the spiritual chaos brought on by the rejection of Stephan. Stephan's craving for power and his extreme hierarchical views had caused him to miscalculate how far he could go before reaching the breaking point. With his voluptuous living and dictatorial conduct, Stephan not only became brusque and capricious in his handling of people, but he was also accused of sexual misconduct and of mismanaging group funds to satisfy his expensive tastes. At first C.F.W. Walther kept his knowledge of Stephan's sin secret and only talked about it with some of the other clergy. He attempted to let an unordained ministerial candidate in on the secret by talking in Latin and at night. However, unbeknownst to both of them, a physician who they thought had been sleeping was awake and listening from his bed of straw nearby in the room. Although Walther expected that the other men nearby did not know Latin, he was mistaken. The doctor overheard his conversation and understood it. He told others, and soon many people in the colony knew. When confronted, Walther then talked publicly about Stephan's disgrace. On May 31, 1839, the colony gathered in Perry County and voted to depose Stephan. He was placed in a boat the next day and rowed across the Mississippi River to Illinois and permanent exile. =Uncertainty and renewed purpose= C. F. W. Walther Stephan's exile left a vacuum which no one was able to come forward and fill. A collective sense of guilt descended on the colony concerning the justifiability of the migration, the correctness or error in Stephanism, the nature of the church and ministry. The pastors became despondent, wondering whether they were a church or a mob or even if they were still Christians. It was suggested by some that a public confession of sin be made followed by a return of the entire group to Germany. In late March, as the colony drifted towards disintegration, Walther emerged with a series of propositions that were to prove fundamental in saving the colonies. On April 15 and 21, 1841, a public debate between F. A. Marbach and Walther in Altenburg was a turning point in the development of the colony. Marbach argued that the entire church polity rested on an indefinite, unclear, and insecure foundation. He doubted that their local congregation was a true Christian church or that their ministry served the will of God. Walther replied that in spite of lingering Stephanistic errors the word of God was present. There were still Christians among them, so the church was represented in their midst. It was Walther who stepped forth to guide and direct the successful establishment of colony. The colony voted in favor of Walter's vision and remained in Perry County.  Descendants  Descendants of the immigrants continue to live in Perry County, although many have moved to larger cities for employment. In 2014, 247 residents of the county continued to speak a distinct Saxon dialect of German, although that number is decreasing, with the youngest speakers being over 50 years of age.

Combined Food Board machinery had therefore been set up to prevent competitive buying of foodstuffs in short supply and remove any grievance that one country was going short while there was a surplus elsewhere.\\"Keesing's Contemporary Archives, Volume IV-V, Page 5805 The biggest problem was in limited shipping space in convoys bringing foods from the Western Hemisphere, especially with the heavy demands on shipping imposed by the landings in North Africa in November, 1942. There was barely enough space for bringing in even grain for current needs. Lord Woolton, the Minister of Food, urgently called on Britons to eat more potatoes and less bread.Keesing's Contemporary Archives, Volume IV-V, Page 5805 He introduced the National Loaf that used much less shipping space, but which consumers could barely stomach.Angus Calder, The People's War: Britain 1939-45 (1969) pp 276-77 See also * Combined Production and Resources Board * Minister of Food (United Kingdom) * Rationing in the United Kingdom * Notes Further reading * Hall, H.

In 1847 the nobility from number of Southwestern (Ukrainian) Russian guberniyas (Kyiv, Volyn, Podolie, Kherson and Tavrida) collected 200,000 rubles on construction of the school building for children of nobles from the mentioned guberniyas. The nobles also agreed to pay annually 67,000 silver rubles to the school for education. And it was petitioned to name the school after the newly born Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia. The Russian emperor Nicholas I of Russia satisfied all those petitions and the very same year visited Kyiv to pick a spot for the new school, while in the meantime it was agreed to temporarily conduct all classes in the First Kyiv Gymnasium (today the \\"Yellow Building\\" of Kyiv University). The construction was entrusted to the Russian architect Ivan Shtrom and stretched for some 10 years. The building was finally completed on August 30, 1857. It housed some 400 students. The school was changing hands during the Ukrainian‚ÄìSoviet War in 1917-20 and normal education was interrupted. From June 1920 and before the World War II the building was housing the 5th Kyiv Infantry School. During the occupation of Kyiv by the Nazi Germany, the building served as army barracks for the German Wehrmacht. On November 5, 1943 the Soviet air strike destroyed half of the building and it was rebuilt in 1951‚Äì53. Since that time here was located the headquarters of the Kyiv Military District. Since 1991 the building houses the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine. External links * Vladimir Kiev Cadet Corps. * Vladimir Kiev Cadet Corps. Cadet Commonwealth.

These highways were constructed, maintained, or funded by the Maryland State Roads Commission or Maryland State Highway Administration and assigned a unique or temporally unique number. Some time after the highway was assigned, the highway was transferred to county or municipal maintenance and the number designation was removed from the particular stretch of road. In some cases, a highway was renumbered in whole or in part. This list contains all or most of the state-numbered highways between 200 and 399 that have existed since highways were first numbered in 1927 but are no longer part of the state highway system or are state highways of a different number. Most former state highways have not had their numbers reused. However, many state highway numbers were used for a former highway and are currently in use. Some numbers have been used three times. The former highways below whose numbers are used presently, those that were taken over in whole or in part by another highway, or have enough information to warrant a separate article contain links to those separate highway articles. Highway numbers that have two or more former uses are differentiated below by year ranges. This list does not include former Interstate or U.S. Highways, which are linked from their respective lists.  MD 200 Maryland Route 200 was the designation for Larchmont Avenue from MD 4 (now Marlboro Pike) in Coral Hills north to MD 214 (now MD 332) in Capitol Heights in central Prince George's County.

The next section of MD 232 was built as part of MD 233; the gravel road improvement of Dr. Samuel Mudd Road north of Bryantown was completed in 1928. That same year, another section of gravel road that was started in 1926 was constructed from MD 6 at Dentsville south along Trinity Church Road to Ryceville about midway between Dentsville and Bryantown. Reconstruction of Olivers Shop Road and Trinity Church Road were completed in 1929 and 1930, respectively. Bryantown Road was gravelled from MD 5 toward Dr. Samuel Mudd Road in three sections that were completed in 1933, 1935, and 1936. When MD 233 was removed from the state highway system in 1956, MD 232 was extended north along Dr. Samuel Mudd Road to MD 382, which was assigned to another section of MD 233 west to Waldorf.

Starting in 1943, Cedar Point Naval Air Station (now Naval Air Station Patuxent River) was constructed on the Cedar Point peninsula. MD 248 was removed from the state highway system as all of the highway was within the area taken by the federal government for the military base. MD 250 Maryland Route 250 was the designation for Medleys Neck Road and Blakes Creek Road from west of Valley Lee to MD 249 at Valley Lee in southern St. Mary's County.

MD 257 Maryland Route 257 was the designation of the highway from MD 256 west to MD 2. The first segment of MD 257 was constructed as a 15-foot (4.6 m) wide gravel road from MD 2 east to the hamlet of Nutwell west of Deale, near the intersection with Franklin Gibson Road in 1923. MD 257 extended east to MD 256 by 1933. MD 257 became part of an extended MD 256 by 1957. MD 266 Maryland Route 266 was the designation for Sollers Wharf Road, which ran from Sollers at the mouth of St. Leonard Creek east to MD 2 (now MD 765) in Lusby in southern Calvert County.

MD 268 Maryland Route 268 was the designation for the Port Deposit Road, which ran from US 40 (now MD 7) in Perryville north to US 1 at Conowingo in western Cecil County. The first stretch of the highway to be improved was in Perryville, where Cecil County constructed with state aid a macadam road from the Aikin station on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad south toward the Post Road by 1910. Cecil County extended the macadam road to the Post Road by 1919. The highway from the Aikin railroad crossing to Port Deposit was paved as a concrete road in two sections: from the railroad to near Port Deposit by 1921 and through Port Deposit by 1923. MD 268 was paved as a concrete road from Port Deposit to US 1 at Conowingo Dam between 1930 and 1933; the construction work included repurposing a railroad bridge across Octoraro Creek as a highway bridge. MD 268's bridge across the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad was constructed between 1931 and 1934. The old highway approaching the Aikin grade crossing became MD 449. MD 268 was replaced by a southern extension of US 222 (now MD 222) in 1938. =References= MD 269 Maryland Route 269 was the designation for Liberty Grove Road, which ran from US 222 (now MD 222) in Port Deposit north through Liberty Grove and east to Harrisville Road (former MD 813A) near Colora. The first section of what became MD 269 to be constructed was from Harrisville Road to Hopewell Road, which was constructed as a macadam road by Cecil County with state aid by 1910. The highway from Port Deposit to Liberty Grove was constructed starting in 1916 and was mostly complete by 1920. The concrete road featured a gap near Dr. Jack Road; that gap was filled by a macadam road by 1927. The remainder of the highway from Liberty Grove through Colora to Harrisville Road was under construction in 1930 and completed by 1933. The portion of MD 269 between Harrisville Road and Hopewell Road was transferred from state to county maintenance through a May 8, 1958, road transfer agreement. In that same agreement, MD 276 was moved from Hopewell Road to Harrisville Road, which was then known as Kelly Road, so MD 269's eastern terminus remained at MD 276. Harrisville Road later became MD 813A after MD 276's present course was completed north of Liberty Grove Road in 1964. MD 813A was transferred from state to county control in a December 27, 1979, road transfer agreement. Thus, MD 269's eastern terminus was at a county highway until the highway from Port Deposit to Harrisville Road was transferred from state to county maintenance when the road transfer agreement of May 16, 1984, was executed the following month. =References= MD 271 Maryland Route 271 was the designation for the state-maintained portion of Susquehanna Avenue that ran from MD 7 to north of Locust Street within Perryville in western Cecil County. The street was paved as a macadam road between 1928 and 1930. MD 271 was transferred from state to town maintenance after the completion of MD 327 on the east side of Perryville in 1968; the transfer was effected through a March 8, 1967, agreement between the town and the Maryland State Roads Commission. =References= MD 275 Maryland Route 275 was the designation for the road from MD 213 west via Old Bridge Rd. This was cancelled in 1946. MD 278 Maryland Route 278 was the designation for Mechanicsville Road, which ran from the Delaware state line west and north to the Pennsylvania state line in far northeastern Cecil County. The highway was constructed as a concrete road in 1925 as Maryland's very short portion of the highway between Newark and the Lincoln Highway near Lancaster. MD 278's designation was changed to MD 896 between 1940 and 1946. The Delaware and Pennsylvania connecting highways had been numbered Delaware Route 896 and Pennsylvania Route 896, respectively, by 1938. =References= MD 280 Maryland Route 280 was the designation for Bridge Street, Singerly Road, and Lewisville Road from US 40 and US 213 in Elkton north to the Pennsylvania state line near Fair Hill in eastern Cecil County. In 1927, US 40 was assigned to Main Street, US 213 was assigned to Bridge Street south of US 40 in Elkton, and MD 280 was assigned to the highway north of US 40. When US 40 was moved to the four-lane divided Pulaski Highway in 1941, US 213's northern terminus was retracted from Main Street to the new US 40 and MD 280 was extended south from Main Street to that same intersection. When the American Association of State Highway Officials approved removing the US 213 designation from Wye Mills to Elkton at their December 1971 annual meeting, both the U.S. Highway and MD 280 were replaced by MD 213. The highways from Elkton to Fair Hill and from Elkton toward Chesapeake City were included in the original state road system designed by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. The portion of the highway from the north town limit of Elkton to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision) crossing at Singerly was constructed as a macadam road in 1911. The highway from the south town limit of Elkton at Big Elk Creek toward Chesapeake City was started in 1911 and completed as a macadam road in 1914. Bridge Street in the town of Elkton was paved as a concrete road in 1920 and 1921. By 1923, of concrete road was added north from Singerly. The remainder of the highway to Fair Hill was completed as a concrete road in 1923 and 1924. In 1924 and 1925, Bridge Street in Elkton was reconstructed. The highway from Fair Hill to the Pennsylvania state line was constructed as a concrete road between 1930 and 1933. MD 280 received two railroad grade separations in the 1930s. The route's bridge across the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak's Northeast Corridor) in Elkton was constructed between 1930 and 1934. The highway's bridge across the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad at Singerly was constructed between 1937 and 1939. MD 280 was reconstructed from Elkton to Fair Hill between 1956 and 1958. The highway was relocated north of Singerly; the bypassed section, Cherry Hill Road, became MD 812. =References= MD 283 Maryland Route 283 was the designation for Crystal Beach Road, which ran from Crystal Beach east to MD 282 in Earleville in southern Cecil County. The first segment of the highway was completed through Earleville in 1928. MD 283 was extended west to Crystal Beach as a concrete road in two segments. The first segment was started in 1930 and completed by 1933, and the second segment was completed in 1934. The highway was fully incorporated into MD 282 after the portion of MD 282 on Grove Neck Road west of Earleville was transferred to county maintenance through a May 8, 1958, road transfer agreement. =References= MD 293 Maryland Route 293 was the designation for Ericsson Avenue, which ran from Howell Point Road north to MD 292 (Main Street) within the town of Betterton in northern Kent County. The highway was built as a concrete road in 1930. MD 293 was one of several highways constructed by the Maryland State Roads Commission as or concrete roads through a $900,000 Kent County bond issue in 1929 and 1930. MD 293 and its auxiliary routes were resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1976 and were transferred from state to county maintenance through a December 1, 1987, road transfer agreement. MD 293 had three auxiliary routes. All three of these highways were also constructed in 1930 and became county maintained in 1988. They each started with different route numbers; however, all three highways became auxiliary routes of MD 293 between 1946 and 1952, likely in 1948. *MD 293A was the designation for First Avenue, which ran east from MD 292 to the end of state maintenance. MD 293A was previously MD 296. *MD 293B was the designation for School Street (now Howell Point Road), which ran from MD 293 east to MD 292.

The highway was one of the original state roads designated for improvement by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. The Easton-Trappe Road followed present-day MD 565 north from Trappe. North from Peach Blossom Creek, the old highway is overlaid by US 50 and MD 322. The old alignment of MD 331 reappears as Washington Street in Easton, ending at Dover Street, where US 213 turned north onto Washington Street. MD 331 was paved from Easton in 1915 and reached Trappe by 1919. The state highway was extended south to Cambridge when the first Choptank River Bridge opened in December 1935. On the Cambridge side of the bridge, a dual highway was constructed south to MD 16.

The highway was extended south to Rowlandsville on a concrete road constructed between 1922 and 1924. US 1 originally met the highway at its northern terminus at Oakwood. However, in 1928, after US 1 was relocated to cross Conowingo Dam, MD 338's northern terminus was moved to intersection of US 1 and US 222, the latter of which replaced MD 338 on the highway from US 1 to Oakwood. MD 338 was transferred from state to county maintenance in a December 27, 1979, road transfer agreement. =References= MD 339 Maryland Route 339 was the designation for Sligo Avenue from US 29 east to MD 320 within Silver Spring in southeastern Montgomery County. The highway was constructed by 1927 as part of MD 320. After MD 320 was placed on its present course from Washington to MD 650 in Adelphi in 1955, MD 339 was placed on the former piece of MD 320. MD 339 was removed from the state highway system by 1999 as part of the highway swap to designate the Great Seneca Highway as MD 119. MD 339 (1927) Maryland Route 339 was the designation for a 0.4 mile loop off of MD 331 (former US 213) along Osborne Road in Rhodesdale. It shows up in a 1953 Maryland SRC map.

MD 344 Maryland Route 344 was the designation for the Vienna-Mount Holly road, which ran from MD 16 at Mount Holly east to US 213 in Vienna in central Dorchester County. The highway was constructed as a macadam road from Mount Holly to Vienna by 1927. The highway's eastern terminus became US 213 when the U.S. Highway was relocated through Vienna instead of via Sharptown after the highway's bridge across the Nanticoke River opened in 1931. MD 344 was replaced by US 213 in 1939 when the U.S. Highway was rerouted via Cambridge between Vienna and Easton instead of via Hurlock and Preston. US 213 was itself replaced by US 50 in 1949. MD 345 Maryland Route 345 was the designation for Table Rock Road from US 50 near Redhouse south approximately along Backbone Mountain. The highway was constructed in 1940.

MD 351 (1927-1956) Maryland Route 351 was the designation of Meadowbridge Road and Main Street from Little Brown Road north to MD 663 (now Camden Avenue) in Fruitland in southern Wicomico County. The highway was constructed by Wicomico County with state aid as a shell macadam road from just north of Little Brown Road to the south town limit of Fruitland by 1911. The state-aided road was extended to Backbone Road, an intersection that lies on the Wicomico-Somerset-Worcester county tripoint, by 1921. By 1923, the portion of the highway north of Little Brown Road was brought into the state highway system. In addition, a section of concrete road was constructed along Main Street in Fruitland to connect the highway with Camden Avenue, which became part of US 13 (now US 13 Business) in 1927. MD 351 was removed from the state highway system in 1956. MD 351 (1987-2014) A sign for MD 351 remained along Ballenger Creek Pike between US 15/US 340 and I-70 in 2016 Maryland Route 351 was the designation for the portion of Ballenger Creek Pike from the beginning of state maintenance near Tuscarora Creek in Adamstown, which was north of the named road's southern terminus in Point of Rocks, north to MD 180 and I-70 in Frederick. The highway followed what was originally the Frederick and Ballinger Creek Turnpike from Ballenger Creek north to the Frederick and Jefferson Turnpike, which was succeeded by US 340 and later MD 180. A concrete road was built along the path of the turnpike from Ballenger Creek to south of Elmer Derr Road in 1926 and 1927. The concrete road was extended south to Renn Road in 1928 and to MD 351's present southern terminus near Adamstown in 1929 and 1930. The paved section of what became MD 78 was connected to US 340 by a county highway until the county highway was brought into the state system in 1938. MD 78's northern terminus was relocated when US 340 was reconstructed as a freeway in 1968. MD 78 and MD 180 then had concurrent termini at the two highways' interchange with US 340. In 1970, MD 180 was extended south along Ballenger Creek Pike to what had been MD 78's southern terminus near Adamstown, resulting in a cane- shaped route. In 1987, to alleviate confusion in the rapidly growing Ballenger Creek area, the Maryland State Highway Administration decided to redesignate as MD 351 the portion of MD 180 from Adamstown to Solarex Court at the southern end of its interchange with US 340 and US 15. The ramp from MD 351 to eastbound I-70 was added around 1997. MD 351 was removed from the state highway system in 2002. MD 180's eastern terminus was moved to its present location and the remainder of state-maintained Ballenger Creek Pike was transferred to Frederick County. The state highway was transferred to the county after the completion of a Maryland State Highway Administration contract to eliminate a sharp curve in the highway between Lambert Drive and Corporate Drive and construct a new bridge over Ballenger Creek. Portions of the old road were reused on the campus of newly constructed Tuscarora High School. In 2003, much of MD 351 was brought back into the state highway system; however, the Lambert Drive-Corporate Drive section remained under Frederick County maintenance. The remainder of MD 351 was transferred to Frederick County in 2014. =References= MD 355 It is unknown where this road is, but it existed per a 1937 Maryland SRC report. MD 356 Maryland Route 356 was the designation for Kingston Lane from MD 413 east to MD 667 (now Old Westover Marion Road) in Kingston in southern Somerset County.

MD 395 Maryland Route 395 was the designation for Naves Cross Road from US 220 (now MD 807) east to U.S. Route 40 in Maryland (now MD 144) near Cumberland. The highway was paved as a macadam road by Allegany County with state aid in 1911. MD 395's eastern end was adjusted when US 40 was reconstructed as the eastern end of the Cumberland Thruway (now I-68) in 1972. In 1983, US 220 was removed from the streets of Cumberland and instead used the Cumberland Thruway through the city; the U.S. Highway replaced MD 395 from the eastern end of the freeway west to MD 807, where the highway turned north onto Bedford Road toward Bedford, Pennsylvania.

As a college student, he spearheaded the restoration of Grant's Tomb in New York City's Riverside Park, and wrote a reassessment of Ulysses S. Grant's presidency. Scaturro is a constitutional law expert and served as Counsel for the Constitution on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee from 2005 to 2009, and helped coordinate the nomination process to elevate John Roberts and Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court. Scaturro published other books and articles about history, constitutional law, and public policy. He ran for Congress in 2010, 2012 and 2014 in New York's 4th congressional district on Long Island, but was defeated each time. Childhood Scaturro was born in New York City in 1972. His family moved to New Hyde Park in Nassau County on Long Island the following year. His father, Salvatore, emigrated from Italy as a boy and was self-employed in a small business fixing air conditioning and refrigeration systems. His mother, Rosanne, worked near home as a legal secretary. Scaturro attended Notre Dame Elementary School in New Hyde Park and graduated with the school's highest honor. He then attended Chaminade High School in Mineola where he graduated near the top of his class. He was active in scouting and attained the rank of Eagle Scout. Education Scaturro attended Columbia University and graduated Phi Beta Kappa, magna cum laude, in 1994 with an A.B. in history and political science. He won Columbia's Albert Marion Elsberg Prize for achievement in modern history. He then attended University of Pennsylvania Law School, receiving his J.D. in 1997, winning the Fred G. Leebron Memorial Prize for the top paper in constitutional law. He was articles editor for the Journal of International Economic Law.  Legal career  Scaturro worked several years at two large commercial law firms headquartered in New York City, Lane & Mittendorf LLP (now Windels Marx Lane & Mittendorf LLP) and later, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP. In 2005, he became Counsel for the Constitution on the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee assisting the Committee Chairman, Sen. Arlen Specter (R- PA), Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL, Ranking Member), and other Republican members of the committee. Scaturro's work focused on constitutional aspects of legislation and judicial and executive nominations. Among these, he assisted committee Republicans on the nominations of John Roberts, Samuel Alito, and Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court, and Michael Mukasey and Eric Holder to become U.S. Attorney General. In 2010, Scaturro returned home to Long Island and became a visiting Assistant Professor at Hofstra Law School, where he taught courses on the legislative process and constitutional law. He is currently a partner at FisherBroyles LLP, where he handles civil rights and commercial litigation.  Publications  Scaturro published several books and articles about history and law, including President Grant Reconsidered (1998) which triggered a broad scholarly reassessment the Grant presidency; The Supreme Court's Retreat from Reconstruction (2000), an exploration of a key chapter in the history of civil rights; Public Companies (2002), a book he co- authored about making public companies responsible following recent corporate scandals; and Never Give In: Battling Cancer in the Senate (2010), which documented Sen. Arlen Specter's cancer treatment while he was still in office. Scaturro is currently working on a book about the Alabama Claims dispute between the United States and Great Britain following the Civil War, and how the ensuing arbitration inspired international peacekeeping efforts in future generations.  Saving Grant's Tomb  Civil War general and 18th U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant died in 1885 and was interred in New York City's Riverside Park. Grant's Tomb is the largest mausoleum in the Western Hemisphere and was once among the nation's most widely visited tourist attractions. By the 1990s, however, the site had fallen into a severe state of disrepair. The tomb was scarred by graffiti. The roof leaked, the granite was cracked, and the area was used by the homeless as a latrine and drug haven. Scaturro regarded the desecration of Grant's Tomb as a national disgrace. The tomb was administered by the National Park Service, part of the U.S. Department of the Interior. Scaturro volunteered with the Park Service to conduct guided tours at the site while he was a Columbia University undergraduate. He alerted Park Service officials that the tomb urgently needed repair, but to no avail. Scaturro persisted with regular memoranda to Park Service bureaucrats, including a 26-page report submitted in the summer of 1992. For over two years, Park Service officials simply ignored him. Undeterred, Scaturro went public with a 325-page whistleblowing report he sent to Congress and the President. His efforts drew national media attention, including a 1994 New York Times editorial entitled \\"Dishonor for a Hero President\\" which said, \\"the tomb's lamentable condition demands more funds from Washington.\\" Scaturro also sued the Interior Department and National Park Service in federal court to force it to fulfill its legal duties to the public. His efforts paid off. Congress tripled the site's operations budget, including funds for security during off hours when the site was closed, and appropriated $1.8 million for a full restoration.\\"On To Gettysburg, Mr. Scaturro\\". The Hartford Courant, http://articles.courant.com/1997-05-26/news/9705250035_1_grant-s-tomb-frank- scaturro-ulysses-grant. Retrieved 21 January 2014. Scaturro explained to reporters, \\"I only did what I did because I had no other resort ... the only thing left was abandoning the site, and that was not an alternative to me.\\" Restoration was completed by April 27, 1997, the 100th anniversary of the site's dedication and Grant's 175th birthday. It was re-dedicated that day. Grant's descendants, appalled by the prior condition of the tomb, hailed Scaturro as a hero. Campaigns for United States Congress =2010= In 2010, Scaturro made his first bid for the Republican nomination to represent New York's 4th congressional district in Nassau County. After Scaturro gained momentum to defeat the Democratic incumbent, Carolyn McCarthy, the chairman of Nassau County's notorious Republican machine, Joseph Mondello, hand-picked a machine stalwart, Nassau County legislator, Francis Becker, to defeat Scaturro. Nationally syndicated columnist Michael Barone opined that Mondello preferred to \\"boot an election in order to maintain his own personal power.\\"Michael Barone, Boss Politics on Long Island, Washington Examiner, 8/19/2010, http://washingtonexaminer.com/long-island-gop-machine-looking-to- boot-another-race/article/2500382 In a three-way primary, Becker won with 11,194 votes to Scaturro's 8,241 to Dan Maloney's 3,192. McCarthy beat Becker in the general election 94,483 votes to 81,718. =2012= In 2012, Scaturro and Becker had a rematch that focused media attention on the GOP machine which intimidated county and town workers fearful of losing patronage jobs if they openly backed Scaturro over Mondello's pick, Becker. After Scaturro surged ahead in the primary campaign, the machine circulated literature labeling Scaturro, a lifelong Republican, as a Democrat. Former Republican Congressman John LeBoutillier called it \\"the most dishonest piece of political propaganda I have ever seen\\" and called the machine's behavior \\"the grossest display of political thuggery I have seen in recent American history.\\"John LeBoutillier, Newsmax, End the Political Thuggery in Nassau County: Vote Scaturro, 6/19/2012, http://www.newsmax.com/JohnLeBoutillier/NY-congressional-primary- Scaturro/2012/06/19/id/442848 A federal court unexpectedly ordered the primary for Congress take place on June 26, yielding a very low turnout. With only 7% of registered Republicans voting, Becker narrowly won the primary with 6,836 votes to Scaturro's 5,531. Nonetheless, Scaturro won the Conservative Party primary by a write-in vote‚Äîa first in the modern history of New York State for an electoral district that size. In the general election, Scaturro won 15,603 votes on the Conservative line, despite the absence of a get-out-the-vote drive, the effects of Hurricane Sandy, and a national Democratic wave. Scaturro's success on a minor party line was greater than that of any congressional candidate in the 4th District since 1986. He also received over 40% more votes within the district on the Conservative Party line than Republican-Conservative presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, and U.S. Senate candidate, Wendy Long. =2014= On October 21, 2013, Scaturro announced he would run again to challenge Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy to represent New York's 4th Congressional District. News media reported McCarthy, a nurse and lifelong smoker, was suffering from lung cancer, and on January 8, 2014, she announced that she would not seek reelection. Democrats then announced their bid to win this open \\"purple\\" seat. Syndicated columnist Michael Barone wrote that Scaturro \\"has a serious chance to win the Republican as well as Conservative nomination this year... [in what] could be a much more seriously contested seat than it was [in 2012].\\" Newsmax chief political columnist, John Gizzi, wrote that Scaturro is \\"the early favorite to win the Republican nomination.\\" On January 29, 2014, Democrat and Nassau County District Attorney, Kathleen Rice, announced she would run for the 4th District seat. It was reported she would face a primary contest from Nassau County legislator Kevan Abrahams.\\"Nassau: Abrahams, others launch fundraising efforts for 4th CD,\\" http://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/spin-cycle-1.812042/nassau- abrahams-others-launch-fundraising-efforts-for-4th-cd-1.6832213 Rice was endorsed by nine-term incumbent McCarthy. As of the January 31, 2014, FEC filing deadline, Scaturro was the only Republican candidate to have raised money, with over $113,000 cash on hand. The Nassau County Republican Committee and the Conservative Party both nominated Bruce Blakeman to face Rice but Scaturro primaried Blakeman and lost badly. Blakeman beat Scaturro in every town and won by over 30 points.

After a boyhood passed at Gibraltar, Malta, and the Cape, where his father was stationed, he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh in 1841. After graduation he completed his medical studies in Paris. Becoming an army surgeon, Nicholson spent some years in South Africa, and saw service in the Xhosa Wars in 1853 and 1854.

P. Jackson; 27 September 1843 ‚Äì 13 October 1906) was an English mountain climber. Climbing mostly in the Alps, she was described by Elizabeth Hawkins-Whitshed as \\"one of the greatest women climbers of her time\\". Early life Margaret Jackson was born in 1843 to Jane and George Samuel Sanderson. In 1865, she married Edward Patten (E. P.) Jackson, the owner of a coal mine. Career Jackson began climbing in the 1870s with her husband; together they made the first ascents of the Weissmies' east face in 1876 and the Dom's west ridge in 1878. Jackson's husband died in 1881 but she continued to climb, with increasing frequency. In 1884 she, Alois Pollinger (a Swiss mountain guide) and Johann-Josef Truffer became the first climbers to descend the west ridge of the Dent Blanche. With Pollinger, her most frequent climbing partner, she also climbed the Aiguille du Dru in 1886 and the Aiguille des Grands Charmoz in 1887. After 1887, Jackson became interested in pursuing alpine climbs in the winter season (she had previously climbed exclusively during summer). Her most famous expedition was made in January 1888: over twelve days, Jackson made the first winter ascents of the Lauteraarhorn, the Pfaffenst√∂ckli, and the Gross Fiescherhorn, followed by the first winter traverse of the Jungfrau‚Äîa feat that had previously been considered close to impossible. During a forced bivouac on the Jungfrau, Jackson developed severe frostbite resulting in the loss of several of her toes. Her frostbite injuries led to her retirement from serious climbing in 1889, by which time she had completed over 140 major climbs. In 1889, she wrote an account her Jungfrau expedition in the Alpine Journal, making her the first woman to be published in the journal under her own name. Death Jackson died of acute pneumonia in 1906, in her home in Paddington, London. Her husband had died in 1881 and they never had children.

Their self-titled album from 1975 reached No. 1 on the New Zealand Albums Chart, while \\"Put Another Log on the Fire\\" (December 1975) reached No. 5 on the related New Zealand Singles Chart and No. 23 in Australia. The duo continued together until 1989. Cate formed a self-titled trio.  History  William \\"Bill\\" Cate (born 1940) and William \\"Boyd\\" Robertson (born 1941) both attended Naenae College, a secondary school in Lower Hutt, in the mid-1950s. They started practising pop music in Robertson's bedroom and recorded a home version of \\"Angel\\" in about 1956. They formed a duo, Bill and Boyd, with both on lead vocals and lead guitar. They began public performances at local halls including a residency at Lower Hutt's Town Hall. Their early repertoire was cover versions of overseas artists, especially The Everly Brothers and Elvis Presley. In 1959 they supported local rock and roller, Johnny Devlin, in Wellington. By 1960 they had signed with Peak Records label, and issued five singles over the following year including \\"Fall in Love with You\\" and their cover of \\"Corrina, Corrina\\".

During February 1966 they supported an Australian tour by folk-pop group, The Seekers. The Canberra Times Garry Raffaele caught their performance in Canberra and felt the duo were \\"more suited to night-club work although they were very well received by last night's audience. Their boy-next-door image even allowed Boyd to get away with a couple of slightly queer jokes\\". In September 1967 Bill and Boyd's version of the Fiddler on the Roof track \\"If I Were a Rich Man\\" was issued on Sunshine Records and peaked at No. 24 on the Go-Set National Top 40. In 1968 they toured United States supporting The Supremes and Herb Alpert.

Asterinid sea stars are typically quite small with an often pentagonal-shaped body, though there are exceptions. They are dorsally flattened and have short arms. The body‚Äôs thin periphery is built up by very small marginal plates. One distinct characteristic of those in this family is the presence of an aboral face shaped by crescent-like plates.  Genus- Aquilonastra  Aquilonastra chantalae belongs to the genus Aquilonastra. Organisms within the genus Aquilonastra typically have five rays, commonly called arms. However, fissiparous species, those that reproduce by fission, can have from five to eight. Those of this genus resemble stars, with their inter-radial margins being incurved significantly.  Description  Aquilonastra chantalae is a fissiparous Aquilonastra species that can have a radius up to a size of 4mm. Organisms of this species generally have 5-7 rays, with the most prominent number being 6 and the most rare being 7. The rays are discrete with a wide basal end and taper distally to the rounded end. At a radial size of 4mm, the star may have rays 5. On the other hand, smaller stars could have up to 7 rays. Specimens of this kind have mostly digitiform abactinal spinelets. They also have actinal interradial spines which are predominantly subsacciform.  Biology  Though not much is known yet of the biological behaviors and properties specific to Aquilonastra chantalae, such information can be extrapolated from knowledge of the family of sea stars to which it belongs, Asterinidae. Most species of said family tend to live sequestered in crevices and under rocks. A great majority of Asterinidae, and likely Aquilonastra chantalae, feed on algal or bacterial mat and other floating fragments of food.  Distribution  This species can be found within the Mozambique Channel on the island of Europa and other scattered islands. It can also be found in the Indian Ocean.  Etymology  The species was named chantalae in reverence of the great contributions to the research of echinoderms done by Chantal Conand. Conand was a Professor at the University of La Reunion.

Biography Ifargan was born in 1966, in Netivot, a town in southern Israel, as the ninth and youngest child of Shalom and Esther Ifargan. In his childhood, he was no different than other children of his age, and did not exhibit unusual personality traits. Like most other residents of the town, the Ifargan family was a lower-class family who originally came from Tiznit, Morocco.Feldman, Anat. Mapping Religion and Spirituality in a Postsecular World. Chap. 5 Ifargan did not undergo formal rabbinic ordination.A 'baba' is born. Tamar Rotem. Oct. 2, 2005. He studied in a religious Yeshiva, but dropped out at the age of 17. He spent a year studying mysticism in seclusion, in the forests of northern Israel. Then, at the age of 18 he was enlisted to the Israeli army, and served for three years as required by law. When his father died in 1995, Ifargan began spreading legends on the mystical powers of his father, which he claimed had healing powers and predicted the future. He started performing spiritual activities out of his parents‚Äô house, as well as the gravesite estate that he purchased for his father, outside of the Netivot cemetery. Ifargan started claiming that he possessed prophetic powers, by which he can see the future as well as diagnose the health problems of people. A diverse community of miracle-seeking admirers began to form around the young mystic, then 30 years old. His followers were impressed with his supposed abilities, dubbing him \\"The X-ray\\". In 2008, Ifergan's \\"Netivot Shalom\\" list won four seats in the Netivot city council elections.Politicians seeking blessings flock to 'X-Ray Rabbi'. Yanir Yagna.

Tomer Zarchin. Aug. 27, 2010 Ifargan is also a rival of Netivot rabbi Yoram Abergel.

Yanir Yagna. Jun. 1, 2012 Tikkun ceremonies Ifargan erected a large, truncated pyramid shaped mausoleum for his father at the top of a hill, entirely covered in white marble. In this location he performs ceremonies, and most importantly, the Tikkun (reparation). The ceremonies are always opened by David Zarfati, Ifargan's master of ceremonies, who instructs the participants, who sing and clap their hands, while loud music is played. Ifargan throws thousands of candles into a bonfire, creating massive flames. Sometimes Ifargan places his hands in the fire but is not burned. Ifargan says that this is a Kabbalistic ceremony. In reality the ceremony is unique in form, and differs significantly from the traditional Kabbalistic Tikkun, which does not include a bonfire. The ceremony is preceded by prayer services and a collection of donations. Criticism The use of religion to gain profit, by Ifargan and other rabbis, drew criticism by other Jewish clerics, such as Rabbi Donniel Hartman, president of the Shalom Hartman Institute, who said \\"It's disappointing when religion descends to this... It's not some channel of divine power for personal wealth accumulation. That's small religion.\\" Ifargan wears modern Haredi dress. By doing so, Dr. Anat Feldman of the Achva Academic College, says he creates an image that he is part of the rabbinic establishment, thus gaining additional public legitimacy. However, some Haredi leaders including Rabbi Ovadia Yosef and Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky have denounced Ifergan‚Äôs magical practices.Sharon Shpurer and Yair Ettinger; With a little help from my friend (the rabbi).

The Wardour Abbey manor in Ecton had been in the family for three generations, having been purchased by Augustine's grandfather, William Nicolls or Nicoll, of Hardwicke, Northamptonshire, who died in 1575.

In 1940, she married the musicologist Lauro Ayestar√°n with whom she undertook research into Uruguayan dance. Thanks to the methodology she developed for reconstructing extinct dances, she and her husband revived over 20 folk dances from the colonial period, most of which had been completely forgotten. She became one of the most important researchers in the area, writing several books on the subject. In 1975, after Margaret Graham (1931‚Äì2004) had founded the National Dance School (Escuela Nacional de Danza), Rodr√≠guez became a co-founder of its Folklore Department where she taught dance theory and history of dance while giving practical training in ballet and dance. Additional support included theoretical subjects, such as theory of dance and folklore as well as musical literacy, didactic-pedagogical teacher training, and historical culture, including history of clothing. The division is named Flor de Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez de Ayestar√°n in her honor. In 1977, she received the Gold Award at the National Folklore Festival for her extensive contributions.

The film was one of the most popular Turkish comedy films released in 1980's. Plot Bilo (Ilyas Salman) is an unemployed youth living in a small village in Turkey. With the promise to be brought to Munich, he and his best friend Ibrahim are scammed by Maho, Bilo's childhood friend. They are set off in Istanbul instead and after losing Ibo, Bilo is forced to make a living in the city and he is faced by problems which brings comical elements in the film. He starts as construction worker first and learns very soon about how everything works through bribery and tries different jobs such as travelling vegetable salesman and cigarette dealer. His naivety and unawareness brings him into trouble and he ends up being beaten. Soon he encounters Ibo again, who has become corrupted through the city as he asks Bilo for money in exchange of accommodation in an illegally built house he doesn't even own. During a working day, Bilo and Maho encounter and Maho offers Bilo to work together. The two enter into oil business, which is, in fact, part of the black market since oil is in shortage in the city. After a report to the police, presumably made by Maho, Bilo is arrested and sentenced to five years of prison since he is the sole official owner. During these five years, Maho, who is known as Mahmut, greatly improves his business. He starts building a set of dwelling apartments, befriends a loanshark, marries his daughter, Necla, and becomes a banker himself. Although promised, he never visits Bilo at all, but owns a plastics production factory and several apartments in a row. After that time, Bilo is released and departs to find Ibo, who has become a full-time tobacco and spirituose dealer. He is offered a job, but Bilo turns it down. Furthermore, Bilo is surprised when he learns that Zeyno, Bilo's love interest, and her parents have moved to Istanbul. After reuniting with Zeyno and her parents, Bilo is offered a job in a plastics factory by Zeyno's father. To Bilo's surprise, the factory owner is none other than Mahmut himself. Mahmut, who is well aware of Bilo's honesty, hires him as a janitor for one of his apartments instead. There, it is revealed that Zeyno is actually working as a maid for Mahmut and he, too, is interested in her despite being married. Zeyno only accepts Mahmut's advancements because he promised to divorce from his wife and marry her. Necla gets suspicious that her husband might be cheating on her while she is away, so Mahmut organizes a plot: He fakes an engagement between Bilo and Zeyno so Necla would think that there is actually nothing between them since she got engaged by her free will. Bilo, unaware of this plot, is overjoyed by this and thanks Mahmut for supporting this. Mahmut gets an opportunity to take over a soft drink factory in Germany, but he is hesitant to sign the contract since he can't trust any of his power-hungry executives. Departing to another country would need a temporary director, who would be able to do anything with Mahmut's companies as long as he is abroad. A sudden twist of the events changes Mahmut's mind: Mahmut asks Bilo to use the janitor's apartment to meet his secret lover, to which Bilo agrees out of his friendship. As the other janitors warn him that the secret lover is none other than Zeyno, Bilo is enraged as he finds them together. Realizing that Bilo won't even turn against Mahmut even under such circumstances, he decides to give Bilo control over all his companies and departs to Germany, with the intention of getting rid of Bilo once and for all afterwards. During this one week, Bilo uses this power to change the ownership of everything Maho is owning: His construction company, his plastic factory, his apartments, his office, his accounts, everything. Mahmut is thrown out of his own apartment and an entrance is denied to him. A brief confrontation with Bilo ends up bitterly for Mahmut. Bilo has successfully taken his revenge on Mahmut. Immediately after that, Zeyno and her parents confront him with the hope that Bilo would forgive them. Bilo brashes them and reveals that he is engaged to Mahmut's ex-wife Necla and left his honest ways once and for all, explaining that he, as a banker and factory owner, has nothing to do with a simple maid and all the people around him have killed his old self together.

Political career  = Early years in Roswell = Although his income was earned from oil and gas interests, Max W. Coll II's primary career was that of politician. Once elected to the New Mexico House of Representatives representing a Chaves County district from 1966 to 1970 as a Republican, Coll served as Republican Legislative Whip, and as a delegate to the state's last Constitutional Convention in 1969. Always concerned about the environment and social justice issues, Coll introduced a bill requiring deposits on bottles and cans during his first term, and supported the country's Equal Rights Amendment, which wasn't ratified by New Mexico until 1972.A Memorial = Icon of Santa Fe = After moving to the state's capitol of Santa Fe, Coll once again returned to politics in the 1980s, elected to represent Santa Fe's District 47 in 1981 as a Republican. To the surprise of many, in 1983 Coll changed parties from Republican to Democrat in order to tip the partisan balance in the House, and to get more Democrats to support his bills. Despite his change of party, Coll was re-elected by District 47's voters for 15 consecutive terms, usually with a landslide vote in his favor.\\"DISTRICT 47 HIGHLIGHTS OPPOSITES IN OUTLOOK\\" Santa Fe New Mexican [Santa Fe, NM] October 25, 2000: B-1.

Coll also served on the House Taxation and Revenue Committee and as head of the Legislative Finance Committee, which serves as the permanent budget oversight panel to New Mexico's legislature. Despite his liberal stances on social justice and the environment, Coll was considered a fiscal conservative and managed the state's finances under five different governors from both parties, locking horns with both Republicans and Democrats to protect the state's money. Coll described his views to a reporter during his 2000 campaign as, \\"I think we really need to work on overcoming poverty and ignorance and poor health care... I think we should target those things, and I think government has a big role in those things.\\" After he retired in 2004, Coll remained interested in politics, consulting with legislators who sought his advice, and even lecturing on techniques of successful lobbying at a workshop given by the League of Women Voters of New Mexico in 2007.\\"GETTING HEARD\\" Santa Fe New Mexican [Santa Fe, NM] January 14, 2007: SS-17.

Coll felt that if he were to sponsor a great number of bills, his position of power might be weakened by the need to negotiate in a variety of directions. Instead, Coll sponsored a few pet bills each session, and was satisfied to throw his weight behind a colleague when he or she introduced a bill Coll could support.\\"ELDORADO ISSUES ON LAWMAKER'S AGENDA\\" Santa Fe New Mexican [Santa Fe, NM] February 28, 2001: E-1. Infotrac Newsstand. Web. April 18, 2014. Coll was occasionally known to be a stickler for the letter of the law. The lawsuit which gained Coll the most notoriety was brought in 1995. Coll, along with state Representative George Buffett, R-Albuquerque, and Guy Clark of the New Mexico Coalition Against Gambling petitioned together against then-Governor Gary Johnson for forming gaming compacts with state tribes without legislative approval. The case ended up before the New Mexico Supreme Court, which declared the gambling compacts between New Mexico tribes and then-Governor Gary Johnson void. The next year, due to inaccurate reporting by the Albuquerque Journal, this action got confused in the minds of some with a federal lawsuit brought by different plaintiffs seeking to declare casinos illegal in New Mexico. This confusion resulted in the formation by Pojoaque Pueblo members of a political action committee called \\"K'ema\\" or Tewa for friend, the sole goal of which was to defeat Coll's re-election on the grounds that he was racist. In reply, Coll held that, \\"I'm going to run my campaign like I always have. I have long taken the position that Native Americans don't have a fair piece of the pie, and I'm going to continue to work on that.\\" \\"CORRECTION: Pojoaque Group Against Coll\\" Albuquerque Journal [Albuquerque, NM] September 7, 1996 Despite K'ema's donation of $100,000 to his Republican opponent, Coll won his election and the Pojoaque Pueblo now operates a large casino outside Santa Fe.

Infotrac Newsstand. Web. April 18, 2014 Never shy to be honest about his personal life, Coll often cited experience in his reasons for backing certain bills. In a battle with then- Governor Gary Johnson over a plan to place the state's Medicaid program in the hands of managed healthcare, Coll's objections included the death of his daughter. Coll told the Legislative Finance Committee in 1996 that his daughter's symptoms would have been noticed and addressed had she been allowed by her managed care to see the same doctor at each visit. As it was, a benign tumor that went undetected caused her to die, along with the baby girl she had carried for almost nine months. About managed-care systems, \\"\\"It may be saving money, but at what cost? It's very, very shabby care.\\" Coll said. \\"When are we going to quit kidding ourselves that we're going to save money by cutting services to poor people? It's outrageous.\\" Accusing these systems of caring only for profits and not for patients, Coll added, \\"They basically get around [costs] by not doing tests that people need.\\" \\"Daughter's Death Turns Coll Into Foe of Medicaid Plan.\\" Albuquerque Tribune [Albuquerque, NM] July 18, 1996: A10. Then, in February 1999, the N.M. House proposed a bill that would require those with multiple convictions for Driving Under the Influence (DUI) to pay for the installation of, and use, ignition inter-lock devices on their vehicles for six months before having their driving privileges restored. Coll proposed a tougher amendment, which was defeated, that the devices be required after the first DUI conviction. He explained his request for stiffer penalties by saying, \\"Take it from an old alcoholic who used to drive drunk a lot . . . what we need is severe dealing with drunken driving. Drunk drivers are usually people with a drinking problem. They're not casual drinkers.\\"\\"House passes bill on ignition interlocks\\" Albuquerque Tribune [Albuquerque, NM] February 27, 1999: A4. Infotrac Newsstand. Web. April 19, 2014 = Colorful character = New Mexican by birth, Coll began his career in Roswell wearing a crewcut that had become an unruly mop of grey by the time he returned to politics in Santa Fe. Also wearing glasses (and eventually hearing aids), Coll was broad- shouldered and stood just over 6' 2\\" tall. After his return to New Mexico's House in the 1980s, he was usually seen wearing a stud earring in each ear, a turquoise watchband, and a brightly-colored vest on the Capitol Floor. (Although he also was famous for his impressive collection of bolo ties, Coll could only wear those to committee meetings, since bolos were outlawed by the Capitol's dress code until 2009, after he retired.\\"High Point: To Bolo or Not\\" Albuquerque Journal (NM) - Sunday, February 1, 2009) Despite his size and strong opinions, Coll was soft-spoken and known for a wry sense of humor. Among his colleagues, Coll gained a reputation for drawing caricatures depicting his viewpoint of their bills, arguments or behavior during legislative sessions and committee meetings. He would later present these to those colleagues, to be kept and cherished, at least by some. Coll also was known for his colorful expressions. In 1991, he responded to an interviewer's question, \\"Is there a cheaper way to raise revenue other than the gross receipts tax?\\" by saying, \\"If frogs had wings, then they wouldn't bump their tails on the rocks.\\" \\"Rep.

Photo by Barry Massey.  Family and personal history  Coll's maternal grandfather was another career politician. New Mexico's sixth governor, Democrat James Fielding Hinkle, moved to the southwest from Missouri where he managed the Penasco Valley's CA Bar Ranch in the 1890s. Before becoming elected as governor in 1922, Hinkle had served as both county commissioner and county treasurer for Lincoln County. Even before New Mexico achieved statehood, Hinkle served as a member of the Territorial Tax Board for 11 years, was elected to the Territorial House of Representatives in 1892, and then to the Territorial Senate in 1901. Switching from state to local politics briefly, Hinkle served as mayor of Roswell from 1904 to 1906. Once New Mexico achieved statehood, Hinkle campaigned and won election to the state senate in 1912, where he served a total of three terms before he was elected Governor of New Mexico in 1922.http://newmexicohistory.org/people/james-f- hinklehttp://worldconnect.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi- bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db;=wjhonson&id;=I63408 Max W. Coll, II, was born February 26, 1932, in Roswell, New Mexico, to Max Welton Coll and Lillian Hinkle Coll and was the eldest of four sons. Coll graduated from New Mexico Military Institute's Junior College and went on to the University of Missouri, where he graduated with a BS in Chemistry in 1954. He married Martha Lou McGranahan on July 5, 1952. They had three children: Melanie Ann, Kristi Colleen (deceased 1991) and Max Welton Coll III (Tres). During his first marriage, Coll served for three years in the United States Army in Germany. Coll and McGranahan ended their marriage December 22, 1969. After the divorce, Coll moved to Albuquerque to attend Law School at the University of New Mexico School of Law where he graduated in 1974. He married his second wife, Sally Rodgers, on September 20, 1975 and moved to Santa Fe where he established a Law practice. Coll and Rodgers divorced on May 20, 2001.\\"FORMER LEGISLATOR STILL STAYS ACTIVE IN RAFTING, POLICY.\\" Santa Fe New Mexican [Santa Fe, NM] October 3, 2010: C. Infotrac Newsstand. Web.

When he passed the Fine Arts Education Act of 2003, he credited his wife, long a supporter of the Arts. The bill established and funded art, music, dance and drama in grade schools. As a result, the New Mexico Art Education Association was formed by the art teachers who then established \\"The Max Coll and Catherine Joyce-Coll Award for Excellence in Arts Education\\" to honor the couple.

He is married to Wendy Schwartz with whom he has three children (two of whom are lawyers). He is currently a lecturer at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.  Early life and education  Selikowitz was born on 11 April 1942 in Cape Town, South Africa. He attended the Hertzlia primary and high schools, graduating from high school in 1959.http://www.herzlia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Headline-Dec-20091.pdf He then graduated from a Bachelor of Arts in 1963 and received his LLB (with Honours) in 1965. Selikowitz was admitted as an advocate in 1966 and took silk in 1983.  Legal Profession  Selikowitz became a member of the Cape Bar in 1966. He was appointed to the Cape Bench in 1987. He also served on the Bar Council from 1974-1987.http://www.sabar.co.za/law- journals/2002/august/2002-august-vol015-no2-p20.pdf  Controversies  Former apartheid strongman and President of South Africa P. W. Botha won his appeal against a conviction of contempt handed down for his refusal to testify before South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commissionabout anti-apartheid crimes. Judge Selikowitz (with whom Judge Foxcroft, concurred) upheld Botha's appeal on technical grounds and set aside his sentence of a 10,000 rand (pounds 1,000) fine or 12 months in jail for defying a truth commission subpoena. After a trial lasting months, a regional court convicted the former president of contempt for ignoring summonses to testify in person before the commission, which was trying to uncover the chain of command behind murders, bombings and the torture of anti-apartheid activists during his rule. Botha was sentenced by a Black Regional Court President and when Selikowitz overturned the conviction on a technicality some South Africans were outraged. Some saw the decision as a catalyst to ignite racial tensions in South Africa as it was made on the eve of Nelson Mandela's departure from the Presidency. In his judgment, reported as S v BOTHA 1999 (2) SACR 261 (C), Selikowitz stated at p. 271: \\"I should like to record that this Court is mindful of the fact that there will be many who may consider that it is unjust that the appellant should succeed in his appeal upon the basis that the s 29(1)(c) notice issued by the TRC and served on him on 5 December 1997, was unauthorised because it was prematurely issued. Indeed, Mr Morrison submitted that this Court should not permit the appellant to take what he called 'technical points' because of the intransigent and obdurate attitude which the appellant had demonstrated towards the TRC. The TRC was established to perform a noble and invaluable task for our country. It remains, however, a statutory body clothed only with the powers that the Legislature has given it. This Court is duty-bound to uphold and protect the Constitution and to administer justice to all persons alike without fear, favour or prejudice, in accordance with the Constitution and the law. Suffice it to say that the same law, the same Constitution which obliges the appellant to obey the law of the land like every other citizen, also affords him the same protections that it affords every other citizen.\\"  Career at UNSW  Selikowitz is currently a visiting Professorial Fellow at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. = Hobbies and pastimes = Selikowitz's hobbies include wine collecting (and tasting); the outdoors (wildlife - animals and birds) and walking on the slopes of Table Mountain.

Craig Hanna was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1967. He has been drawing since his childhood. He earned his BFA from Syracuse University in 1994 and his MFA from the School of Visual Arts in 1996. He started doing figurative classical painting from life at that time. His teacher John Foot introduced him to the Great Masters of figurative painting, such as Rembrandt, Velasquez, Sargent and Ingres. The Metropolitan Museum of Art played an important role in the painter‚Äôs artistic education.H.

After his first Parisian exhibition in June 2008, he chose to settle in Paris. In September 2008, Laurence Esnol Gallery opened to solely represent the works of H. Craig Hanna.Alexandre Crochet, \\"Laurence Esnol, L'obsession Craig Hanna\\", Le Figaro Magazine, 2010  Art  The work of H. Craig Hanna continues in the tradition of Ancient Masters. His choices in terms of framing, color, composition and model root him in his time and century. His influences range from classical western painting (Titian, Rembrandt, Velasquez) to masters of the 19th century (Sargent, Whistler) and of the 20th century (Klimt, Schiele, Lucian Freud). Ancient Greek sculpture is also a major source of inspiration. His portraits convey a strong human dimension, with particular emphasis on the subject's vulnerability, mitigated by a sense of benevolence. H. Craig Hanna often chooses his models according to their distinctive intensity. Each portrait is hence an expression of the model's singularity.H. Craig Hanna - \\"Peintures et Dessins\\"': \\"...As a figurative painter I'm quite obsessed with faces. I love painting people's faces. It's amazing how every single face is different in so many ways.\\" Hanna's technical mastery expresses itself in many ways, from oil paint on wood or canvas to works on paper (oil pastel, pencil, charcoal‚Ä¶). The use of reverse plexiglas paint was a breakthrough in his work. Experimenting with the possibilities of this technique, playing with the effects of depth and transparency for instance, enabled him to explore new artistic paths. Journalist and art critic Christopher Mooney describes his work as following: ‚ÄòWhile antecedents are visible in HANNA‚Äôs pictures, in both their contents and surfaces (...) HANNA pushes past these to create vital works that are brashly contemporary and unmistakably his own.‚Äô H. Craig Hanna does so ‚Äòby eschewing, even sabotaging, the strategies of most contemporary figurative painting: he chooses his subjects from ‚Äúlife‚Äù instead of photographs; he roots his formal concerns‚Äîline, color, brushstroke, scale‚Äîin painterly traditions; and, borrowing a forgotten form of outsider ‚Äúfolk‚Äù art‚Äîfix√© sous verre in French, Hinterglasmalerei in German, ‚Äúreverse-painting‚Äù in English ‚Äîhe inverts the usual process of painting by doing it backwards, on Plexiglas.‚Äô  Recognition and honors  In 2001, H. Craig Hanna was commended in the London National Portrait Gallery contest for his painting Carlos Sitting in a Clear Plastic Chair. His work was exhibited at the Orangerie du S√©nat in Paris in 2010Peintures et dessins de H. Craig Hanna √† l'Orangerie du S√©nat , art√©M√©dia and the National Fine Art Museum in Malta in 2006. H.

In 1995, she founded the group Berta Pereira y las Comadres, which focuses on Afro-Uruguayan music and folklore. The band is well known for their candombe style of music and their participation in Memoria para armar, a musical performance and dramatic reading of testimonies by women imprisoned under the Uruguayan military dictatorship in the 1970's and 1980's. Biography Born in Montevideo, Pereira grew up in a musical family, with both of her parents playing the guitar. Her sister, a guitar teacher, taught her to play when she was only five. She went on to study the Uruguayan harp with Carlos Vega while taking lessons in ballet and contemporary dance. At the time, during the era of the Uruguayan dictatorship, the College of Fine Arts was closed, and Pereira took various classes in the workshop of Zina Fern√°ndez: ceramics, drawing, painting, batik and goldsmithing.

This opening consists of a group of women percussionists with large drums singing, yelling, and applauding while acting out the washing of clothing (white cloth) in a very afro-centric style. Pereira, who enters the stage carrying a bundle of laundry on her head, states \\"Traje un mont√≥n de ropa para lavar. Tengo tanta historia para lavar.\\" (\\"I brought a ton of laundry to wash. I have so much history to wash.\\") Throughout the rest of the performance, Pereira and the Comadres' candombe music is interspersed with four women reading from the testimonies of the former prisoners and their families about life during the dictatorship.

Mummery in the 1890s. Biography Bristow was born in Brixton, Surrey, to George Ledgard Bristow and his wife, Mary.1871 England Census She made her first significant mountain ascent in 1892 when she climbed the Aiguille des Grands Charmoz in the Mont Blanc massif with Albert F. Mummery and his wife Mary. With their success, Bristow and Mary Mummery became the first women to climb the mountain. In 1893, Bristow climbed the Aiguille du Gr√©pon‚Äîthe ascent for which she was best known. This was the second-ever traverse of the Gr√©pon, which had first been climbed by Albert Mummery two years earlier. The same year, she successfully climbed the Aiguille du Dru, the Zinalrothorn and the Matterhorn. She was known for climbing without local guides and for occasionally leading her climbing parties' ascents. Bristow's guideless ascent of the Gr√©pon inspired Mummery to write: \\"All mountains appear doomed to pass through three stages: An inaccessible peak, the hardest climb in the Alps, an easy day for a lady.\\" It was noted that Bristow caused scandal amongst her acquaintances by choosing to share tents with men. Some have speculated that Mary Mummery later forbade her husband from climbing with Bristow, since Bristow did not accompany him on any of his 1894 expeditions, and there are no records of Bristow continuing her climbing career following his death on Nanga Parbat in 1895. Elisa Kay Sparks has speculated that Lily Briscoe, a character in Virginia Woolf's novel To the Lighthouse, was named after Bristow.

Like all members of the family, these are air breathing fishes that frequently inhabit oxygen poor environments hostile to other fishes (the licorice gouramies of Parosphromenus inhabit well-oxygenated, but extremely soft and acidic, blackwater streams). They are native to Asia, from Pakistan and India to the Malay Archipelago and north-easterly towards Korea. Many members are common aquarium fish; by far the most famous is the Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens (note that the domesticated form is very likely a hybrid). Most (not all) of the 70+ betta species are paternal mouthbrooders; the remaining members of the subfamily are bubblenesters like most osphronemids. The subfamily was originally named Macropodinae but this name was adjudged to be a junior homonym of the mammalian family Macropodidae, the kangaroos and wallabies, and the name was changed by ICZN Opinion 2058 to Macropodusinae. Genera The following genera are classified within in this subfamily. Betta is by far the largest genus with over 70 species (more than the rest of the subfamily combined and easily the largest osphronemid genus), followed by Parosphromenus (which, with at least 20 species, is the next most speciose osphronemid genus). * Betta Bleeker 1849 * Macropodus Lacep√®de, 1801 * Malpulutta Deraniyagala, 1937 * Parosphromenus Bleeker, 1877 * Pseudosphromenus Bleeker, 1879 * Trichopsis Canestrini, 1860 Gallery Image:Betta albimarginata 060311 1.jpgBetta albimarginata Image:Kampffisch betta splendenscele4.jpgSiamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) Image:Makropode_Quang_Binh-Makropode_060114_1.jpgRed-backed paradise fish Image:Makropode_Makropodus_opercularis_060114_1.jpgParadise fish (Macropodus opercularis) References Category:Osphronemidae ","title":"Macropodusinae"},{"id":"42341929","title":"Controversia (album)"}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:T},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},B={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your ETHü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",B,[(t(!0),o(h,null,p(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(R,[["render",I]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/55.md","filePath":"sponsor/55.md"}'),D={name:"sponsor/55.md"},x=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{F as __pageData,x as default};
