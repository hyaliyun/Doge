During his Major League Baseball career, spent entirely with the New York Giants of the National League, the second baseman appeared in 517 games over six seasons (1949; 1951‚àí1955), and was selected to the 1953 NL All-Star team. Williams was listed as tall and , and batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Dallas, Texas, where he graduated from Sunset High School in 1945. Williams in 1953 Playing career Williams' most productive major league season came in 1952, when he posted career-highs in home runs (13), runs (70), RBI (48) and extra-base hits (42), with a .254 batting average in 138 games. In 1953, he hit a career-best .297, which him earned a selection to the NL All-Star squad. In the 1953 Midsummer Classic, played July 14 at Crosley Field, Cincinnati, Williams took over from Red Schoendienst as the National League's second sacker in the seventh inning with the Nationals leading 2‚Äì0. He draw a base on balls off Mike Garcia in his only plate appearance and played errorless ball in the field as the Senior Circuit won, 5‚Äì1.Retrosheet box score: 1953 MLB All-Star Game Then, in , Williams played in a career-high 142 games, starting all but one of them as the Giants' second baseman. His batting average fell to .222, but the Giants captured the National League pennant. In the 1954 World Series that followed, Williams started all four games of the Fall Classic. He went hitless in 11 at bats with a run batted in and handled 20 chances with one error, as the Giants swept away the Cleveland Indians to become world champions. However, 1954 was his last full season as a player. On April 23, 1955, Williams severely injured his back in an on-field collision with Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers ‚Äî the result of a brushback battle between the two bitter rivals. The Giants' pitcher, Sal \\"The Barber\\" Maglie, was notorious for knocking batters down at the plate. Maglie had angered the Dodgers by throwing several pitches high and inside on Brooklyn hitters, including a pitch that sailed behind Robinson's head. In the fourth inning, Robinson dropped down a bunt, intending to retaliate for the knockdown pitch by crashing into Maglie as he fielded the ball. But Maglie did not come off the pitching mound and Robinson instead collided with Williams, who was covering first base. Robinson later said that his intended target on the play had been Maglie. Williams was able to finish the game and appear in 82 games for the 1955 Giants. But he reinjured his back in midseason and persistent back pain forced his retirement as a player at the age of 27. In a six-season career, Williams was a .252 hitter (450-for-1,785) with 32 home runs and 163 RBI in 517 games, including 235 runs, 163 RBI, 61 doubles, 10 triples and six stolen bases. A good contact, free swinger hitter, he collected 164 walks and 144 strikeouts in 1,993 plate appearances. At second base, he recorded a .978 fielding percentage (52 errors in 2,323 chances). Coach and manager Immediately following his playing career, Williams coached for the Giants in and , their final two seasons in New York before their move to San Francisco. He briefly managed the Dallas Rangers of the Double-A Texas League in 1958 before leaving baseball. Williams died in Dallas at the age of 81.

It was divided into the national bodies (the monarch, Privy Council, and Parliament), the regional bodies (the Council of the North and Council of the Marches), the county, community bodies and the court system. Structure =National bodies= Privy Council The Privy Council was Elizabeth's group of advisers. Its main purpose was to give numerous different opinions and the monarch decided on the issue at hand. (However, the advice was often ignored; the Council still carried out her wishes.) Routine administration was usually left to the Council. It was involved in matters of religion, military, the queen's security, economics, and the welfare of the citizens. It dealt with both matters of national and individual interest, issued proclamations in the queen's name, and supervised law and enforcement. The Council could make decisions, but the monarch could veto anything without question. Who was in it depended on who the queen wanted there. However, certain powerful noblemen were necessary in the Council so that their and their realms' interests were represented so that a rebellion would be avoided. Believing that more members (and therefore more different opinions) would cause more problems, Elizabeth dropped the previous member count of 50 to 19 and eventually 11 by 1597. The Counselors employed assistants who did most of the work. At first, they met only 3 times a week; by the end of Elizabeth's reign, they met almost every day. The Secretary of State led the Council. Sir William Cecil effectively led it; he was wise, cautious, cooperative with Elizabeth, trusted above all others, Elizabeth's personal secretary, and chief adviser until his death, and therefore very influential; due to his great administrative ability, he had the reputation of one of the greatest English statesmen ‚Äì historians have even debated whether the success of Elizabeth's rule was more due to Sir William Cecil or Elizabeth. His son was also a member of Queen Elizabeth's Privy council. Parliament The group of representatives, called Parliament, was divided into the House of Lords (or the Upper House), which consisted of nobility and higher clergy such as bishops and archbishops, and the House of Commons (or the Lower House), which consisted of common people. Unlike the modern British Parliament, it had much less power, no Prime Minister or cabinet, and no political parties. The main function of Parliament was dealing with financial matters (taxation and granting the queen money). Generally, the monarch paid for daily administration with ordinary revenues (customs, feudal dues, and sales of land) while Parliament covered extraordinary expenditures (such as war) with taxation. However, taxation didn't supply enough for military expenditures; therefore, more land was sold along with probably illegal scheming. Parliament was also used for passing laws. 438 laws were passed under Elizabeth's reign. They were either public, in which case they applied to all, or private, in which case they only applied to certain people. Only another Parliament could undo one. They required approval by both houses thrice and the queen. However, the queen could make Royal Proclamations without Parliament's consent. Another purpose of Parliament was to advise. Nonetheless, Elizabeth was almost never interested in Parliament's advice. Elections occurred only for the House of Commons. Who was in Parliament depended mainly on who was supported by the important local people. Only those that were male and received a certain annual income could vote. The monarch decided when Parliament was to be called. In total, Elizabeth only called Parliament thirteen times, 11 of which were to ask for money. =Local Governments= Local governments were important in Tudor England. Royal representatives (Justices of the Peace, Sheriffs, and Lords Lieutenant) were appointed in every county; they ensured that the queen's commands and laws were obeyed. Regional governments helped oversee parts of England that the Privy Council could not supervise. The Council of the North, which resided in York, oversaw Northern England, while the Council of the Marches, which resided in Ludlow, oversaw Wales and some border counties. Manors were run by nobility and gentry. Land was power at the time; those with land received payments from the tenants on their land and from their workers. Thus they had significant wealth and influence. They also had responsibilities, for they were meant to aid the monarch by governing their land. Local grievances were taken to the lord of the manor; on the other hand, tenants were loyal to him ‚Äì if called upon, they were obliged to go to war. The lord's views tended to greatly influence those of his largely uneducated tenants. Each city and town had its own government, headed by a mayor as well. =Courts= The courts made up the judicial system of Elizabethan England. The most important courts were the Great Sessions Courts or the Assizes, which were held twice a year in each county, and the Quarter Sessions Courts, which were held four times in a year. These two dealt with most crimes. The Assizes was famous for its power to inflict harsh punishments. Unimportant crimes were handled by the Petty Sessions Courts, Manor Courts, and town courts. Civil cases were dealt with by various courts, depending on the person's monetary status; the wealthy were tried by the Star Chamber, one of the highest profile courts which consisted of mostly Privy Counselors. The Court of Chancery also judged criminal cases, the Exchequer of Pleas dealt with financial suits, the Court of Requests with the poor (\\"the court of the poor man‚Äôs causes,\\" as it was known), Church Courts with religious and moral cases, and other specific courts with other specific matters. Committers of high treason and other serious crimes received the death sentence (often handled by the queen). Often a violent death sentence in the case of high treason involving being hanged, taken down before dead, dragged face downward through the streets, and then hacked into four pieces or quartered only to have the remains displayed in a public place to discourage others from committing treason. Those of lesser crimes were sent to prison or the stocks. Uses of the pillory, ducking stool, the Brank, The Drunkards Cloak, Burning, the Wheel and other forms of punishment and torture were also common during this time. Domestic policy A strict aristocracy helped Elizabeth maintain the dominance of her reign. She also had thousands of guards enforcing the city and the castle in case of any riots. If riots were to happen, there would be fireballs made of rock strewn and shot at the rioters. Foreign Policy Elizabethan government concerning foreign policy is often accused of being affected by factionalism. This appears true in the later part of her reign, post-Armada, when factions led by the Earl of Essex, and the Cecils, argued over which way the war against Spain should proceed. Essex, keen for glory and prestige, favored an expensive land based military strategy, whilst the Cecil faction advocated a cheaper moderate naval strategy. Due to the conflicting factions no policy was explicitly followed and each side frequently tried to undermine the others, resulting in a confused foreign policy. Faction pre-Armada is harder to analyze. The traditional view put forward by Read and Neale, suggests that William Cecil (later Lord Burghley) was continually in faction against Robert Dudley, over issues such as marriage and most importantly intervention in the Netherlands. Revisionist historian Adams defines faction as \\"one group of people employed in direct opposition to another.\\" It is on this premise that historians such as John Guy argue there was no true faction in the Council at this stage, disagreements were primarily over individual opinions, and judgements over how to proceed; all councilors, after the removal of conservative Norfolk, were agreed that Elizabeth should look to further and protect the Protestant cause. Leicester and Walsingham saw intervention in the Netherlands as the best way to achieve this, whilst Cecil was more moderate. Impact The Elizabethan Era is famous for its playwrights (William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, and Ben Jonson) that thrived during this period; Francis Drake, the first Englishman to circumnavigate the world; and Sir Walter Raleigh's exploration of the New World. The stability and structure of the government helped to allow the arts to flourish and prompted other achievements in exploration.

At the time of recording, the band was living in Crawley but involved in running events at Brighton nightclub The Basement. The brothers Nick and Jeff Pitcher shared DJ duties at the club, playing 1960s and 1970s psychedelia and garage rock; bands like the MC5, The Stooges and The Ramones had a huge influence on the album's sound. Electric Colour Climax had a harder rock sound than the band's previous album, Sex Bomb, and seemed even more at odds with the Britpop movement that was prevalent around the time of its release. However, members of Britpop bands Elastica, Menswe@r, Lush and Supergrass were seen wearing Spitfire's distinctive badges, featuring an 'S' logo stolen from TV programme World of Sport. The 14 tracks that make up Electric Colour Climax were recorded from 9-13 March 1996 at ToeRag Studios, Shoreditch, London. (with the exception of track 5, Rip My Sweetheart). All tracks were written by Jeff and Nick Pitcher, with musicians sharing writing credits on 6 tracks. The core of Spitfire was still the Pitcher brothers, Jeff on vocals and Nick on bass and guitars. Drummer Justin Welch had left before this album to join Elastica and for a short time it seemed that Lush's Chris Ackland might fill the vacancy.

OCRopus is developed under the lead of Thomas Breuel from the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Kaiserslautern, Germany and was sponsored by Google.  Description  OCRopus was especially designed for use in high-volume digitization projects of books, such as Google Books, Internet Archive or libraries. A large number of languages and fonts are to be supported. However, it can also be used for desktop and office applications or for application for the visually impaired people. The main components of OCRopus are formed: * analysis of the document layout * optical character recognition * use of statistical language models Single or multiple scripts are available for these components. The modular approach allows individual workflows to be used and individual steps to be exchanged. By default, OCRopus comes with a model for English texts and a model for text in Fraktur. These models refer to the script and are largely independent of the actual language. New characters or language variants can be trained either new or in addition. Recent text recognition is based on recurrent neural networks (LSTM) and does not require a language model. This makes it possible to train language-independent models for which good recognition results for English, German and French have been shown at the same time. In addition to the Latin script, there are results for other scripts such as Sanskrit, Urdu, Devanagari and Greek. Very good detection rates can be achieved through an appropriate training. This extra effort is particularly worthwhile for difficult documents or scripts that are no longer common today, which are not in the focus of other OCR software.  History  On 9 April 2007, OCRopus was announced as a Google-sponsored project to develop advanced OCR technologies. Funding was granted for a period of three years and covered in particular PhD and postdoctoral positions at DFKI and the University of Kaiserslautern. In return, OCRopus was also used for automatic text recognition in Google Book Search. Licensing under an open source license was made right from the start to facilitate collaboration between industrial and academic research. OCRopus has received further funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the BMBF. The first alpha version 0.1 was released on 22 October 2007 and several pre-releases followed between December 2007 and May 2009 reaching a stable version 0.4.4 in March 2010. Originally, the software was developed in C++, Python and Lua with Jam as a build system. A complete refactoring of the source code in Python modules was done and released in version 0.5 (June 2012). Initially, Tesseract was used as the only text recognition module. Since 2009 (version 0.4) Tesseract was only supported as a plugin. Instead, a self-developed text recognizer (also segment-based) was used.OCRopus doesn't even link with Tesseract by default. This recognizer was then used together with OpenFSTOfficial OpenFST website. for language modeling after the recognition step. From 2013 onwards, an additional recognition with recurrent neural networks (LSTM) was offered, which with the release of version 1.0 in November 2014 is the only recognizer. The source code is managed over GitHub and is maintained and developed by a developer community. The current version of OCRopus is 1.3.3 (December 2017).  Usage  320px OCRopus can be used from the command line. Once installed, it can be invoked by specifying the input images. It will output the recognized text to standard output directly or write it as hOCR (HTML-based) code into files, from which it then can be transformed to a searchable PDF. If more precise control is needed, options can be specified on the command line to perform specific operations (e.g. recognizing a single line).

The exterior of the building features a large tin-clad, steel-framed blue dome and a yellow brick facade. The industrial interior has a large atrium with exposed steel girders and skylights above.

The Boston, Massachusetts architectural firm of Peabody and Stearns designed the building. Motor Square Garden soon failed as a retail space, but in 1915 the new Pittsburgh Automobile Association bought it as a site for its auto shows. In the 1920s, it came into use as a sports venue, especially for boxing, and was used intermittently as the home court of the University of Pittsburgh's basketball team until the opening of Pitt Pavilion inside Pitt Stadium in 1925.Sam Sciullo, Jr. Pitt: 100 Years of Pitt Basketball pg. 14-17 By the 1940s it was used as a new car dealership.

He also served as a Dean of the Faculty of Humanities from 1995 to 2000.http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/philos/dascal/ Academic career Marcelo Dascal graduated from a philosophy and electrical engineering faculty at the University of S√£o Paulo, Brazil. He studied linguistics and epistemology in Aix-en- Provence (France) and obtained his Ph.D. at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, under the supervision of Yehoshua Bar-Hillel. In Israel he became a teacher at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Ben- Gurion University of the Negev. At this university he founded and led the Department of Philosophy. Abroad, he taught at different well-known educational institutions such as the University of S√£o Paulo, Bras√≠lia, Campinas and Unisinos (Brazil), Lisboa (Portugal), Lugano (Switzerland), Massachusetts (Amherst), California (Berkeley), Monash (Melbourne, Australia), UNAM and UAM (Mexico), Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (Paris), Universit√© de la Sorbonne Nouvelle (Paris III), Universit√† degli Studi di Bologna (Italy), and others. In addition to his undergraduate teaching, he supervised thirteen completed Ph.D. dissertations. He took part in many scientific meetings all around the world, often being invited as a keynote speaker. He was a member of the board of many scientific associations and journals and the President of the New Israeli Philosophical Association and of the International Association for the Study of Controversies. He held research positions at the universities of Indiana, Stuttgart, Bochum, Technische Univ. Berlin, UNED (Madrid) and the Centre d'Etudes de la Philosophie Moderne (CNRS, Paris), and conducted research on the pragmatics of native languages in the Amazon area. In 1985‚Äì1986 he was a Fellow of the Netherlands Institute of Advanced Studies (Wassenaar) and in 1994‚Äì1995 he was a Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Studies, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the winter term of 2002/3, he was granted the Leibniz Professorship at the Institute for Advanced Studies of Leipzig University (Germany), where he was the first Leibniz scholar to hold this position.http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/philos/dascal/ Research areas In 1995/6 Dascal coordinated in Jerusalem an international research project called \\"Leibniz the Polemicist\\", which was aimed to find new ways to develop an understanding of the importance of debate in shaping knowledge. It was inspired in Leibniz's eclectic and pluralistic approach, according to which knowledge arises out of the synthesis of the \\"grains of truth\\" present in every doctrine, a synthesis that is to be achieved through rational controversy governed by a notion of rationality not reducible to logical deduction and yet not arbitrary. One of the results of this project was the creation of the International Association for the Study of Controversies (IASC, read I ASK). The association has conducted since 1996 yearly workshops and conferences. Another result was a joint German-Israeli research project on the evolution of scientific, philosophical and theological controversies in the 17th and 18th centuries. This project received a three-year grant (1999‚Äì2001) from the German-Israeli Foundation. It was conducted by a team of ten Israeli and German Post-Doctoral and Doctoral researchers, and published four reports. Dascal has published several articles on the topic, and co- founded (along with Gerd Fritz) a new book series called \\"Controversies\\", whose first three volumes were published in 2005. =Leibniz and the history of modern philosophy= Dascal was a Leibniz scholar. He published La S√©miologie de Leibniz (Paris, 1978), Leibniz: Language, Signs and Thought (Amsterdam, 1987), and co-edited Leibniz and Adam (Tel Aviv, 1991) which was selected by the Leibniz Gesellschaft as a special gift for its members. He published many articles on Leibniz, his contemporaries, and his influence. Dascal was co-founder of the Israel Leibniz Association (in Hebrew: Agudat Leibniz Israel) and a member of the Leibniz Association of America and of the Leibniz Gesellschaft. In his earlier work, Dascal focused mainly on Leibniz's philosophy of language, and established the now accepted view that natural languages and other semiotic systems play, for Leibniz, a crucial role in our mental life, and therefore cannot be overlooked in understanding his epistemology. In his last work, Dascal emphasized the fact that, alongside Leibniz's well known and advertised idea of a formal semiotic system, the \\"Universal Characteristic\\", which would be the ideal tool for human cognition, based on a strictly deductive or \\"calculation\\" model of rationality, Leibniz was also concerned with those aspects of rational thought and action which were not accountable for in terms of such a model. Accordingly, he developed a model of what came to be known later as \\"soft\\" rationality. Dascal conducted intensive research on this rather underestimated aspect of Leibniz's rationalism. =Philosophy of language, pragmatics and cognitive science= In the philosophy of language, Dascal's work focused on the theory of language use, i.e., pragmatics. He contributed both to sociopragmatics and to psychopragmatics (a concept he created), Marcelo Dascal, Ph.D. Retrieved on 5 Feb 2018 as well as securing a proper philosophical foundation for these two branches and for their distinction from other components of a theory of meaning. His contributions to the cognitive sciences are closely related with his work on the mental use of language. He published Pragmatics and the Philosophy of Mind (Amsterdam, 1983), and edited the relevant volume of the Enciclopedia IberoAmericana de Filosofia, (Madrid, 1999) and Misunderstanding (a special issue of the Journal of Pragmatics, 1999). He also co-edited the trilingual, two volume, two-thousand page Philosophy of Language: A Handbook of Contemporary Research (Berlin, 1992, 1995), and, more recently; Negotiation and Power in Dialogic Interaction. A Portuguese translation of his book Interpretation and Understanding (2003) was published in 2006. In order to foster the study of the relationship between the use of language (and other semiotic systems) and cognition (and other kinds of mental life) Dascal founded and edited the interdisciplinary journal Pragmatics & Cognition (Amsterdam). Since 2005, the journal publishes an annual Special Issue devoted to Cognition & Technology. Personal life He lived in Israel since 1965. He was married to Varda. They had 3 children - Hagit, Shlomit and Tamar and eight grandchildren - Adi, Lior, Ohad, Noga, Jonathan, Gilead, Almog, and Naomi. .

Concrete landscape curbing (or concrete landscape bordering) is an alternative to plastic or metal landscape edging. Landscape curbing is made with various elements of concrete depending on the climate where it is being used. Concrete landscape curbing has become more popular over the last decade with suppliers offering a variety of styling options. Concrete landscape curbing or 'Stamped Concrete Edging' has been installed in every climate in the United States and throughout the world. It is usually installed using a specialized equipment that is expensive and takes a skilled and experienced person to operate. The equipment most often utilized in landscape curbing is based on a design that originated in Australia around the 1970s. Due to the need of professional installation, concrete landscape curbing is usually utilized as a complete system to create a permanent border. Concrete landscape curbing can be used to highlight and emphasize a flowerbed or other landscaping area. Various colors and styles are available and the final look achieved will vary from installer to installer based on their level of training and experience. A lawn mower wheel can be run on the curbing which helps eliminate the need for edging where a curb is installed. Because of its weight and depth in the ground, the concrete landscape curbing border acts as a root barrier, and is more elegant looking and will last for years.

The French had annexed the region in 1795 and control of the region was officially ceded to the French after the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797. The revolt is considered part of the French Revolutionary Wars. Motivations for war After the Southern Netherlands was annexed by France, the French revolutionaries began to implement their policies regarding the Catholic Church. The Civil Constitution of the Clergy required that priests take an oath of allegiance to the state. Priests who refused such an oath (non-juring priests) were considered to be enemies of the state and could be removed from their positions and homes. Additionally, in early 1798, the French Council of Five Hundred passed a law requiring compulsory military service. This law ordered the conscription of men between the ages of 20 and 25 in all French territories. General conscription was an innovation and was met with anger by the men who were forced into service.Trausch (2002), p. 205 By region =Flanders= The majority of the conflict during the Peasants' War occurred in Flanders (Lys and Scheldt d√©partements) and Brabant (Deux-N√®thes and Dyle d√©partements). Referred to as the Boerenkrijg, it is referenced by some historians as a Belgian national revolt, and an indication of a desire for independence by Belgium. Episode from the Peasants' War by Th√©ophile Lybaert In Flanders the revolt was somewhat organized, with the people seeking aid from foreign nations such as Great Britain and Prussia. The revolution began on 12 October 1798, with peasants taking up arms against the French in Overmere. Initially the rebellion was somewhat successful, however, lacking proper arms and training it was crushed less than two months later, on 5 December, in Hasselt. An estimated 5,000‚Äì10,000 people were killed during the uprising. Additionally, there were 170 executions of the leaders of the rebellion.Orts 1863, p. 211 =Luxembourg= In Luxembourg (For√™ts d√©partement), the revolt was called Kl√´ppelkrich. This revolt quickly spread, consuming most of West Eifel.Kreins (2003), p. 66 The primary combatants in Luxembourg were the peasantry. The middle and upper classes were not driven to revolt as the anti-clericalism and the modernisation brought by the French Revolution were somewhat beneficial to them. Lacking both financial support from the middle classes, and proper military training, the peasants were quickly put down by the French occupation force. Ninety-four insurgents were tried and of those, 42 were executed. In later culture * De Boerenkrijg: an 1853 novel by Hendrik Conscience * Episodes of the war were depicted by the 19th century Belgian artist and sculptor Constantin Meunier. The war has been romanticized in some cases as a proper Belgian revolution, as it was a major uprising fighting for independence from external rule.

White root disease. Agricultural Bulletin of the Straits and Federated Malay States Vol. 3: 173. It belongs to the order Basidiomycete, and in the family Polyporaceae.

Comparative study for detecting Rigidoporus lignosus on rubber trees. Crop Protection, 21, 461‚Äì466. It is the most destructive root disease in rubber plantations in Sri Lanka and many other rubber growing countries. White root rot has now become the most threatening root disease of the rubber tree in both Asian and African continents, which supply 98% of the natural rubber to the world market. In Indonesia alone, the affected area is more than 80,000 ha. As a whole 5‚Äì10% of the cultivated lands are in bare patches due to this deadly disease. International Rubber Research and Development Board survey indicates that this disease is described as \\"severe\\" in C√¥te d'Ivoire, Nigeria and Sri Lanka, and as a significant, endemic problem in Gabon, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. The causative agent (Rigidoporus lignosus) persists on dead or live root debris for a long time, while causing new infections on healthy plants. This fungus has a wide host range (more than 100 woody species in the Ivory Coast have been recorded as being susceptible) and causes the greatest losses in plantations of H. brasiliensis and, to a lesser extent, of teak (Tectona grandis L.).Jayasuriya, K. E. and Thennakoonm, B. I. (2007). Biological control of Rigidoporus microporus, the cause of white root disease in rubber. Cey. J. Sci. (Bio. Sci.). 36 (1): 9‚Äì16. The fungus forms many white, somewhat flattened mycelia strands 1‚Äì2 mm thick that grow on and adhere strongly to the surface of the root bark. These rhizomorphs grow rapidly and may extend several meters through the soil in the absence of any woody substrate. Thus, healthy rubber trees can be infected by free rhizomorphs growing from stumps or infected woody debris buried in the ground as well as by roots contacting those of a diseased neighboring tree. Internal progression of the fungus in root tissues lags well behind the front of epiphytic growth of the mycelium on the root. In this respect, the mode of development of R. lignosus is characteristic of an ectotrophic growth habit. After rhizomorphs infect the roots, the fungus preferentially penetrates the taproot, deep in the soil. First, however, the rhizomorphs must change morphogenetically into infectious hyphae, characterized by degrading extracellular enzymes able to decay the wood.Boisson, C. (1972). Etude de la formation du rhizomorphe du Leptoporus lignosus (Kl.) Heim: Le d√©terminisme de l‚Äôagr√©gation des filaments en palmettes. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris Ser. D 274:2481-2484. This mechanism is strictly regulated by conditions of partial anoxia in the soil, at a depth determined by whether the texture is sandy or clayey. Wood colonization inside the taproot spreads up to the collar and to other portions of the root system. A controlled and effective method for artificially infecting young Hevea plants has been developed by reproducing the conditions of soil anoxia in the greenhouse.Nandris, D.; Nicole, M. and Geiger, J. P. (1983). Inoculations of young plants of Hevea brasiliensis by Rigidoporus lignosus and Phellinus noxius. Eur. J. For. Pathol. 13:65-76. In contrast with the pale pinkish ‚Äì yellow colour of healthy root tissues, freshly colonized wood tissues are brownish red. This coloration fades along a gradient from the progression front of the parasite toward the tissues colonized earlier, where the wood is particularly friable. R. lignosus causes a white rot of the wood characterized by degradation of lignin in the cell walls. The orange-yellow sporophores form mainly during the rainy season at the base of trees heavily attacked by the fungus. The bracket form is most common, but a resupinate form also exists. These sporophores produce a large number of basidiospores, even during the dry season, but seem to have a limited role in disseminating the disease. This has been one of the most controversial points in the biology of R. lignosus since the beginning of this century.Alston, R. A. (1953). Annual reports, 1949-1951, Pathological Division, Rubber Research Institute of Malaya.Pichel, R. J. (1956). Les pourridi√©s de l‚ÄôH√©v√©a dans le cuvette congolaise. INEAC Ser. Tech. 49.480 pp. The spores are viable, but there is agreement now that the probability of a spore germinating in situ on a receptive substrate is extremely low.John, K. P. (1965). Some observations on spore infection of Hevea stumps by Fomes lignosus (Kl.) Bres. J. Rubber Res. Inst. Malaya. 19:17-21. In Hevea plantations established immediately after a forest is cleared, mycelia filaments of R. lignosus cause infection (Pichel, 1956). In second plantings, however, spores can constitute inoculum for infecting the stump surfaces of old rubber trees remaining between the planting rows.

The Sayan mountains were also included in their territory at different times. The Kyrgyz Khaganate existed from 550 to 1219 CE; in 840, it took over the leadership of the Turkic Khaganate from the Uyghurs, expanding the state from the Yenisei territories into the Central Asia and Tarim Basin. The Yenisei Kyrgyz mass migration to the Jeti-su resulted in the formation of the modern Kyrgyz Republic land of the modern-day Kyrgyz.

(August 2018). \\"The Ethnogonic Tales of the T√ºrks\\". The Medieval History Journal, 21(2): 302. By the fall of the Gokturk Empire in the eighth century CE, the Yenisei Kirghiz had established their own thriving state based on the Gokturk model. They had adopted the Orkhon script of the G√∂kt√ºrks and established trading ties with China and the Abbasid Caliphate in Central Asia and Middle East. The Kyrgyz Khagans of the Yenisei Kyrgyz Khaganate claimed descent from the Chinese general Li Ling, grandson of the famous Han Dynasty general Li Guang. Li Ling was captured by the Xiongnu and defected in the first century BCE and since the Tang royal Li family also claimed descent from Li Guang, the Kirghiz Khagan was therefore recognized as a member of the Tang Imperial family. Emperor Zhongzong of Tang had said to them that \\"Your nation and Ours are of the same ancestral clan (Zong). You are not like other foreigners.\\" In 758, the Uyghurs killed the Kirghiz Khan and the Kirghiz came under the rule of the Uyghur Khaganate. However, the Yenisei Kyrghyz spent much of their time in a state of rebellion. In 840 they succeeded in sacking the Uyghur capital, Ordu-Baliq in Mongolia's Orkhon Valley and driving the Uyghurs out of Mongolia entirely. On February 13 843 at \\"Kill the Foreigners\\" Mountain, the Tang Chinese inflicted a devastating defeat upon the Uyghur Qaghan's forces. But rather than replace the Uyghurs as the lords of Mongolia, the Yenisei Kirghiz continued to live in their traditional homeland and exist as they had for centuries. The defeat and collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate triggered a massive migration of Uyghurs from Mongolia into Turfan, Kumul and Gansu where they founded the Kingdom of Qocho and Gansu Uyghur Kingdom. When Genghis Khan came to power in the early 13th century, the Yenisei Kirghiz submitted peacefully to him and were absorbed into his Mongol Empire, putting an end to their independent state. During the time of the Mongol Empire, the territory of the Yenisei Kirghiz in Northern Mongolia was turned into an agricultural colony called Kem-Kemchik. Kublai Khan, who founded the Yuan Dynasty, also sent Mongolian and Chinese officials (along with colonists) to serve as judges in the Kyrgyz and Tuva regions. Some of the Yenisei Kirghiz were relocated into the Dzungar Khanate by the Dzungars. In 1761, after the Dzungars were defeated by the Qing, some √ñelet, a tribe of Oirat-speaking Dzungars, were deported to Nonni basin in Northeastern China (Manchuria) and a group of Yenisei Kirghiz were also deported along with the √ñelet. The Kirghiz moved to northeastern China became known as the Fuyu Kyrgyz, but they have now mostly merged with the Mongol and Chinese population.Tchoroev (Chorotegin) 2003, p. 110.Pozzi & Janhunen & Weiers 2006, p. 113. The descendants of the Yenisei Kirghiz today are the Kyrgyz, Khakas and Altai peoples. Ethnicity and language Yenisei Kyrgyz artefacts Yenisei Kyrgyz tableware and altar Yenisei Kyrgyz agricultural tools Elegest inscription Culturally and linguistically, the Yenisei Kirghiz were Turkic. According to the Tang Huiyao (961 CE), which very likely comes from the Xu Huiyao that Yang Shaofu and others completed in 852, citing Protector General of Anxi Ge Jiayun, the Kirghiz were described as having primarily Caucasian features, with some having East Asian features. From Xiajiasi Èª†ÊàõÊñØ, Soviet scientists reconstructed the ethnonym Khakass.Lee & Kuang (2017) \\"A Comparative Analysis of Chinese Historical Sources and Y-DNA Studies with Regard to the Early and Medieval Turkic Peoples\\", Inner Asia 19. p. 216 of 197-239 Edwin G. Pulleyblank surmises that \\"red face and yellow head\\" meaning was possibly a folk etymology provided by an interpreter who explained the ethnonym based on Turkic q√Øz√Øl ~ qizqil, meaning 'red'.Pulleyblank, Edwin G. \\"The Name of the Kirghiz\\" in Central Asiatic Journal, Vol. 34, No. 1/2 (1990). Harrassowitz Verlag. page 105 of 98-108. Medieval Muslim writers described contemporary Turks as \\"broad faced people with small eyes\\". and noted that Tibetans and Turks resembled each other so much that Arabs and Persians could not tell the difference between those two groups. Meanwhile, on Western Turkic coins \\" the faces of the governor and governess are clearly mongoloid (a roundish face, narrow eyes), and the portrait have definite old T√ºrk features (long hair, absence of headdress of the governor, a tricorn headdress of the governess)\\". Considering those contemporary descriptions of Turks as possesssed Asiatic phenotypes, the description of the Kirghiz as tall, blue-eyed blonds excited the early interest of scholars, who assumed that Kyrgyz might not have originally been Turkic in language. Golden considered Kyrghyzes to be Palaeo-Siberians Turkicized under Turkic leadership.Golden, Peter B. ‚ÄúThe Stateless Nomads of Central Eurasia‚Äù, in Empires and Exchanges in Eurasian Late Antiquity Edited by DiCosmo, Maas. p. 347-348. doi: https://doi.org/10.1017/9781316146040.024 Ligeti cited the opinions of various scholars who had proposed to see them as Germanic, Slav, or Ket, while he himself, following Castr√©n and Schott, favoured a Samoyed origin on the basis of an etymology for a supposed Kirghiz word qa≈°a or qa≈° for \\"iron\\". However Pulleyblank argued: American Turkologist Michael Drompp adheres to the same opinion: Lifestyle The Yenisei Kirghiz had a mixed economy based on traditional nomadic animal breeding (mostly horses and cattle) and agriculture. According to Chinese records, they grew Himalayan rye, barley, millet, and wheat. They were also skilled iron workers, jewelry makers, potters, and weavers. Their homes were traditional nomadic tents and, in the agricultural areas, wood and bark huts. Their farming settlements were protected by log palisades. The resources of their forested homeland (mainly fur) allowed the Yenisei Kirghiz to become prosperous merchants as well. They maintained trading ties with China, Tibet, the Abbasid Caliphate of the Middle east, and many local tribes. Kirghiz horses were also renowned for their large size and speed. The tenth-century Persian text Hudud al-'alam described the Kirgiz as people who \\"venerate the Fire and burn the dead\\", and that they were nomads who hunted. Etymology and names The trisyllabic forms with Chinese -sz for Turkic final -z appear only from the end of 8th century onward. Before that time we have a series of Chinese transcriptions referring to the same people and stretching back to the 2nd century BCE, which end either in -n or -t: *Gekun (EMC kŒ≠rjk kw…ôn), 2nd century BCE. Shiji 110, Hanshu 94a. *Jiankun (EMC khŒ≠n kw…ôn), 1st century BCE onward. Hanshu 70. *Qigu (EMC kŒ≠t kw…ôt), 6th century. Zhoushu 50. *Hegu (EMC Œ≥…ôt kw…ôt), 6th century. Suishu 84. *Jiegu (EMC kŒ≠t kw…ôt), 6th‚Äì8th century. Tongdian 200, Old Book of Tang 194b, and Tang Huiyao 100. Neither -n nor -t provides a good equivalent for -z. The most serious attempt to explain these forms seems still to be that of Paul Pelliot in 1920. Pelliot suggested that Middle Chinese -t stands for Turkic -z, which would be quite unusual and would need supporting evidence, but then his references to Mongol plurals in -t suggest that he thinks that the name of the Kirghiz, like that of the Turks, first became known to the Chinese through Mongol speaking intermediaries. There is still less plausibility in the suggestion that the Kirghiz, who first became known as a people conquered by that Xiongnu and then re-emerged associated with other Turkic peoples in the 6th century, should have had Mongol style suffixes attached to all the various forms of their name that were transcribed into Chinese up to the 9th century. The change of r to z in Turkic which is implied by the Chinese forms of the name Kirghiz should not give any comfort to those who want to explain Mongolian and Tungusic cognates with r as Turkic loanwords. The peoples mentioned in sources of the Han period that can be identified as Turkic was Dingling (later Tiele, out of whom the Uyghurs emerged), the Jiankun (later Kirghiz), the Xinli (later Sir/Xue), and possibly also the Hujie or Wujie, were all, at that period, north and west of the Xiongnu in general area where we find the Kirghiz at the beginning of Tang.

His fame rests principally on his erudition abilities. Biography Biner entered the Society of Jesus in 1715 and received the usual training of its members. He was later professor of canon law in the universities of Ingolstadt, Dillingen and Innsbruck. He entered zealously into all the controversies with the sectaries of his time, especially with the Swiss Protestants. As a consequence, all his works have a polemical tinge. In 1739 appeared his Catholische Anmerkung √ºber die neueste uncatholische Controvers-Schreiber, directed against certain opponents in Z√ºrich. This was followed in 1744 by Indifferentismus, a treatise on religious indifference and liberalism in dogmatic teaching. Biner published Heiligkeit der Kirche in 1750, discussing the marks of the \\"true Church\\" and giving sketches of eminent Catholics. The best of his polemical works is De Summ√¢ Trinitate, Fide Catholic√¢ et Hierarchi√¢ Ecclesiastic√¢. It appeared in 1765 and shows him at his best as a theologian and canonist. His last controversial treatise, which appeared the same year and was published like all the others at Vienna, is entitled: Kurzer Begriff der heutigen Glaubenstreitigkeiten. It is an examination and refutation of various Protestant confessions of faith. Biner's chief work of a purely canonical character is Dissertationes juridic√¶ de beneficiis ecclesiasticis (Innsbruck, 1746). His masterpiece is the Apparatus erudictionis ad jurisprudentiam ecclesiasticam. The work, despite its title, is not restricted to canon law, but is also historical, polemical, and theological. It was published at Vienna in eight quarto volumes from 1754 to 1766. It is a work of vast erudition and a storehouse of history and canon law. Dividing his material by centuries, Biner treats of the various species of law, of the history of the church councils, of the political and religious vicissitudes of the various nations, of treaties and concordats, etc. Interspersed in the work are many valuable excursuses on Jansenism, Probabilism, Public Penance, Origin of Imperial Electors, etc. However the work is rendered less valuable for students by a nonsystematic arrangement of material and the want of an index. The vastness of the knowledge which Biner displays, however, has received praise even from his opponents. He wrote many other works besides those mentioned, which may be found in De Backer and Sommervogel, cited below.

It was built in 1832 by Mukhtiyar (equivalent to Prime Minister) Bhimsen Thapa under the commission of Queen Lalit Tripurasundari and was a part of the architecture of Kathmandu recognized by UNESCO. The tower had a spiral staircase containing 213 steps. The eighth floor held a circular balcony for observers that provided a panoramic view of the Kathmandu valley. It also had a bronze mast on the roof. Most of the tower collapsed in the 25 April 2015 Nepal earthquake, but the base remains. Sixty bodies were found in the rubble. Reconstruction of the tower commenced in October 2018. History alt= Dharahara in Kathmandu was the tallest building in Nepal and the second such tower built by Bhimsen Thapa. The first tower was built eight years earlier in 1824 and was eleven storeys high, two storeys taller than the Dharahara. Dharahara is said to have been built for Queen Tripurasundari, who was the niece of Bhimsen Thapa. During the earthquake of 1834, both towers survived,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_ScCEK05fQ but the first of Bhimsen's two towers suffered severe damage. A century later, on 15 January 1934, another earthquake completely destroyed the first tower, and only two of the nine storeys of the second tower remained. The then Prime Minister of Nepal, Juddha Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana, subsequently carried out renovation work of the Dharahara tower to fully restore it. After the original Bhimsen Tower was destroyed, Queen Lalit Tripurasundari's tower came to be known as Bhimsen Stambha (). Dharahara was constructed for military usage as a watchtower. When incidents of national importance occurred, bugles were blown from the top floor of the tower. This was the signal for soldiers to assemble. This tradition of bugle trumpeting continued until the collapse of the tower.  2015 earthquake and reconstruction  thumb On 25 April 2015, another earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 7.8 (), hit Kathmandu and its surrounding region, leading to the collapse of the tower. The earthquake's epicenter was approximately east-southeast of Lamjung, Nepal. The structure collapsed and only its base survived. In February 2016, the government decided to rebuild the tower, and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and his cabinet ministers contributed one month's salary to the rebuilding. A fund called \\"I will construct Dharahara\\" was also established to collect money for the reconstruction. According to Sushil Gyawali, chief executive of the National Reconstruction Agency, the new tower will be earthquake-resistant. The foundation stone of the new tower was laid down on 27 December 2018. The reconstruction of Dharahara, which will now be a high-tech structure, started on 10 October 2018. The new Dharahara would look similar to the old one, however, it would be equipped with modern amenities. As per the reconstruction plan, the new Dharahara would be 245 ft. tall with 11-storeys, however, it would be of 21-storeys from the inside. The new structure will have a mini exhibition theatre on the 18th floor, a mint museum, a ‚ÄòGreen Park‚Äô, a musical fountain, vehicle parking area, a souvenir shop and a food court, among other attractions. Architecture The architecture of Dharahara was designed in both Mughal and European style. It resembled an Islamic minaret. The statue of Hindu deity Shiva was placed on the top of the tower. Before collapse The tower was a major tourist attraction and was open to the public from 2005 until its collapse in 2015. The management of Dharahara when it was standing came under severe scrutiny from locals and tourists. The Heritage Department of Kathmandu Metropolitan City came under severe criticism for its lack of effort to protect the heritage site.

See \\"Execution\\". prints created between 1810 and 1820 by the Spanish painter and printmaker Francisco Goya (1746‚Äì1828). Although Goya did not make known his intention when creating the plates, art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 Dos de Mayo Uprising, the subsequent Peninsular War of 1808‚Äì1814 and the setbacks to the liberal cause following the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in 1814. During the conflicts between Napoleon's French Empire and Spain, Goya retained his position as first court painter to the Spanish crown and continued to produce portraits of the Spanish and French rulers.Wilson-Bareau, 45 Although deeply affected by the war, he kept private his thoughts on the art he produced in response to the conflict and its aftermath.Sayre, 129 He was in poor health and almost deaf when, at 62, he began work on the prints.

In total over a thousand sets have been printed, though later ones are of lower quality, and most print room collections have at least some of the set. The name by which the series is known today is not Goya's own. His handwritten title on an album of proofs given to a friend reads: Fatal consequences of Spain's bloody war with Bonaparte, and other emphatic caprices (Spanish: Fatales consequencias de la sangrienta guerra en Espa√±a con Buonaparte, Y otros caprichos enf√°ticos).Wilson-Bareau, 48‚Äì49. This is the title of the album given to Juan Agust√≠n Ce√°n Berm√∫dez, written by Goya himself (illustrated Wilson-Bareau, 44), although the series is always referred to by the title given to the published set. Aside from the titles or captions given to each print, these are Goya's only known words on the series. With these works, he breaks from a number of painterly traditions. He rejects the bombastic heroics of most previous Spanish war art to show the effect of conflict on individuals. In addition he abandons colour in favour of a more direct truth he found in shadow and shade. Plate 4: Las mujeres dan valor (The women are courageous). A struggle between civilians and soldiers The series was produced using a variety of intaglio printmaking techniques, mainly etching for the line work and aquatint for the tonal areas, but also engraving and drypoint. As with many other Goya prints, they are sometimes referred to as aquatints, but more often as etchings. The series is usually considered in three groups which broadly mirror the order of their creation. The first 47 focus on incidents from the war and show the consequences of the conflict on individual soldiers and civilians. The middle series (plates 48 to 64) record the effects of the famine that hit Madrid in 1811‚Äì12, before the city was liberated from the French. The final 17 reflect the bitter disappointment of liberals when the restored Bourbon monarchy, encouraged by the Catholic hierarchy, rejected the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and opposed both state and religious reform. Goya's scenes of atrocities, starvation, degradation and humiliation have been described as the \\"prodigious flowering of rage\\".Connell, 175 The serial nature in which the plates unfold has led some to see the images as similar in nature to photography.Bryant, Clifton. \\"Handbook of death & dying, Volumes 1‚Äì2\\".

Historical background Napoleon I of France declared himself First Consul of the French Republic on 18 February 1799, and was crowned Emperor in 1804. Because Spain controlled access to the Mediterranean, it was politically and strategically important to the French. The reigning Spanish sovereign, Charles IV, was internationally regarded as ineffectual,Connell, 145‚Äì146 and his position at the time was threatened by his pro-British heir, Crown Prince Ferdinand. Napoleon took advantage of Charles's weak standing by suggesting the two nations conquer Portugal‚Äîthe spoils to be divided equally between France, Spain and the Spanish Prime Minister, Manuel de Godoy, who would take the title \\"Prince of the Algarve\\". Seduced by the French offer, Godoy accepted, failing to detect the true motivations of either Napoleon or Ferdinand, who both intended to use the invasion as a ploy, to seize power in Spain.

In 1808, a popular uprising‚Äîincited by Ferdinand's supporters‚Äîsaw Godoy captured and left Charles with no choice but to abdicate; he did so on 19 March 1808, allowing his son to ascend the throne as Ferdinand VII.

They decided that Napoleon's brother, Joseph Bonaparte, should be king.Licht, 109 Under a pretext of mediation, Napoleon summoned Charles and Ferdinand to Bayonne, France, where they were coerced into relinquishing their rights to the throne in favour of Joseph. alt=Half-length portrait of Wellington turned slightly to the left, wearing 18th-century British military officers uniform and many decorations, including several ribbons across his chest and a large star. Like other Spanish liberals, Goya was left in a difficult position after the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced‚Äîand the differences far more entrenched‚Äîfollowing the eventual withdrawal of the French.Shaw, 482 Several of Goya's friends, including the poets Juan Mel√©ndez Vald√©s and Leandro Fern√°ndez de Morat√≠n, were overt : the supporters (or collaborators, in the view of many) of Joseph Bonaparte. He maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary. However, Goya had an instinctive dislike of authority,Clark, 129 and witnessed first-hand the subjugation of his countrymen by French troops.That Goya had first-hand knowledge of events depicted in The Disasters of War is implied by the title of the print I saw it. During these years he painted little aside from portraits of figures from all parties, including an allegorical painting of Joseph Bonaparte in 1810, Wellington from 1812 to 1814, and French and Spanish generals.Both the Bonaparte allegory and Wellington's medals and orders required updating soon after to reflect the changing situation‚ÄîWilson-Bareau, 45, and, for Wellington, Neil MacLaren, revised Allan Braham, The Spanish School, National Gallery Catalogues. National Gallery London, 1970. 16‚Äì20. Meanwhile, Goya was working on drawings that would form the basis for The Disasters of War. He visited many battle sites around Madrid to witness the Spanish resistance.

Plates Art historians broadly agree that The Disasters of War is divided into three thematic groupings‚Äîwar, famine, and political and cultural allegories. This sequence broadly reflects the order in which the plates were created. Few of the plates or drawings are dated; instead, their chronology has been established by identifying specific incidents to which the plates refer,Hughes (2004), 273 and the different batches of plates used, which allow sequential groups to be divined. For the most part, Goya's numbering agrees with these other methods.Wilson-Bareau, 49‚Äì51, 57‚Äì99 However, there are several exceptions. For example, plate 1 was among the last to be completed, after the end of the war.Wilson-Bareau, 49‚Äì59, discusses the sequences of subjects and dates of creation in detail. For plate 1, see 51‚Äì52. In the early plates of the war grouping, Goya's sympathies appear to lie with the Spanish defenders. These images typically show patriots facing hulking, anonymous invaders who treat them with fierce cruelty. As the series progresses, the distinction between the Spanish and the imperialists becomes ambiguous. In other plates, it is difficult to tell to which camp the distorted and disfigured corpses belong. Some of the titles deliberately question the intentions of both sides; for example, Con razon √≥ sin ella can mean with or without reason, rightly or wrongly, or for something or for nothing. Critic Philip Shaw notes that the ambiguity is still present in the final group of plates, saying there is no distinction between the \\"heroic defenders of the Fatherland and the barbaric supporters of the old regime\\". There have been a variety of English translations offered for the plate titles. In many instances, the satirical and often sardonic ambiguity and play on Spanish proverbs found in Goya's carefully worded original titles is lost. =War= Plates 1 to 47 consist mainly of realistic depictions of the horrors of the war fought against the French. Most portray the aftermath of battle; they include mutilated torsos and limbs mounted on trees, like \\"fragments of marble sculpture\\". Both French and Spanish troops tortured and mutilated captives; evidence of such acts is minutely detailed across a number of Goya's plates.Robinson, Maisah. \\"Review of Francisco Goya's Disasters of War\\". Associated Press, 2006. Retrieved 28 August 2009. Civilian death is also captured in detail. Spanish women were commonly victims of assault and rape. Civilians often followed armies to battle scenes. If their side won, women and children would search the battlefield for their husbands, fathers and sons. If they lost, they fled in fear of being raped or murdered.Connell, 174 In plate 9, No quieren (They do not want to), an elderly woman is shown wielding a knife in defence of a young woman who is being assaulted by a soldier. Plate 1: Tristes presentimientos de lo que ha de acontecer (Gloomy presentiments of what must come to pass). This plate was from one of the last groups to be created. The group begins with Tristes presentimientos de lo que ha de acontecer (Gloomy presentiments of what must come to pass), in which a man kneels in the darkness with outstretched arms. The following plates describe combat with the French, who‚Äîaccording to art critic Vivien Raynor‚Äîare depicted \\"rather like Cossacks, bayoneting civilians\\", while Spanish civilians are shown \\"poleaxing the French.\\"Raynor, Vivien. \\"Goya's 'Disasters of War': Grisly Indictment of Humanity\\". New York Times, 25 February 1990. Retrieved 29 August 2009. Plates 31 to 39 focus on atrocities and were produced on the same batch of plates as the famine group.Wilson-Bareau, 50‚Äì51 Others are based on drawings Goya had completed in his Sketchbook-journal, in studies where he examined the theme of the grotesque body in relation to the iconography of the tortured or martyred one. In his India ink wash drawing We cannot look at this (1814‚Äì24), he examined the idea of a humiliated inverted body with pathos and tragedy, as he did to comical effect in The Straw Mannequin (1791‚Äì92).Stoichita and Coderch, 88‚Äì89 Unlike most earlier Spanish art, Goya's rejects the ideals of heroic dignity. He refuses to focus on individual participants; though he drew from many classic art sources, his works pointedly portray the protagonists as anonymous casualties, rather than known patriots.Stoichita and Coderch, 95 The exception is plate 7, Que valor! (What courage!), which depicts Agustina de Arag√≥n (1786‚Äì1857), the heroine of Zaragoza, who brought food to the cannoneers at the city defensive walls during the siege in which 54,000Wilson, Charles M. Liberty Or Death!. Bloomington, Indiana: Trafford Publishing, 2008. 67. Spaniards died. When all the cannoneers had been killed, Agustina manned and fired the cannons herself.Connell, 162 Although it is agreed that Goya could not have witnessed this incident, Robert Hughes believes it may have been his visit to Zaragoza in the lull between the first and second phases of the siege that inspired him to produce the series.Hughes (2004), 287‚Äì288 =Famine= The second group, plates 48 to 64, detail the effects of the famine which ravaged Madrid from August 1811 until after Wellington's armies liberated the city in August 1812. Starvation killed 20,000 people in the city that year.Hughes (2004), 297‚Äì299; Wilson-Bareau, 50‚Äì51 In these plates, Goya's focus is directed away from the generalised scenes of slaughter of anonymous, unaligned people in unnamed regions of Spain; he turns towards a specific horror unfolding in Madrid. The famine was a result of many factors. For example, French invaders and Spanish guerrillas and bandits blocked paths and roads into the city, hampering the provision of food. Goya does not focus on the reasons for the shortage, nor does he apportion blame to any one party. Instead, he is concerned only with its effect on the population.Hughes (2004), 297 Although the images in the group were based on the experience of Madrid, none of the scenes depict specific events, and there are no identifiable buildings to place the scenes. Goya's focus is on the darkened masses of dead and barely alive bodies, men carrying corpses of women, and bereaved children mourning for lost parents.Hughes (2004), 297‚Äì298 Hughes believes plate 50, Madre infeliz! (Unhappy mother!), to be the most powerful and poignant of the group. He suggests that the space between the small girl sobbing and the corpse of her mother represents \\"a darkness that seems to be the very essence of loss and orphanhood\\".Hughes (2004), 299 This group of plates was probably completed by early 1814.Wilson-Bareau, 51 A scarcity of materials during the famine may have accounted for the freer application of aquatint in these prints; Goya was sometimes forced to use defective plates or reuse old plates after they were burnished. =Bourbons and clergy= Plates 65 to 82 were named \\"caprichos enf√°ticos\\" (\\"emphatic caprices\\") in the original series title.\\"Caprichos enf√°ticos\\" is difficult to translate; in the 18th century language of rhetoric, \\"emphatic\\" suggests that these prints \\"make a point or give a warning by insinuation rather than by direct statement\\"‚ÄîWilson-Bareau, 59, quoting from an undisclosed source. Wilson-Bareau adds that \\"enf√°ticos\\" is also often translated as \\"striking\\". In talking about art, \\"Caprice\\", usually found today as the original Italian capriccio, normally suggests light-hearted fantasy, which does not characterise these prints or Los Caprichos Completed between 1813 and 1820 and spanning Ferdinand VII's fall and return to power, they consist of allegorical scenes that critique post-war Spanish politics, including the Inquisition and the then-common judicial practice of torture. Although peace was welcomed, it produced a political environment that was in ways more repressive than before. The new regime stifled the hopes of liberals such as Goya, who used the term \\"fatal consequences\\" to describe the situation in his title for the series.Wilson-Bareau, 57‚Äì60 Cannizzo, Stephanie. \\"Goya: The Disasters of War \\". Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, 2007. Retrieved 28 August 2009. Hughes refers to the group as the \\"disasters of peace\\". alt=A woman lies dead, demons dance, spectres watch and celebrate; men pray and wring their hands in grief; while shafts of powerful light emanate and shine from her corpse/body or will she rise to live again, perhaps she is not quite dead yet. After the six years of absolutism that followed Ferdinand's return to the throne on 1 January 1820, Rafael del Riego initiated an army revolt with the intent of restoring the 1812 Constitution. By March, the king was forced to agree, but by September 1823, after an unstable period, a French invasion supported by an alliance of the major powers had removed the constitutional government. The last prints were probably not completed until after the Constitution was restored, though certainly before Goya left Spain in May 1824. Their balance of optimism and cynicism makes it difficult to relate them directly to particular moments in these rapidly moving events.Wilson-Bareau, 57‚Äì8 Many of these images return to the savage burlesque style seen in Goya's earlier Caprichos. Plate 75 Far√°ndula de charlatanes (Troupe of charlatans) shows a priest with a parrot's head performing before an audience of donkeys and monkeys. In plate 77, a pope walking a tightrope was \\"prudently reduced\\" to a cardinal or bishop in the print published in 1863.Wilson-Bareau, 59 Some prints showing animal scenes seem to draw from a satirical verse fable by Giovanni Battista Casti, published in Italian in 1802; the Animal Farm of its day. In plate 74, the wolf, representing a minister, quotes from the fable‚Äî\\"Miserable humanity, the fault is thine\\"‚Äîand signs with Casti's name. The print \\"lays the blame for their rulers' barbarity on the victims' own acceptance of it\\".Wilson-Bareau, 59. See also plate 77 in the gallery at bottom. alt=Three elderly men strain under the weight of the church statue that they carry upon their shoulders. They appear to slowly flee, with others also carrying church relics in the distance from danger and destruction A number of plates in this group reveal a scepticism towards idolatry of religious images. There are instances in the group where early Christian iconography, in particular statues and processional images, are mocked and denigrated. Plate 67, Esta no lo es menos (This is no less curious), shows two statues carried by two stooped members of clergy. One statue is recognisable as the \\"Virgin of Solitude\\". In Goya's image, the statue is not carried vertically in processional triumph, rather it lies flat and undignified on the backs of the two almost crouched men. Shown horizontal, the object loses its aura, and becomes a mere everyday object. Art critics Victor Stoichita and Anna Maria Coderch wrote, \\"It is in effect a deposed, toppled image, stripped of its powers and its connotations.\\" Goya is making a general statement: that the Church's attempts to support and restore the Bourbons were \\"illusory, since what they proposed was nothing more than the adoration of an empty form\\".Stoichita and Coderch, 90‚Äì92 The published edition of The Disasters of War ends as it begins; with the portrayal of a single, agonized figure. The last two plates show a woman wearing a wreath, intended as a personification of Spain, Truth, or the Constitution of 1812‚Äîwhich Ferdinand had rejected in 1814. In plate 79, Muri√≥ la Verdad (The Truth has died), she lies dead. In plate 80, Si resucitar√°? (Will she live again?), she is shown lying on her back with breasts exposed, bathed in a halo of light before a mob of \\"monks and monsters\\".Wilson-Bareau, 59 (quotation) In plate 82, Esto es lo verdadero (This is the true way), she is again bare-breasted and apparently represents peace and plenty. Here, she lies in front of a peasant.Wilson-Bareau, 59‚Äì60Of the last two prints, Licht writes, \\"[Goya's] otherwise authoritative hand begins to hesitate, and he creates the two weakest plates in the entire series. Therein, perhaps, lies his strength: He cannot delude himself.\\" Licht, 158 Execution Many of Goya's preparatory drawings, mostly in red chalk, have survived and are numbered differently from the published prints.Wilson-Bareau, 49‚Äì50 He produced two albums of proofs‚Äîamong many individual proof impressions‚Äîof which only one is complete.The most important collection of individual proofs was acquired in Spain by Sir William Stirling-Maxwell, 9th Baronet from Valent√≠n Carderera, who probably got them from Goya's grandson. In 1951, they were sold to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Wilson-Bareau, 99. This collection includes a unique unfinished and unpublished print from the first group: Infame provecho (Vile Advantage), Boston MFA Accession number: 51.1697 The full album consists of 85 works, including three small Prisioneros (\\"Prisoners\\") made in 1811 which are not part of the series. Goya gave the copy of the full album, now in the British Museum, to his friend Juan Agust√≠n Ce√°n Berm√∫dez. It contains a title-page inscription in Goya's hand, is signed at the page edges, and has numbers and titles to the prints written by Goya. These were copied on the plates when the published edition was prepared in 1863. By then, 80 had passed from Goya's son, Javier‚Äîwho had stored them in Madrid after his father left Spain‚Äîto the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando (Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando), of which Goya had been director. Comparison of the Ce√°n proof set and the engraved captions reveal changes to the inscriptions in factors such as spelling, punctuation and phrasing. These modifications sometimes affected the accompanying scene's meaning or impact, such as in Plate 36: in all printed editions, the title is given as 'Tampoco' ('Not in this case either'), while in the proof series it is written as 'Tan poco' ('So little').. Numbers 81 and 82 of the series rejoined the others in the Academy in 1870, and were not published until 1957. Spanish National Library web page on the series . Retrieved 14 October 2009 Goya's title for the series in the Ce√°n album, was Fatal consequences of the bloody war in Spain with Bonaparte. Its subsequent shortening to Los Desastres de la Guerra was presumably an allusion to Jacques Callot's series Les mis√®res de la Guerre. Plate 44: Yo lo vi (I saw this) from the published edition, with alt=In the distance the town, people fleeing on horseback and by foot. A woman holding one child in her arm reaches for another who has fallen to the ground; as an army approaches. As the series progressed, Goya evidently began to experience shortages of good quality paper and copper plates, and was forced to take what art historian Juliet Wilson-Bareau calls the \\"drastic step\\" of destroying two etched and aquatinted landscapes, likely from the first years of the century,McDonald, 23. from which very few impressions had been printed. These were cut in half to produce four of The Disasters of Wars prints.Wilson-Bareau, 50 Partly because of the material shortages, the sizes and shapes of the plates vary somewhat, ranging from as small as 142 √ó 168 mm (5.6 √ó 6.6 in) to as large as 163 √ó 260 mm (6.4 √ó 10.2 in).Plates 14 and 24, respectively. See the Spanish National Library website for measurements. Goya completed 56 plates during the war against France, and these are often viewed as eye-witness accounts. A final batch‚Äîincluding plate 1, several in the middle of the series, and the last 17 plates‚Äîare likely to have been produced after the end of the war, when materials were more abundant. The titles of some plates, written beneath each, indicate his presence: I saw this (plate 44) and One can not look (plate 26).Boime, Albert. Art in an Age of Bonapartism, 1800‚Äì1815. The University of Chicago Press, 1990. 307‚Äì308. While it is unclear how much of the conflict Goya witnessed, it is generally accepted that he observed first-hand many of the events recorded in the first two groups. A number of other scenes are known to have been related to him second hand. It is known that he used a sketchbook when visiting battle sites; at his studio, he set to work on copper plate once he had absorbed and assimilated meaning from his sketches. All drawings are from the same paper, and all the copper plates are uniform.Wilson-Bareau, 57 The titles of a number of scenes link pairs or larger groups, even if the scenes themselves are not related. Examples include plates 2 and 3 (With or without reason and The same), 4 and 5 (The women are courageous and And they are fierce), and 9, 10 and 11 (They do not want to, Nor these and Or these). Other plates show scenes from the same story or incident, as in plates 46 and 47 (This is bad and This is how it happened), in which a monk is murdered by French soldiers looting church treasures; a rare sympathetic image of the clergy, who are generally shown to be on the side of oppression and injustice.Fremont-Barnes, Gregory. The Napoleonic wars: the Peninsular War 1807‚Äì1814. Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 2002. 73. Plate 41: Escapan entre las llamas (They escape among the flames). Men and women some carrying each other run into the night, amidst chaos and terror. The Berm√∫dez set is considered \\"uniquely important ... because it shows the series as Goya must have intended to publish it, and the way he intended the plates to be printed\\". There is therefore a distinction between the published edition of 1863, with 80 plates, and the full series in the album, which contains 82 (ignoring the three small Prisioneros). The Berm√∫dez album was borrowed by the Academy for the 1863 edition. The original titles or captions were etched onto the plates, even with Goya's spelling mistakes. One title was changed,The title of plate 69 was altered as \\"apparently ... too nihilistic\\" from Goya's Nada. Ello lo dice to Nada. Ello dir√° (Wilson-Bareau, 57). one plate had work added and, unlike the proofs, the printing was carried out selectively not wiping ink from areas of the surface of the plates, producing \\"surface tone\\", in accordance with mid-century taste.Wilson-Bareau, 46‚Äì49 Goya mostly used the tonal technique of aquatint, in which he became very skilled in producing dramatic contrasts,Wilson Bareau, 12, 32 fully satisfying his needs for tonal effects. Reflecting the mid-19th century taste for a \\"rich overall tone\\", the 1863 edition took the \\"disastrous\\" decision to make considerable use of surface tone, which is not seen in the few early impressions made by Goya himself. Instead of the \\"luminosity and delicacy\\" of these, the later editions \\"provide a dulled and distorted reflection of the artist's intentions\\", according to Juliet Wilson Bareau.Wilson Bareau, 49 The Disasters of War was not published during Goya's lifetime, possibly because he feared political repercussions from Fernando VII's repressive regime.Hughes (2004), 303It has been suggested that Goya numbered the initial set of 56 plates in 1814, during a few months of national optimism following the end of the war, with the intent of publishing them then. However, on 11 May 1814, Fernando VII declared that the war would be forgotten and nullified the constitution, making publication impossible (Sayre, 128‚Äì129). Some art historians suggest that he did not publish because he was sceptical about the use of images for political motives, and instead saw them as a personal meditation and release. Most, however, believe the artist preferred to wait until they could be made public without censorship.Stoichita and Coderch, 91Licht speculates, \\"These plates obviously had to be created by the artist without any further thought about their ultimate purpose. Goya never intended them for publication during his lifetime.\\" (Licht, 128). Wilson-Bareau and Hughes disagree, see Wilson-Bareau p. 59 and passim in chapter 4. A further four editions were published, the last in 1937, so that in total over 1,000 impressions of each print have been printed, though not all of the same quality. As with his other series, later impressions show wear to the aquatint. The 1863 edition had 500 impressions, and editions followed in 1892 (100) before which the plates were probably steel-faced to prevent further wear, 1903 (100), 1906 (275), and 1937. Many sets have been broken up, and most print room collections will have at least some of the set. Examples, especially from later editions, are available on the art market.Spaightwood Galleries accessed October 18, 2009 In 1873, Spanish novelist Antonio de Trueba published the purported reminiscences of Goya's gardener, Isidro, on the genesis of the series. de Trueba claims to have spoken to Isidro in 1836, when the gardener recalled accompanying Goya to the hill of Principe Pio to sketch the victims of the executions of 3 May 1808.\\"As midnight approached, my master said, 'Isidro, take your gun and come with me.' I obeyed him and where do you think we went?‚ÄîTo that hill where the bodies of those poor people still lay .... My master opened his portfolio, put it on his lap and waited for the moon to come out from behind the large cloud that was hiding it .... At last the moon shone so brightly that it seemed like daylight. Amidst the pools of blood, we could make out some of the corpses‚Äîsome lying on their backs, others on their bellies; this one in a kneeling position, that one with his arms raised toward heaven, begging for vengeance or mercy .... While I stared at the terrible scene, filled with dread, my master drew it. We returned home and the next morning my master showed me his first print of La Guerra, which I looked at in horror. 'Sir,' I asked him, 'Why do you draw these barbarities which men commit?' He replied, 'To warn men not to be barbarians ever again.' \\"Ferrari, Enrique Lafuente; Licht et al, 82‚Äì83 Goya scholars are sceptical of the account; Nigel Glendinning described it as a \\"romantic fantasy\\", and detailed its many inaccuracies.In a BBC television documentary, Glendinning said: \\"Trueba is clearly romanticising the artist, making the artist fearless and heroic, I mean not to just observe through the spy glass these terrible things that are happening, but actually going to see them ... None of this corresponds at all to the reality of the shootings. Because we know the shootings took place at four or five o'clock in the morning. Some modern experts point out it was also raining, and so the idea that Goya is going out at midnight, he's not going to see anything. None of this fits with historical information we have.\\" Glendinning also pointed out that Trueba places Goya in his house known as Quinta del Sordo. Goya moved into this house in 1819, after the war, casting further doubt on Trueba's version. See The Private Life of a Masterpiece: The Third of May, 1808, Tx BBC2, 26 January 2004; released on DVD by 2 Entertain Video, 2007. Technique and style Detailing and protesting the ugliness of life is a common theme throughout the history of Spanish art, from the dwarves of Diego Vel√°zquez to Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937). Reflecting on The Disasters of War, biographer Margherita Abbruzzese notes that Goya asks that the truth \\"be seen and ... shown to others; including those who have no wish to see it .... And the blind in spirit stay their eyes on the outward aspect of things, then these outward aspects must be twisted and deformed until they cry out what they are trying to say.\\" The series follows a wider European tradition of war art and the examination of the effect of military conflict on civilian life‚Äîprobably mostly known to Goya via prints. This tradition is reflected especially in Dutch depictions of the Eighty Years' War with Spain, and in the work of 16th-century German artists like Hans Baldung. It is believed Goya owned a copy of a famous set of 18 etchings by Jacques Callot known as Les Grandes Mis√®res de la guerre (1633), which record the devastating impact on Lorraine of Louis XIII's troops during the Thirty Years' War.Becker DP; in Spangeberg, Kristin (ed). Six Centuries of Master Prints. Cincinnati: Cincinnati Art Museum, 1993. 154. Plate 37: Esto es peor (This is worse). In the aftermath of battle, the mutilated torsos and limbs of civilian victims were mounted on trees, like \\"fragments of marble sculpture\\". The dead man in plate 37, Esto es peor (This is worse), forms a mutilated body of a Spanish fighter spiked on a tree, surrounded by the corpses of French soldiers. It is based in part on the Hellenistic fragment of a male nude, the Belvedere Torso by the Athenian \\"Apollonios son of Nestor\\". Goya had earlier made a black wash drawing study of the statue during a visit to Rome. In Esto es peor he subverts the classical motifs used in war art through his addition of a degree of black theatre‚Äîthe branch piercing the body through the anus, twisted neck and close framing.Stoichita and Coderch, 95‚Äì96 The man is naked; a daring factor for Spanish art in the 19th century, during the time of the Spanish Inquisition.Cottom, 58 Art critic Robert Hughes remarked that the figures in this image \\"remind us that, if only they had been marble and the work of their destruction had been done by time rather than sabres, neo-classicists like Menges would have been in aesthetic raptures over them.\\"Hughes (2004), 295 Goya abandons colour in the series, believing that light, shade and shadow provide for a more direct expression of the truth. He wrote, \\"In art there is no need for colour. Give me a crayon and I will 'paint' your portrait.\\" He uses line not so much to delineate shape but, according to art historian Anne Hollander, \\"to scratch forms into existence and then splinter them, as a squinting, half blind eye might apprehend them, to create the distorting visual detritus that shudders around the edge of things seen in agonized haste .... This 'graphic' kind of clarity can be most sharp when it is most jagged.\\"Hollander, 254 The immediacy of the approach suited his desire to convey the primitive side of man's nature. He was not the first to work in this manner; Rembrandt had sought a similar directness, but did not have access to aquatint. William Blake and Henry Fuseli, contemporaries of Goya's, produced works with similarly fantastical content, but, as Hollander describes, they muted its disturbing impact with \\"exquisitely applied linearity ... lodging it firmly in the safe citadels of beauty and rhythm.\\"Hollander, 254‚Äì55 In his 1947 book on Goya's etchings, English author Aldous Huxley observed that the images depict a recurrent series of pictorial themes: darkened archways \\"more sinister than those even of Piranesi's Prisons\\"; street corners as settings for the cruelty of the disparities of class; and silhouetted hilltops carrying the dead, sometimes featuring a single tree serving as gallows or repository for dismembered corpses. \\"And so the record proceeds, horror after horror, unalleviated by any of the splendors which other painters have been able to discover in war; for, significantly, Goya never illustrates an engagement, never shows us impressive masses of troops marching in column or deployed in the order of battle .... All he shows us is war's disasters and squalors, without any of the glory or even picturesqueness.\\"Huxley, 12‚Äì13 The Disasters of War is the second of Goya's four major print series, which constitute almost all of his most important work in the medium. He also created 35 prints early in his career‚Äîmany of which are reproductions of his portraits and other works‚Äîand about 16 lithographs while living in France.Wilson-Bareau, Chapter 2. See also the listings of Harris catalogue numbers for all the prints on 100‚Äì106 His first series, the 80-plate Caprichos, were completed between 1797 and 1799 to document \\"the innumerable foibles and follies to be found in any civilized society, and ... the common prejudices and deceitful practices which custom, ignorance, or self-interest have made usual.\\"Hughes (2004), 181. Wilson- Bareau, 23‚Äì26 for dates. Caprichos was put on sale in 1799, but was almost immediately withdrawn after threats from the Inquisition.Wilson-Bareau, 23 In The Disasters of Wars first two groups of prints, Goya largely departs from the imaginative, synthetic approach of Caprichos to realistically depict life- and-death scenes of war. In the last group, the Caprichos sense of the fantastic returns.alt=Four or five men fly with contraptions resembling bat's wings attached to their arms. Between 1815 and 1816, Goya produced the Tauromachia, a series of 33 bullfighting scenes, during a break from The Disasters of War. Tauromachia was not politically sensitive, and was published at the end of 1816 in an edition of 320‚Äîfor sale individually or in sets‚Äîwithout incident. It did not meet with critical or commercial success.Wilson-Bareau, 61, 64, and 67 While in France, Goya completed a set of four larger lithographs, Los toros de Burdeos (The Bulls of Bordeaux).Wilson- Bareau, 91‚Äì95 His final series, known as Los Disparates (The Follies), Proverbios (Proverbs), or Sue√±os (Dreams), contains 22 large plates and at least five drawings that are seemingly part of the series but which were never etched. All these were left in Madrid‚Äîapparently incomplete and with only a handful of proofs printed‚Äîwhen Goya went to France in 1823. One plate is known to have been etched in 1816, but little else is established about the chronology of the works, or Goya's plans for the set.Wilson-Bareau, 77‚Äì78 Goya worked on The Disasters of War during a period when he was producing images more for his own satisfaction than for any contemporary audience.Goya's introspection late in this period can be witnessed in the enigmatic Black Paintings which he painted directly onto the walls of his house between 1819 and 1823. His work came to rely less on historical incidents than his own imagination. Many of the later plates contain fantastical motifs which can be seen as a return to the imagery of the Caprichos. In this, he is relying on visual clues derived from his inner life, rather than anything that could be recognised from real events or settings.Hollander, 253 Interpretation In The Disasters of War, Goya does not excuse any purpose to the random slaughter‚Äîthe plates are devoid of the consolation of divine order or the dispensation of human justice.Licht, 130‚Äì152 This in part a result of the absence of melodrama or consciously artful presentation that would distance the viewer from the brutality of the subjects, as found in Baroque martyrdom. In addition, Goya refuses to offer the stability of traditional narrative. Instead, his composition tends to highlight the most disturbing aspects of each work.Licht, 132‚Äì142 alt=The bodies of captive men hang from trees while soldiers and civilians look on. A man to the right comforts a woman. The plates are set spaces without fixed boundaries; the mayhem extends outside the frames of the picture plane in all directions. Thus, they express the randomness of violence, and in their immediacy and brutality they have been described as analogous to 19th- and 20th-century photojournalism.Licht, 130‚Äì133, 143‚Äì144 According to Robert Hughes, as with Goya's earlier Caprichos series, The Disasters of War is likely to have been intended as a \\"social speech\\"; satires on the then prevailing \\"hysteria, evil, cruelty and irrationality [and] the absence of wisdom\\" of Spain under Napoleon, and later the Inquisition.Hughes (1990), 63 It is evident Goya viewed the Spanish war with disillusionment, and despaired both for the violence around him and for the loss of a liberal ideal he believed was being replaced by a new militant unreason. Hughes believed Goya's decision to render the images through etchings, which by definition are absent of colour, indicates feelings of utter hopelessness. His message late in life is contrary to the humanistic view of man as essentially good but easily corrupted. He seems to be saying that violence is innate in man, \\"forged in the substance of what, since Freud, we have called the id.\\" Hughes believed that in the end there is only the violated emptiness of acceptance of our fallen nature: like the painting of Goya's dog, \\"whose master is as absent from him as God is from Goya.\\"Hughes (1990), 64 The Disasters of War plates are preoccupied with wasted bodies, undifferentiated body parts, castration and female abjection. There are dark erotic undertones to a number of the works. Connell notes the innate sexuality of the image in plate 7‚ÄîAgustina de Arag√≥n's igniting a long cannon. The art historian Lennard Davis suggests that Goya was fascinated with the \\"erotics of dismemberment\\",Shaw, 485 while Hughes mentions plate 10 in Los disparates, which shows a woman carried in the grip of a horse's mouth. To Hughes, the woman's euphoria suggests, among other possible meanings, orgasm. Legacy Despite being one of the most significant anti-war works of art, The Disasters of War had no impact on the European consciousness for two generations, as it was not seen outside a small circle in Spain until it was published by Madrid's Royal Academy of San Fernando in 1863.Hughes (2004), 304 Since then, interpretations in successive eras have reflected the sensibilities of the time. Goya was seen as a proto-Romantic in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on Th√©odore G√©ricault,Hughes (1990), 51 best known for the politically charged Raft of the Medusa (1818‚Äì19). Luis Bu√±uel identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 L'√Çge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dal√≠, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel. The series' impact on Dal√≠ is evident in Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War), painted in 1936 in response to events leading to the Spanish Civil War. Here, the distorted limbs, brutal suppression, agonised expressions and ominous clouds are reminiscent of plate 39, Grande haza√±a! Con muertos! (A heroic feat! With dead men!), in which mutilated bodies are shown against a backdrop barren landscape.Licht, 151 In 1993, Jake and Dinos Chapman of the Young British Artists movement created 82 miniature, toy-like sculptures modelled on The Disasters of War. The works were widely acclaimed and purchased that year by the Tate gallery.Disasters of War 1993. Tate. Retrieved 29 August 2009. For decades, Goya's series of etching served as a constant point of reference for the Chapman brothers; in particular, they created a number of variations based on the plate Grande haza√±a! Con muertos!. In 2003, the Chapman brothers exhibited an altered version of The Disasters of War. They purchased a complete set of prints,An edition that had been published in 1937, as a protest against fascist atrocities in the Spanish Civil War. over which they drew and pasted demonic clown and puppy heads.Jake and Dinos Chapman. \\"Insult to Injury\\". artnet.com, 9 March 2004.

Deanin, p319 is a naturally occurring asphalt that has been put to many uses since ancient times. It is a light- sensitive material in what is accepted to be the first complete photographic process, i.e., one capable of producing durable light-fast results. The technique was developed by French scientist and inventor Nic√©phore Ni√©pce in the 1820s. In 1826 or 1827,Eder History of Photography} p. 203 he applied a thin coating of the tar-like material to a pewter plate and took a picture of parts of the buildings and surrounding countryside of his estate, producing what is usually described as the first photograph. It is considered to be the oldest known surviving photograph made in a camera. The plate was exposed in the camera for at least eight hours. The bitumen, initially soluble in spirits and oils, was hardened and made insoluble (probably polymerized) in the brightest areas of the image. The unhardened part was then rinsed away with a solvent.Ni√©pce Museum history pages Hirsch, Robert. Seizing the Light: A History of Photography. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2000. Print. Ni√©pce's primary objective was not a photoengraving or photolithography process, but rather a photo-etching process since engraving requires the intervention of a physical rather than chemical process and lithography involves a grease and water resistance process. However, the famous image of the Cardinal was produced first by photo-etching and then \\"improved\\" by hand engraving. Bitumen, superbly resistant to strong acids, was in fact later widely used as a photoresist in making printing plates for mechanical printing processes. The surface of a zinc or other metal plate was coated, exposed, developed with a solvent that laid bare the unexposed areas, then etched in an acid bath, producing the required surface relief.Beaumont Newhall, \\"The History of Photography,\\" 2001, p 14.

Mythology  The myth of her transformation begins in Arcadia when she came across a clear stream and began bathing, not knowing it was the river god Alpheus, who flowed down from Arcadia through Elis to the sea. He fell in love during their encounter, but she fled after discovering his presence and intentions, as she wished to remain a chaste attendant of Artemis. After a long chase, she prayed to her goddess to ask for protection. Artemis hid her in a cloud, but Alpheus was persistent. She began to perspire profusely from fear, and soon transformed into a stream. Artemis then broke the ground allowing Arethusa another attempt to flee.Ovid, Metamorphoses 5.710 Her stream traveled under the sea to the island of Ortygia, but Alpheus flowed through the sea to reach her and mingle with her waters.Pausanias, Description of Greece 5.7.3 Virgil augurs for Arethusa a salt-free passage beneath the sea on the condition that, before departing, she grant him songs about troubled loves, not those in her own future, but those of Virgil's friend and contemporary, the poet Cornelius Gallus, whom Virgil imagines dying from unrequited love beneath the famous mountains of Arcadia, Maenalus and Lycaeus.Virgil, Bucolics 10.1‚Äì15 Silver decadrachm of Arethusa, minted in 145x145pxDuring Demeter's search for her daughter Persephone, Arethusa entreated Demeter to discontinue her punishment of Sicily for her daughter's disappearance. She told the goddess that while traveling in her stream below the earth, she saw her daughter looking sad as the queen of Hades.Ovid, Metamorphoses 5.407 The Roman writer Ovid called Arethusa by the name \\"Alpheias\\", because her stream was believed to have a subterranean communication with the river Alpheius, in Peloponnesus.Ovid, Metamorphoses 5. 487 Apart from retellings by classical authors including Ovid and Virgil, Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote a poem on Arethusa in 1820. Anne Ridler's \\"Evenlode\\" (1959), which she described as \\"a fable of rivers designed for broadcasting with music,\\" has Alpheus and Arethusa as its main characters.  Coin of Arethusa  As a patron figure of Syracuse, the head of Arethusa surrounded by dolphins was a usual type on their coins.Coins of Arethusa (contains verse from Ovid and Shelley); \\"Changes in the Depiction of Arethusa on the Coins of Syracuse\\", PCGS They are regarded as among the most famous and beautiful Ancient Greek coins.[http://www.paulfrasercollectibles.com/news/coins-and- banknotes/2012-news-archive/syracuse-arethusa-decadrachm-coins-offered-for- sale-in-ancient-coins-auction/ Paul Fraser Coins, \\"In his definitive 1990 book \\"Ancient Greek Coins\\", the numismatist G. K. Jenkins describes Syracusan decadrachms of this period as \\"perhaps the most famous of all ancient coins\\".\\"  In music  Karol Szymanowski, polish classical music composer named \\"The Fountain of Arethusa\\" first of his three poems entitled \\"Myths\\" for violin and piano. The Saucy Arethusa is an 18th-century song about a British naval ship named after Arethusa. A song on the album Her Majesty the Decemberists by The Decemberists called \\"Shanty for the Arethusa\\" is about a different ship called Arethusa. A movement of Benjamin Britten's oboe piece Six Metamorphoses After Ovid is entitled \\"Arethusa.\\" Also Ralph Vaughan Williams, the English classical music composer, composed \\"Sea Songs\\", a quick march for both brass band and wind band written in 1923, used a Morris Dance tune 'The Royal Princess' which was also known by the title 'The Arethusa', alongside two other shanty tunes 'Admiral Benbow' and 'Portsmouth'. 'The Princess Royal' is one of the most celebrated of Turlough O'Carolan's compositions, largely because of its association with the words of the song 'The Aretusa', to which it was set by Shield toward the end of the eighteenth century. The song of 'The Aretusa' originally appeared in a small opera or musical entertainment called 'The Lock and Key', which was acted in 1796. The Princess Royal was composed for the eldest daughter in Carolan's time of The MacDermott Roe of Coolavin. It is perhaps worth mentioning that there is an English folk song, of fairly wide distribution in England which is entitled 'The Princess Royal' but has no connection with Carolan's melody.

N√°mestie Slobody (), locally referred to as Gottko, is a major city square in the Old Town of Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. It is situated in the wider city center, close to Koll√°rovo square and in front of the Summer Archbishop's Palace.  History  The location of the current square was covered with vineyards during medieval times. It probably originated in the 17th century, with the Summer Archbishop's Palace which was built there. It currently houses the Slovak government. Later it was rebuilt as a grass area, which was divided by an alley of trees. It was called Knie≈æacie or F√ºrstenallee and Hercegfasor. The Slovak expression Fir≈°n√°l originated from F√ºrstenallee. The square was called Gottwaldovo during socialism in honor of the first Czechoslovak communist president Klement Gottwald, whose statue was included. The Post Office palace (the biggest post office in the world) and buildings of Slovak Technical University were built there during the 1940s and 1950s, closing the square in from all sides. The biggest fountain in Bratislava stands there, which was built in 1980. It was one of the first squares in Bratislava that was renamed after the Velvet Revolution in 1989.  Fountain of Union  The square's centerpiece is the Fountain of Union (), built from 1979 to 1980 by sculptors Juraj Hovorka, Tibor B√°rtfay, Karol Lacko and architects Virgil Droppa and Juraj Hlavica. It is the biggest fountain in Bratislava and in the whole Slovak Republic. The fountain consists of a basin and a 9 meters tall sculpture of a linden flower weighing 12 tons. The fountain features a tunnel and a relatively large machine room, located underneath the fountain. Due to water continually entering the underground control spaces because of lack of maintenance after the fall of Communism in 1989, the technological and electrical parts of the fountain are severely damaged. The hydroisolation of the basin is damaged as well. Since 2007, the fountain is out of order, its restoration would cost an estimated 1 million euros. Since 2010, when plans to reconstruct the whole square emerged, the Fountain of Union is not included in any of these plans. The only institution to publicly declare its support to include the fountain in the future is Paming a municipal company that is in the process of ceasing operation.

Her first recorded work was as vocalist for the avant garde jazz-pop band Shopping Trolley, which released one eponymous album on Hannibal Records in 1989 (Catalog # HNBL 1349). That album was compared to Manhattan Transfer and received positive reviews, but the band broke up shortly afterward. Since then she has been a long-term member of Pook's 10-piece ensemble, appearing on record and in concert as one of the ensemble's three vocalists. As part of the Ensemble, she has contributed to the soundtracks of Hollywood blockbuster films, Eyes Wide Shut and Gangs of New York. She also does the vocal work on the majority of Pook's music, appearing on the album Deluge (later reissued as Flood) and Untold Things. Pappenheim's work with Simon Fisher-Turner has included contributions to the soundtracks of two Derek Jarman films. Turner has compared Pappenheim's work ethic to that of Jarman's, in that there is a great understanding between them without much communicating. (His actual quote was, \\"She just does what she likes...\\".Longley, Martin. \\"Rock & Pop: Angelic Conversation\\". October 31, 2003. Independent, p. 19. (via Lexis-Nexis)) Pappenheim has been a member of Gough's 16 piece choir The Shout since 1998. In 2009, at the invitation of producer Giles Perring, Pappenheim recorded for the album 'Poets and LIghthouses' by Tuvan singer Albert Kuvezin. She has regularly performed Paul Clark's score 'Here All Night' - a words and music collaboration with Beckett specialists Gare St Lazare - in the UK, Ireland and US. Doctor Who Pappenheim has garnered critical and popular acclaim for her work on Doctor Who due to the ethereal vocals she provided for the Doctor's leitmotif ‚Äì which the producers described semi-seriously as \\"President Flavia (from The Five Doctors) singing out of the time vortex\\". As a result, many of the show's fans refer to her as \\"Flavia\\". Her vocals on the track \\"Doomsday\\" (used in the d√©nouement of the eponymous episode) caused an influx of emails to the BBC about her contribution to the soundtrack. She subsequently appeared on Murray's second soundtrack, composed for the third series of the show and would also return to contribute her vocals to the 2007 Christmas special, Voyage of the Damned, the November 2009 Special The Waters of Mars and the 2009 Christmas Special The End of Time. As a contributor to the show's soundtrack, Pappenheim has appeared at two special live concerts to celebrate the music by Murray Gold. The first was played at the Millennium Centre in Cardiff in 2006, and the second as part of the BBC Proms on 27 July 2008 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Theatre work Pappenheim's work in avant- garde theatre has included a memorable appearance as a topless female Christ figure in the 1992 DV8 Physical Theatre production Strange Fish, in which she sang while hanging from a full-size crucifix.Meisner, Nadine. \\"Interviews: Lloyd Newson\\".

Since its inception, Usenet newsgroups have attracted a wide variety of people posting all manner of fact, fiction, theories, opinions, and beliefs. Some Usenet posters achieved a certain amount of fame (or infamy) and celebrity within Usenet circles because of their unusual, non-mainstream ideas, or because their writings and responses are considered especially humorous or bizarre.  Eccentric believers  These individuals (or user-IDs, or pseudonyms) are noted for their eccentric beliefs and theories. * Alexander Abian (1923‚Äì1999) ‚Äì American mathematician who taught for many years at Iowa State University and became an Internet legend for his incessant and frequently bizarre posts to various Usenet newsgroups. In particular, he gained international notoriety for his claims that blowing up the Moon would solve virtually every problem of human existence, and that mass and time are equivalent. (With regard to the second claim, it was suggested on the \\"sci.astro.amateur\\" newsgroup that his demise be observed with a gram of silence.) Usenet posting on the occasion of Professor Alexander Abian's death One of Dr. Abian's most endearing hypotheses was the challenge to the Big Bang Theory with the Big Suck Theory. * Robert E. McElwaine (1948?‚Äì2008) ‚Äì self- described Bachelor of Science in physics who wrote a series of ranting fringe science essays characteristically peppered with capitalized words for emphasis. Each essay covered topics such as alien influence on violence, free energy, coming UFO landings, and cancer cures, often carrying a message that there existed a conspiracy to suppress the information. The essays often concluded with the signature \\"UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED, ESPECIALLY to COMPUTER BULLETIN BOARDS.\\" McElwaine's writings stopped appearing on Usenet after 1998, although he continued writing essays up to 2003. He died at age 59 in his home in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, on 12 February 2008. * Archimedes Plutonium (current legal name, born Ludwig Poehlmann in 1950, raised as Ludwig Hansen, also known as Ludwig van Ludvig and Ludwig Plutonium) ‚Äì noted for his many posts about his own theories of physics, mathematics, and stock market investing, and in particular his \\"Plutonium Atom Totality\\" theory, which posits that the universe is a giant plutonium atom and that galaxies are \\"dots\\" in the electron dot cloud of this atom. * Jack Sarfatti ‚Äì American author of a number of popular works on quantum physics and consciousness, known for his iconoclastic ideas concerning the schism between science and the humanities, as well as space migration, intelligence increase, life extension, UFOs, extraterrestrials, time travel, and psychokinesis.  Criminal and eccentric personalities  These individuals (or user-IDs, or pseudonyms) are noted for their criminal, eccentric, paranoid, or threatening behavior, or newsgroup trolling activities. * Scott Abraham ‚Äì skiing enthusiast banned by court order in 1999 from posting on the Usenet discussion group \\"rec.skiing.alpine\\", after engaging in a flame war with other online posters. The heated exchanges lasted for months, eventually escalating into death threats, until a police detective from Seattle posted a request for all involved to calm down. All involved did except Abraham, which ultimately led to a court order being filed against him. The Electronic Frontier Foundation and other civil liberties groups commented that this violated free speech protection, but did not deny that Abraham's aggressive behavior exceeded the boundaries of normal newsgroup civility.\\"Usenet Ban a Slippery Slope?\\", wired.com, 16 November 1999 * Serdar Argic ‚Äì alias used in one of the first automated newsgroup spam incidents on Usenet, with the objective of denying the Armenian Genocide. It was an automated bot that made thousands of posts to several newsgroups (especially \\"soc.history\\", \\"soc.culture.turkish\\", and \\"misc.headlines\\") in 1994.Wendy Grossman, Net.Wars, NYU Press, 1997, chapter 11 (a) (b) The deluge of posts suddenly disappeared in April 1994, after Stefan Chakerian created a specific newsgroup (\\"alt.cancel.bots\\") to carry only cancel messages specifically for any post from any machine downstream from the UUNET feed which carried Serdar Argic's messages. * David D'Amato ‚Äì former assistant principal and director of guidance at West Hempstead High School,http://www.courthousenews.com/2016/03/07/man-says-tickling-contest- film-defamed-him.htm he actively spammed and trolled a variety of newsgroups (particularly \\"alt.gothic\\" and \\"rec.music.phish\\") from roughly 1996 to 1999, initiated e-mail bombings against those he considered \\"opponents,\\" and solicited for video recordings of young adult males being bound and tickled, all while using the pseudonym/alter ego Terri DiSisto, who was supposedly a female college student. D'Amato was found guilty of e-mail bombings which caused service outages at a number of colleges and universities, was fined $5,000 (USD), and spent six months in federal prison after being convicted in 2001. He is a subject of the 2016 documentary Tickled. He died in March 2017. * Valery Fabrikant ‚Äì former associate professor of mechanical engineering at Concordia University, he shot and killed four colleagues in the school massacre referred to as the Concordia University massacre. He is currently serving a prison sentence in Canada. Fabrikant has posted in several newsgroups, particularly \\"can.general\\" and \\"can.politics\\", claiming that he is the innocent victim of a conspiracy against him. These posts can be found at an archive of his home page.Archive: Valery Fabrikant's home page * Hipcrime ‚Äì called \\"a leading Usenet terrorist,\\" this user wrote and distributed software applications that allow users to modify or cancel newsgroups posts, and to generate large volumes of e-mail spam. These have been classified as denial of service (DoS) and spamming programs. The pseudonym is derived from a neologism appearing in the science fiction novel Stand on Zanzibar by John Brunner. Hipcrime has never been positively identified and thus it is unknown if it is the work of a single person or a group. * MI5Victim (Mike Corley, a.k.a. Boleslaw Tadeusz Szocik) ‚Äì paranoid user who goes through periods of binge posting, claiming that British intelligence has bugged his home and is sending people to follow him around and harass him. These allegations are often crossposted to newsgroups where his messages would be considered off- topic. This has led to claims that he suffers from paranoia. Since 1995 he has posted transcripts and snippets of conversations that he has recorded, citing it as evidence, sometimes years after the actual event. He has also claimed in his posts that television personalities are often talking about him in code and are part of the MI5 conspiracy. After applying the cui bono test, many people have found it difficult to understand why Corley should have been targeted by MI5 (given that he has no connections/affiliations which would make him of interest), and cannot see what possible benefit the security services could derive from such harassment, given that they have always had more pressing concerns, e.g. monitoring PIRA in the 1990s and later the threat posed by al-Qaeda. Corley will often cross-post \\"examples\\" of MI-5 victimizing him 20 or 30 posts at a time. He has been banned from posting through Google for his abuse of Usenet, and has been similarly bounced from most ISPs in England,\\"A suspicious radio/printer for Mike Corley\\" by Regine (25 February 2008) an assertion which Corley rebutted in August 2012. In the past, his posts were relatively easy to filter out, due to his similar subject lines and email address. However, at the start of 2008, he began a series of posts that avoided filters through sporgery and by slightly varying his subject line of \\"MI-5 Persecution\\", showing an ability to adapt. In 2007, the opera The Corley Conspiracy by Tim Benjamin and Sean Starke premiered at the Southbank Centre in London. Corley has his own web site on which he provides so-called evidence of the conspiracies against him. Corley has written a book about his \\"experiences\\" with MI5.  Unusual personalities  These are individuals (or user-IDs) that are unusual for reasons other than being eccentric. * B1FF (or BIFF) ‚Äì well-known pseudonym and prototypical newbie on Usenet. Posts usually consisted of uppercase text containing many bangs (\\"!\\"), typos, \\"cute\\" misspellings, the use (and often misuse) of fragments of chat abbreviations, a long signature block, sometimes a doubled signature, and exaggerated na√Øvet√©. The BIFF pseudonym was originally created by Joe Talmadge, also the author of the infamous and much-copied Flamer's Bible. Talmadge posted twice as BIFF and after that Richard Sexton, who posted as BIFF a few dozen times over the next year or two.The story of BIFF \\"BIFF history, by BIFF.\\" * Joel K. \\"Jay\\" Furr ‚Äì Usenet poster in the early 1990s immortalized in the newsgroups \\"alt.fan.joel- furr\\", \\"alt.bonehead.joel-furr\\", and \\"alt.joel-furr.die.die.die\\". He was a pretender to the throne of James \\"Kibo\\" Parry, and the bitter enemy of Serdar Argic. Furr was also notable on Usenet for his self-appointed leadership over the \\"alt\\" hierarchy during the commercial expansion of the Internet (ca. 1993‚Äì1995), during which he attempted to bring some order and rationale to rampant newsgroup creation, but with minimal success. According to Brad Templeton, Furr is one of the earliest people to refer to unsolicited electronic messages as \\"spam\\". * Gharlane of Eddore (1947‚Äì2001) ‚Äì pseudonym of David G. Potter, a science fiction writer and critic in Sacramento, California, who was widely known for acerbic, scathingly humorous and knowledgeable postings to Usenet science fiction newsgroups. He guarded his true identity carefully for many years before his death in 2001. His chief surviving non-fictional work is the Lensman FAQ and voluminous Usenet postings. * The Internet Oracle (a.k.a. The Usenet Oracle) ‚Äì collective effort at humor in a question-and-answer format, wherein a user sends a question to the Oracle via e-mail or the Internet Oracle website, which is then randomly sent to another user who has asked a previous question. This second user may then answer the question. Meanwhile, the original questioner is also sent a question which he may choose to answer. All exchanges are conducted through a central distribution system which also makes all users anonymous. A completed question-and-answer pair is called an \\"oracularity\\". Many exchanges make allusions to Zen koans, witty word play, and computer geek humor, as well as in-jokes. * Kibo ‚Äì pseudonym of James Parry, who provided the basis for the formation of an entire newsgroup, \\"alt.religion.kibology\\". Kibo was known for his high-volume but thoughtful posts, but achieved Usenet celebrity circa 1991 by writing a small script to grep his entire Usenet feed for instances of his name, and then answering personally whenever and wherever he was mentioned, giving the illusion that he was personally reading the entire feed. * Mark V Shaney ‚Äì pseudonym of an automated program that used Markov chain logic to recombine the text of posts into nearly coherent posts. * Publius ‚Äì anonymous poster who, from 1994 to 1995, used the Penet remailer service to deliver cryptic messages to \\"alt.music.pink-floyd\\". These posts revealed that an enigma had been hidden within Pink Floyd's The Division Bell, and Publius called upon fans to find the solution. Although the remailer service was shut down in 1995 and Publius has not been heard from since, the puzzle and the prize for solving it were acknowledged by Pink Floyd's drummer, Nick Mason, at a book signing in 2005.Nick Mason's Inside Out Tour \\"Publius Enigma Explained!!!\\" The Publius Enigma has never been officially solved.  Other personalities  These people are known for their exceptional and widely read contributions within their respective Usenet communities. * John C. Baez ‚Äì mathematical physicist at the University of California, Riverside, known to science fans as the author of This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics,\\"This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics\\", John Baez an irregular column on the web featuring mathematical exposition and criticism, which he started in 1993 for the Usenet community and which now has a worldwide following. Baez is also known on the World Wide Web as the author of the crackpot index, a humorous numerical method for rating scientific claims and the individuals that make them. * Torkel Franz√©n (1950‚Äì2006) ‚Äì Swedish academic who worked at Lule√• University of Technology, Sweden, in the fields of mathematical logic and computer science. He was known for his work on G√∂del's incompleteness theorems and for his contributions to Usenet. * Tilman Hausherr ‚Äì German poster who is well known among critics of Scientology for his frequent Usenet posts and for maintaining a website critical of Scientology. He is also credited with coining the term \\"sporgery\\". * James Nicoll ‚Äì science-fiction reviewer and retired game-store owner. As a Usenet personality, Nicoll is known for writing a widely quoted epigram on the English language, as well as for his contributions of concepts like the Nicoll-Dyson Laser and the \\"brain eater\\" to Usenet groups like \\"rec.arts.sf.written\\" and \\"rec.arts.sf.fandom\\"; and for his accounts of suffering a high number of accidents (known collectively as \\"Nicoll Events\\") recounted in these groups. * Brad Templeton ‚Äì software architect, civil rights advocate and entrepreneur. An early luminary of Usenet, Templeton founded ClariNet Communications Corporation and created the newsgroup rec.humor.funny in 1987 and moderated it from 1987 to 1992. * Erik Naggum ‚Äî a Norwegian computer programmer recognized for his work in the fields of SGML, Emacs and Lisp.

History The Lyc√©e was established in 1937 so that the extensive French community in Mexico could give a French education and culture to their family and stay linked to their motherland. Since then the school has evolved a lot and the number of students has increased considerably. Nowadays the school receives mostly French-Mexican and Mexican students, but also children of many diplomats from all over the world, the children of all the French expatriate workers and many other students from other European countries. Structure Before the equivalent of high school, the school is divided into a \\"French\\" and a \\"bilingual\\" section. In the first one, all the courses are given in French (except language courses). In the other section, the classes are taught in Spanish, but they include a French language course. By high school, students of the \\"bilingual\\" section are proficient in the language and the two sections are mixed together under the French system and all courses are in French. Academic performance The academic level of the school is extremely good and it is recognized as one of the best schools in Mexico, especially recognized for its high level of mathematics (on the same level than the Mexican-Japanese Lyceum and the Colegio Alem√°n Alexander von Humboldt). The results of the Baccalaur√©at are especially good, with 97% of students having passed the exam. After graduating, the students follow several paths. The majority are admitted into prestigious Mexican universities, however a good amount also follow superior studies in French universities and the so-called \\"classes prepa\\". There is also an increasing number of students who decide to study in other countries (US, Switzerland, UK, etc.). Architecture The school building was designed by Vladimir Kasp√©.Turner, Jane.

The team was Omaha's second AAA and American Association franchise, succeeding the Omaha Cardinals of 1955-59. The Omaha Dodgers were the transplanted St. Paul Saints of the Association, a longtime Dodger farm team that was displaced after the 1960 season when the Minnesota Twins moved from Washington, D.C., to bring Major League Baseball to Minneapolis-St. Paul. The O-Dodgers were one of two AAA farm clubs of the Dodgers at the time (the Spokane Indians of the Pacific Coast League were the other), and the Omaha club was managed in both seasons of its existence by Danny Ozark, who a decade later would become well known as manager of the Philadelphia Phillies. The 1961 Omaha Dodgers finished last in the six-team Association with a record of 62 wins and 87 defeats (.416), 23¬Ω games behind the pennant-winning Indianapolis Indians. They drew 120,000 fans. In 1962, Omaha climbed all the way to second place with a mark of 79 wins and 68 defeats (.537), ten games behind Indianapolis, but were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the Denver Bears. The 1962 club drew 109,000 fans, fourth in the six-team league. Members of the O-Dodgers included Bill Lajoie, future MLB front office executive (then an outfielder), and Pete Richert, who would forge a long career in baseball as a relief pitcher. At the close of the 1962 season, the American Association disbanded. The Omaha Dodgers and Louisville Colonels folded, and the surviving clubs were absorbed into the Pacific Coast League and the International League. In 1969, the Association was revived and the Omaha Royals became a charter member. The club still exists, but the Association ‚Äî even though it was thriving as the third AAA league ‚Äî again disbanded after the 1997 season in a minor-league reorganization, and its teams were absorbed by the two surviving AAA leagues. The Royals, therefore, now play in the Pacific Coast League.

He was a second generation Japanese American. Biography Wakabayashi's parents had immigrated to Hawaii from Hiroshima, Japan, and Wakabayashi was born in Hawaii, giving him dual citizenship between the United States and Japan. He renounced his Japanese citizenship in 1928, but revived it when he moved to Japan. Baseball career =High school and college= Wakabayashi attended President William McKinley High School, and his powerful fastball made him the ace pitcher of the school's baseball team. In 1928, he was chosen to participate in an exhibition baseball tournament held in Japan, and he traveled to Japan for the first time that year. Professional baseball did not exist in Japan at that time, and Wakabayashi's amateur team played against university teams in the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League. Wakabayashi's pitching abilities did not go unnoticed, and Hosei University was particularly active in recruiting him. Wakabayashi himself was not opposed to the idea of remaining in Japan, and it seemed only a matter of time before he was admitted into Hosei University. However, rival schools accused Hosei University of using unethical tactics to strengthen the baseball team, and the school decided to temporarily place Wakabayashi in a junior high school in Yokohama, and admit him into the school the following year. Wakabayashi graduated from the junior high school in March 1929, and entered Hosei University the next semester. The Tokyo Big6 Baseball League was dominated by Waseda University and Keio University, and the Hosei University team solely depended upon Wakabayashi's pitching to carry the team. He was unsuccessful in his first year due to differences between Japanese and American baseball, but gradually improved to win the league championship in Autumn, 1930. He injured his pitching arm in 1931, and had to switch to a side arm release to continue pitching. He was no longer able to throw fastballs, but improved his breaking pitches and control to continue his pitching success. Wakabayashi led Hosei University to a second league championship in 1932, and pitched in every single league game in 1934 to win a third championship. His record in the league was 43-28, and he holds the college league record for career games pitched (87). He was also the first pitcher to win 40 games in the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League. He also married his wife in January 1933. =Professional and semi-professional career= He graduated from the university in 1935, and a friend introduced him to the Columbia Music Entertainment company, where he split time between working, and playing on the company's baseball team. In July, 1935, the Tokyo Kyojin Gun baseball team returned from their tour in the United States, and numerous companies, including the Hanshin Electric Railway company, joined to form the first professional baseball league in Japan. Several companies made offers for Wakabayashi to join their professional team, and he signed with the Osaka Tigers (current Hanshin Tigers) in January 1936. Wakabayashi quickly emerged as the team's ace, and led the Tigers to championships in 1940 and 1944. Wakabayashi retreated to his wife's hometown in Ishinomaki, Miyagi at the end of World War II, but returned to professional baseball in 1947 to win his 200th professional game. He would mark 233 wins in his 13 seasons with the Tigers; the most among any Tigers pitcher in history. Wakabayashi doubled as a manager and player throughout the 1940s, and joined the Pacific League Mainichi Orions in 1950, when the modern two-league system of Japanese baseball was established. He was already 42 years old at this time, and no longer had the energy to spend the entire season as a player, but still pitched in the first game of the Japan Series against the Shochiku Robins, contributing to the Orions series championship in 1950. He also pitched a shut-out game against the Kintetsu Pearls in November, 1950, setting the Japanese record for the oldest pitcher to record a shut-out win. This record lasted for almost 60 years until Masahiro Yamamoto broke it in 2010 at the age of 45. Wakabayashi announced his retirement in 1953, and he pitched his last professional game that year to mark his 1000th strikeout. He managed to reach the landmark, but handed his team the loss in the process. Though much of his success as a player came before modern Japanese baseball was established in 1950, he is still recognized as one of the legendary pitchers in Japanese baseball. He won the league MVP award in 1944 and 1947, and was inducted into the Japanese baseball hall of fame in 1964. =Post-playing career= After retiring, he was given a position in the Mainichi franchise, but left after only one year to become a coach for the Tombow Unions. He worked as a pitching coach for the Taiyo Whales, and became the head coach for the Nishitetsu Lions in 1963. He was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1964, and left the Lions that year. He died on March 5, 1965, at age 57. Cultural impact When the Osaka Tigers played their first season in 1936, jersey numbers were given out in alphabetical order. Wakabayashi was assigned number 4, but he refused to wear the number because it is considered unlucky in Japan. He was given the first available number instead, which was 18. His subsequent success in the professional leagues made it a custom for a Japanese team's ace pitcher to be given the number ‚Äî for example, Daisuke Matsuzaka was given number 18 when he joined the Seibu Lions from high school. Wakabayashi's voluntary services and contributions to the community, including efforts to encourage and impact children through his founding of the Tigers Children's Club, publication of children's baseball magazines, visits to the juvenile detention centers and orphanage, led to the establishment of an Annual Tadashi Wakabayashi Award in 2011. The award is considered the \\"MVP outside of the baseball field\\" and recognizes one Hanshin Tigers' athlete each year who has demonstrated exceptional and sustained social and community services.

They are surrogate markers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and indicate a cellular immune response to M. tuberculosis.  Active vs latent tuberculosis  IGRAs cannot distinguish between latent infection and active tuberculosis (TB) disease, and should not be used as a sole method for diagnosis of active TB, which is a microbiological diagnosis. A positive IGRA result may not necessarily indicate TB infection, but can also be caused by infection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria. A negative IGRA does not rule out active TB disease; a number of studies have shown that up to a quarter of patients with active TB have negative IGRA results.  BCG Status  Because IGRAs are not affected by Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccination status, IGRAs are useful for evaluation of LTBI in BCG-vaccinated individuals, particularly in settings where BCG vaccination is administered after infancy or multiple (booster) BCG vaccinations are given. In contrast, the specificity of tuberculin skin test (TST) varies depending on timing of BCG and whether repeated (booster) vaccinations are given.  Commercial IGRA test  QuantiFERON, also known as QFT, is the registered trademark of the test for tuberculosis infection or latent tuberculosis. It is manufactured by QIAGEN. QFT is an interferon-Œ≥ release assay (IGRA) used in tuberculosis diagnosis. The QFT-GIT assay is an ELISA-based, whole-blood test that uses peptides from three TB antigens (ESAT-6, CFP-10, and TB7.7) in an in-tube format. The result is reported as quantification of IFN-gamma in international units (IU) per mL. An individual is considered positive for M. tuberculosis infection if the IFN-gamma response to TB antigens is above the test cut-off (after subtracting the background IFN-gamma response in the negative control).  Mantoux vs IGRA test  Since IGRAs are more costly and technically complex to do than the Mantoux test, in their 2011 policy statement, the WHO did not recommend replacing the Mantoux test by IGRAs as a public health intervention in low- and middle-income countries .  QuantiFERON-TB (QFT)  QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT), the third generation test, has replaced QuantiFERON-TB (QFT) and QuantiFERON- Gold, which are no longer marketed. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, in 2001, the QuantiFERON-TB test (QFT) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an aid for detecting latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. This test is an in vitro diagnostic aid that measures a component of cell-mediated immune reactivity to M. tuberculosis. The test is based on the quantification of interferon-gamma (IFN-Œ≥) released from sensitized lymphocytes in whole blood incubated overnight with purified protein derivative (PPD) from M. tuberculosis and control antigens. Tuberculin skin testing (TST) has been used for years as an aid in diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and includes measurement of the delayed type hypersensitivity response 48‚Äì72 hours after intradermal injection of PPD. TST and QFT do not measure the same components of the immunologic response and are not interchangeable. Assessment of the accuracy of these tests is limited by lack of a standard for confirming LTBI. As a diagnostic test, QFT: # requires phlebotomy # can be accomplished after a single patient visit # assesses responses to multiple antigens simultaneously # does not boost anamnestic immune responses (see Latent tuberculosis#Boosting). Compared with TST, QFT results are less subject to reader bias and error. In a CDC-sponsored multicenter trial, QFT and TST results were moderately concordant (overall kappa value = 0.60). The level of concordance was adversely affected by prior bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccination, immune reactivity to nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and a prior positive TST. In addition to the multicenter study, two other published studies have demonstrated moderate concordance between TST and QFT. However, one of the five sites involved in the CDC study reported less agreement. Although there have been studies confirming the increased future risk of active TB in individuals with positive TST, the same was not true for those with a positive IGRA result. A recently published study demonstrated that a positive IGRA result is predictive of future active TB risk. Moreover, IGRA was at least as sensitive and was more specific compared to traditional TST. In this study of immunocompetent recently exposed close contacts of active TB cases, the progression rate to active disease among untreated QFT positive individuals was significantly greater than for untreated TST positives (14.6% versus 2.3%). Although the numbers were small, all of the close contacts who went on to develop active TB were QFT positive, but only 83% were TST positive. As noted above, prior BCG vaccination can produce false positive TST results. In a study of military personnel returning from missions, about one-half of the positive TSTs were falsely positive. In a more recent study of military returning from missions, Franken et al. reported evidence suggesting false positive TST results are common and that QFT testing could guide more targeted treatment and alleviate unnecessary anti-tuberculous treatment. The FDA's cutpoint for a positive result was established at >0.34 International Units/millilitre (IU/ml), though this has proven functionally problematic in low prevalence areas, such as among US and Canadian healthcare workers. In areas of low risk and low prevalence, the positive predictive value of any test is diminished. In the case of serially screened North American healthcare workers, QFT results just above this cutpoint produce false-positive test results that upon repeat testing revert to negative, where tuberculosis screening is often mandated on an annual basis (MMWR June 2010, https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5905a1.htm?s_cid=rr5905a1_e Research at Stanford University and the Veterans Administration has reported the use of a retesting (or borderline) zone below 1.1 IU/ml mitigates 76% of the false-positives, or reversions., Limitations of QFT include the need to draw blood and process it within 16 hours after collection and limited laboratory and clinical experience with the assay. There is need for further study of the utility of QFT in predicting the progression to active tuberculosis, particularly in children and immunocompromised hosts.{Thanassi, 2012 #6} To its disadvantage, QFT can yield false positive results with Mycobacterium szulgai, Mycobacterium kansasii, and Mycobacterium marinum.  QuantiFERON-TB Gold  The QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (QFT-G) is a whole-blood test for use as an aid in diagnosing Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, including latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and tuberculosis (TB) disease. This test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2005. Blood samples are mixed with antigens (substances that can produce an immune response) and controls. For QFT-G, the antigens include mixtures of synthetic peptides representing two M. tuberculosis proteins, ESAT-6 and CFP-10. After incubation of the blood with antigens for 16 to 24 hours, the amount of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is measured. If the patient is infected with M. tuberculosis, their white blood cells will release IFN-gamma in response to contact with the TB antigens. The QFT-G results are based on the amount of IFN-gamma that is released in response to the antigens. Clinical evaluation and additional tests (such as a chest radiograph, sputum smear, and culture) are needed to differentiate between a diagnosis of latent TB or active TB. Advantages of the test are: * Requires a single patient visit to draw a blood sample. * Results can be available within 24 hours. * Does not boost responses measured by subsequent tests, which can happen with tuberculin skin tests (TST). * Is not subject to reader bias that can occur with TST. * Is not affected by prior BCG (bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin) vaccination. Disadvantages and limitations of the test are: * Blood samples must be processed within 16 hours after collection while white blood cells are still viable. * There is limited data on the use of QFT-G in children younger than 17 years of age, among persons recently exposed to M. tuberculosis, and in immunocompromised persons (e.g., impaired immune function caused by HIV infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS], current treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, selected hematological disorders, specific malignancies, diabetes, silicosis, and chronic kidney failure). * Errors in collecting or transporting blood specimens or in running and interpreting the assay can decrease the accuracy of QFT-G. * Limited data on the use of QFT-G to determine who is at risk for developing TB disease.  QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube  On 10/10/2007 the US FDA gave approval for the Quantiferon TB Gold In Tube to be marketed in the US The FDA states: > Approval for a modification of the quantiferon-tb gold to an in-tube > collection system that consists of three blood collection tubes, nil, tb > antigen, and mitogen. The device, as modified, will be marketed under the > trade name quantiferon-tb gold in-tube and is indicated for use as an in > vitro diagnostic test using a peptide cocktail simulating esat-6, cfp-10 and > tb 7.7(p4) proteins to stimulate cells in heparinized whole blood drawn > directly into specialized blood collection tubes. Detection of interferon-y > by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) is used to identify in vitro > responses to these peptide antigens that are associated with mycobacterium > tuberculosis infection. According to the FDA approved package insert Quantiferon TB Gold In Tube has a consistent specificity of >99% in low risk individuals and a sensitivity as high as 92% in individuals with active disease, depending on setting and extent of disease. The specificity in two studies of a few hundred people is 96-98% in a health immunised population. The package insert also advises that the kit provides three collection tubes which have had antigens dried onto their walls and that these tubes must be transferred to an incubator within 16 hours of blood collection. On 25 June 2010, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated the tuberculosis (TB) testing guidelines (MMWR June 2010, https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5905.pdf) providing guidance to US public health officials, clinicians, and laboratory workers regarding screening for and diagnosis of TB infection. The updated guidelines provide new direction for TB control in the US. Previously, QuantiFERON¬Æ-TB Gold was able to be used in any situation in which the Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) was used, without preference. The 2010 guidelines establish a new benchmark because they recommend IGRAs as the preferred TB testing method in many patients, including those who are BCG vaccinated or are unlikely to return for TST reading. Medical facilities in the US using QFT can be found at http://www.quantiferon.com/irm/content/contact-us1.aspx?RID=342. Availability In the United States, the test is widely available from state public health laboratories, hospitals, and commercial laboratories. In January 2008 the CDC advised - via their TB Notes Newsletter \\\\- TB controllers and others of a link to a list of laboratories in the US and Canada offering to perform the Quantiferon Gold test. The California Tuberculosis Controllers Association have also provided a list of public health laboratories in California that are testing with Quantiferon.

Known by his nickname \\"Ben\\" or the altogether more stirring \\"Lion Hitter\\", he was a high-quality all-rounder. Left-handed both as a batsman and bowler, he could bowl either fast roundarm or slow underarm, and he was also a fine fielder. He was born at Ripley, Surrey.  Overview of his playing career  Griffith's first-class career, in which he played primarily for Surrey, lasted from 1856 to 1872. He also played for the United All-England Eleven, including appearing in their prestigious fixtures against the All-England Eleven. Having initially worked as a baker, he played for the Priory Park Club in Chichester until 1856, joining Surrey the following year. He left the staff at the end of the 1863 season because of a disagreement over terms, but he continued to play for the club until 1872.Lemmon, David: The History of Surrey County Cricket Club (Christopher Helm, 1989), , p33.  His finest years  1864 was a great year for George Griffith. Regarded at the time as the biggest hitter in cricket, he played seventeen first-class matches and scored 489 runs. His left-handed round-arm fast bowling was also very highly thought of, and he took 69 wickets that season ‚Äì although some of them came via slow lobs. That figure was supplemented by 26 catches, more than anyone else in the country. The previous season he had been even more successful with the bat, though rather less so with the ball, and made his highest score of 142 against Sussex at Hove.  Overseas tours  Griffith went on two of the earliest overseas tours, the first involved travelling on the SS Great Britainhttps://globalstories.ssgreatbritain.org/_/traveller/8156 with HH Stephenson to Australia in 1861/2 and the second with Edgar Willsher to North America in 1868. No matches on either tour were first-class, with one exception on the former tour, when the touring team divided for a match in March 1862 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground that has been called \\"The World v Surrey XI\\". The six Surrey players from the touring side were joined by five locals, who reportedly had Surrey affiliations, to form the Surrey XI; the World XI was formed of the six non-Surrey tourists and another five locals. Though the Surrey XI lost by 6 wickets, Griffith took 5/52 and 2/37 and scored 39 and 13.Scorecard of The World v Surrey XI During this tour, which was a tremendous all-round success for him, Griffith and his team-mates pitched their tent at Beechworth, where they were to take on a local XXII over the course of three days. The Beechworth players collapsed quickly, however, being bowled out for twenty (twelve ducks), and the match was over long before the allocated time. The third day, therefore, saw Griffith take on a Beechworth XI all on his own. With the aid of three fielders, he dismissed the local side for one run, before scoring the two runs that he required for victory. The locals were naturally dumbfounded. After the chief clash at Castlemain, which the Englishmen lost, Griffith, Lawrence and Iddison recovered some of their dented pride by beating eleven of the locals in another single-wicket match.The 1861-2 tourLord's and Players, an anonymous piece in an 1862 edition of the Temple Bar.  The celebrated hitter  Very popular with the ring at Lord's and, indeed, all other grounds, Griffith was reputed to be the hardest hitter of his time. Edward Eardley-Wilmot and EC Streatfield recalled in their book, Charterhouse: Old and New: \\"Ben Griffiths, with his shoulders high up in his head, hitting merrily left-handedly all over the field\\". The following line of verse also describes him in romantic terms: :\\"If George Griffith gets a loose one, he will send it far away.\\" Harry Altham, in his celebrated book, A History of Cricket, noted that \\"not without cause has the poet sung ... for by common consent he was the hardest hitter known until the time of CI Thornton.\\"Altham, HS: A History of Cricket (George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1948), p. 108. James Pycroft confirms this: \\"Griffiths among the professionals and Mr. Thornton among the gentlemen are the two hardest hitters of my time; I mean in their usual style of play. Griffiths however, never seemed to exert himself or to play for sensational long hits.\\"Pycroft, James: Oxford Memories: A Retrospect After Fifty Years (R. Bentley & Son, 1886), p. 156. W. J. Ford wrote more than once of a vast hit of Griffith's which sailed clean out of The Oval, over the heads of the many Surrey boundary-riders and then over the pavilion. Ford reckoned that, \\"Of the old-time professionals, Griffiths was the biggest hitter I remember.\\"Ford, WJ, in Watson, AET (ed.): The Badminton Magazine of Sports and Pastimes (Longmans, Green, and Co., 1923), p. 58-59. One of his hits, in the 1865 Surrey-Middlesex match at Islington, was measured and found to be 119 yards. 34 years later, it was recalled: \\"A good deal was made of it in the reports at the time, but although, of course, it wasn't nearly equal to many of Thornton's best, I think in the present day you might sit and watch cricket for a long time without seeing a hit as good.\\"Lubbock, Alfred; Lubbock, Robin: Memories of Eton and Etonians (J. Murray, 1899), p. 273. Griffith also once hit all four balls (although Ford mistakenly wrote about six) of an over right out of the Hastings ground in 1864, when playing for a United Eleven. Standing at the ground's northernmost wicket, Griffith bludgeoned each of the deliveries into exactly the same spot, clean over the fence to the Goods Station Road tavern on the right-hand side of the ground, each of them counting as \\"lost\\" sixes. The unfortunate bowler was slow bowler Farmer Bennett of Kent‚Äîbut his mood was in stark contrast to that of the crowd, recorded by the Hastings & St Leonards Observer to have been \\"in a state of high excitement at such an unprecedented circumstance. General and oft-repeated applause showed the warmth of feeling that existed.\\" A hat was passed around at the end of the game and a large collection taken for Griffith's benefit. As the game was not a first-class match, his feat did not count as a record, but, as Pycroft recalled, \\"This we never knew equalled\\".Lemmon, David: The History of Surrey County Cricket Club (Christopher Helm, 1989), , p28.Alfred Lubbock and Robin Lubbock, Memories of Eton and Etonians, J.

After his playing days  He umpired 24 first-class matches between 1869 and 1876, and ran the Talbot Tap public house, adjoining the Talbot Hotel in the High Street, Ripley.

The game is similar to the likes of The Legend of Zelda and Secret of Mana and borrows many ideas from these games, such as a top-down perspective and gameplay focused on exploration, combat, and puzzle- solving. Gameplay elements include large dungeons, fighting and puzzles. It has a whimsical manga-inspired look that makes use of both 3D and 2D graphics. The plot is centered around Monkey, the goofy top-knotted main character. Monkey is sent to the Waking Realm to defeat the Nightmare King and under the guidance of Master Sage, must reclaim all of the pieces of the Magic Storybook. The various pieces of the Magic Storybook are displayed on an in game map. Story The game begins outside a mine with Monkey's friend, friend Tiger. She asks Monkey to take a cart into the mine. Monkey obliges, and while in the mine, an unexpected explosion causes Monkey to fall to the lower levels of the mine. Monkey finds a treasure chest with a bamboo staff in, which becomes his main weapon for the rest of the game. Monkey eventually finds his way out of the mine, and then meets Master Sage, Monkey's teacher. He gives Monkey a headband that allows for them to communicate over long distances. Master Sage asks Monkey to travel to the library to stop the Nightmare King from stealing the Magic Storybook. The Nightmare King has invaded the Waking Realm and upset the balance, and it's up to Monkey to remove the Nightmares and restore the balance. Monkey goes through many dungeons and catacombs such as a graveyard crawling with zombies and ghosts, a mountain called Dragon Mountain and even the heart of a crashed alien space craft. He also has to deal with one of his friends thinking of betraying him to arm the Nightmares with a new weapon. Characters *Monkey - The main character, he has appeared from the dream realm to restore the balance. He is friendly and easy to get along with, and is well known throughout the waking Realm. *Master Sage - Master Sage is Monkey's teacher. He provides Monkey with information throughout the game, and provides tutorials and tips throughout the game. He also supplies the player with new weapons and tells stories about Monkey's past. He wears a blue cloak and has long grey hair. *Dream King - The Dream King is the leader of the Dream world and has a direct influence into the Waking realm. He may be related to Monkey but that is found out at the end of the game. *Nightmare King - The leader of the Nightmare World and the main villain in the game, he resembles a roach and is the first boss fight in the game. He leads all of the nightmares in the game. Gameplay The player's health is measured in peaches. When certain tasks are performed, the player can acquire big peaches, which increase overall health. In a similar fashion to games in The Legend of Zelda series, the player collects equipment and magical items that allow them to progress past a variety of hazards and obstructions in the game's world. These items are often found in \\"dungeon\\" areas - contained areas with a specific focus on the particular obstacle that the item allows the player to resolve. At the end of each dungeon there is a boss that must be defeated in order to complete the dungeon. There are three realms, as underlined in the manual: the Dream Realm, the Nightmare Realm, and the Waking Realm. Development The game's story and many of the characters were inspired by Chinese legends. Huge anime fans, developers Jeronimo Barrera and Jay Minn hired artists from the comic book industry and gave them a number of anime and kung fu films for reference. Technical director Greg Marquez wrote a development tool specifically for the game called MOPA (Map Objects Puzzle Attributes), which enabled designers to snap large 3D objects together using 2D tile representations. Blam! had plans to port the game to Microsoft Windows, but these never came to fruition. The game is notorious for being one of the few games that has never been able to be emulated properly on PlayStation 1 emulators or on PlayStation 2 due to various programming quirks implemented in development. Reception The game received \\"unfavorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.

History Alfred is on State Highway 359 twelve miles (19 km) northeast of Alice in northeastern Jim Wells County. The community was founded in 1888, when the site was in Nueces County, and was originally named Driscoll. A post office was established there in 1890. In 1904, when the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway built through the Robert Driscoll ranch to the east, Driscoll wanted the station to be named after himself. Since there could not be two post offices with the same name, N. T. Wright, the postmaster of old Driscoll, agreed to change the name of his post office to Alfred, in honor of his father, Alfred Wright, the first postmaster of the community. The Texas and New Orleans Railroad built through the area in 1907. In 1912 a school district was formed there, and in 1914 the town had a population of fifty, a general store, and six cattle breeders. The population of Alfred peaked in 1927, when it was estimated at 300. In 1936 Alfred comprised a school, several dwellings, and surrounding farms. During the 1940s and 1950s the community's population continued to decrease, and by 1969 it was estimated at twenty. In 1979 and 1990 Alfred was a dispersed rural community with a population of ten.

It was named after Andrej Vr√°bel (1910‚Äì1991), a Slovak math teacher. History The school began operating on November 5, 1815 with an initial enrollment of 135 students. It quickly gained a good reputation throughout the region. The main building survives from this time, though the two wings of the school were not built until the late 20th century to provide more space for classrooms and facilities. Currently the building supports approximately twenty classes and laboratories. Originally, the main language of instruction at the school was Latin. After the revolutions of 1848 and 1849, the Austrian Government ordered the school to instruct its students in either Hungarian or German. Unable to continue operating under these conditions, the school declared bankruptcy in 1850. One year later, it reopened, but originally only offered reduced programs of study to prospective students. On 8 June 1885, with a budget of 47,000 gold-coins, the cornerstone for a new building to accommodate burgeoning levels of enrollment was laid. The school's facilities survived both World Wars, and it was used as a hospital throughout those periods. In 1945, reconstruction and renovation of the school began.

A native of Wichita, Kansas, Lock attended Kingman High School in Kingman, Kansas and then attended what is now Wichita State University. He stood (1.88 m) tall and weighed 202 pounds (92 kg), and threw and batted right-handed. Lock signed with the New York Yankees in 1958 but never appeared in an MLB game for the Yanks. Instead, he was recalled from the Triple-A Richmond Virginians on July 11, 1962, and immediately traded to Washington for veteran first baseman and pinch hitter Dale Long. Lock played left field for Washington that season, but by early he became the Senators' regular center fielder, supplanting the colorful Jimmy Piersall, who was traded to the New York Mets. His two most productive seasons were and , when he hit 27 and 28 home runs and drove home 82 and 80 runs batted in respectively. Lock led American League center fielders in put-outs, assists and double plays turned in 1963, and all AL outfielders in assists the following year. As a batter, he finished second in the league in strikeouts in both 1963 and 1964. Overall, Lock appeared in 921 games over eight seasons, batting .238 with 122 home runs and 373 RBI. He managed in the Red Sox farm system for two seasons (1971‚Äì72, with the Winston-Salem Red Sox and Pawtucket Red Sox), and in part of 1973 for the Wilson Pennants, a co-op team in the Carolina League, after his playing career ended.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1954 to 1966 for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati Reds. He was born in Bay City, Michigan. After two years of military service, he made his Major League debut at age 23 on April 15, 1954 in a 7-4 Pirates' loss to the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field. Starting in right field and batting third, he had one hit in four at bats. In his first three at-bats he flied out twice and struck out once against Dodgers pitcher Russ Meyer. His first career hit came in the ninth inning off Meyer, as he singled and also drove in his first two runs. Lynch helped the Reds win the 1961 National League pennant. On September 26, 1961, he propelled the Reds into the World Series with his two-run home run off Cubs pitcher Bob Anderson, scoring Vada Pinson. He finished 22nd in voting for the 1961 NL MVP. He was hitless in three official at bats and four plate appearances during the 1961 World Series, which the Reds lost in five games to the New York Yankees. Lynch in 1961 Lynch is considered one of baseball's all-time best pinch hitters. He had 116 pinch hits during his career, which ranks him 10th on the all-time list. Lynch is third on the all-time pinch hit home run list (he was first when he retired) with 18, with five of those coming during the 1961 season while driving in 25 runs. Lynch was once quoted as saying, \\"The good pinch- hitter is the guy who can relax enough to get the pitch he can hit. You almost always do get one pitch to hit every time you bat. So you have to have the patience to wait. And then you've got to be able to handle the pitch when you get it.\\" In 13 seasons, he played in 1,184 games with 2,879 at bats, 364 runs, 798 hits, 123 doubles, 34 triples, 115 home runs, 470 RBI, 224 walks, .277 batting average, .329 on-base percentage, .463 slugging percentage and 1,334 total bases. After his baseball career ended, Lynch partnered with former Pirates teammate Dick Groat to operate the Champion Lakes Golf Course in Ligonier, Pennsylvania. He retired to the Atlanta, Georgia area in the late 1980s. Lynch died on March 31, 2012 at age 81 in Austell, Georgia. He was survived by his wife Alice, sons Mark, Keith and Gerald, and daughter Kimberly.

From 971 to 981, Gisilher was the Bishop of the new see of Merseburg. When he was elevated to the archdiocese in that latter year, however, he suppressed the Merseburg bishopric on the basis that its creation (967 or 968) had not received the written consent of the Diocese of Halberstadt. In 981, the Diocese of Merseburg was united to that of Magdeburg. It was only separated on Gisilher's death. The archbishop had the support of the Bishops of Zeitz and Meissen, who wished to aggrandise their own dioceses. In 983, the Slavic tribes bordering eastern Saxony rebelled. Havelberg and Brandenburg were destroyed and the March of Zeitz devastated. In August, the margraves of Meissen, Lusatia, and the Nordmark joined with the troops of the Bishop of Halberstadt under the leadership of Gisilher and defeated the Slavs at Belkesheim, near Stendal. Nevertheless, the Germans were once again limited to the land west of the Elbe. In March 984, Gisilher hosted Henry II, Duke of Bavaria, in Magdeburg on Palm Sunday. He supported Henry for the regency of the young Emperor Otto III and perhaps even as king, for Henry received the commendation of the magnates at Magdeburg. On his death in 1004, there followed a brief conflict between King Henry II and the cathedral canons before Tagino was installed as archbishop.

The mountain is nearly completely encircled by the town of Banff and the Banff Springs Hotel grounds. For many Indigenous people, the Buffalo is not sleeping anymore since Banff National Park reintroduced wild bison in 2017. Etymology buffalo. The Blackfoot name for the mountain is Iinii Istako and the Stoney Nakoda language name is Eyarhey Tatanga Woweyahgey Wak√¢n. The Stoney people called it \\"Sleeping Buffalo\\" for a long time, as it resembles a sleeping buffalo when viewed from the north and east. In 1858, James Hector named the small peak \\"The Hill\\", likely in reference to its status as the smallest peak adjacent to the Banff townsite. In the 1880s Canadian Pacific Railway surveyors had first considered blasting a tunnel through the mountain for the tracks through the Bow Valley. Even though they discovered another route for the train and the tunnel idea was abandoned, the name Tunnel Mountain stuck. In September 2016, fifteen First Nations signed a resolution calling for the beginning of an official process with the Natural Resources Canada's Geographical Names Board of Canada to rename Tunnel Mountain, Sacred Buffalo Guardian Mountain. At their November 2017 \\"Indigenous Leaders' Dialogue\\" in Banff, representatives granted the name, Sacred Buffalo Guardian Mountain ceremonially as they await the decision of the NRC. The fire lookout on top of the mountain began to be known as \\"King's Lookout,\\" following a Royal Tour in 1939 when King George VI and Queen Elizabeth climbed to the lookout. History Sulphur Mountain, with Bow River in foreground and the CP railway and Trans-Canada Highway in the background In 1882, a team of surveyors led by Major A.B. Rogers, of Rogers Pass fame, was surveying for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Rogers, likely in a hurry, assumed the easiest path for the railway to take would be to simply follow the Bow River. On account of the difficulties that would be faced with river crossings and the steepness of the cliffs between the northwestern edge of Mount Rundle and Tunnel Mountain, Rogers' team suggested the construction of a tunnel through the tiny mountain. CPR General Manager William Cornelius Van Horne was furious at the suggestion, exclaiming \\"Are we going to hold up this railway for a year and a half while they build their damned tunnel? Take it out!\\" An alternative route north of the mountain was found, which incidentally shortened the railway by a mile, and avoided two long hills, saving the CPR millions of dollars. Surveyor Charles Shaw described the idea as \\"the most extraordinary blunder I have ever known in the way of engineering.\\" The idea of a tunnel was scrapped altogether, but the mountain is still called Tunnel Mountain to this day. Hiking Tunnel Mountain, likely due to its easy grade and location in the heart of Banff, is a very popular hike. The trail has a gentle grade for most of the way, with a few mildly steep sections, and is only round-trip. The top offers a panoramic view of the townsite, the Bow valley and the surrounding wilderness, and many recommend it as an easy introductory hike to the area. The mountain has also drawn praise from many famous mountaineers. James Outram, the first person to climb Mount Assiniboine climbed Tunnel in 1900, commenting \\"the view will never be forgotten.\\" Arthur O. Wheeler, co-founder of the Alpine Club of Canada also praised the view: Perhaps the most devout admirer of the mountain was Anne Ness, a local resident. Anne climbed Tunnel Mountain over 8000 times over a 40-year period, averaging 200 ascents a year. Ness was even known to climb the mountain twice a day; once during lulls in her job, and a second in the evening. Famed wildlife artist Carl Rungius had his ashes scattered on the mountain, as he loved the view of Banff and the Bow Valley.

It reflects Sting's childhood fondness for TV Westerns, as well as his avowed interest in country music, but also tackles deeper and more philosophical themes of life, death, justice and redemption. It tells the story of a boy who shoots a stranger (possibly by accident), the resulting shame, and the consequences he faces. Blue Highway released a bluegrass version of the song in 1999 on their self-titled album Blue Highway. In 2002, Johnny Cash covered the song in the album American IV: The Man Comes Around. Sting re-recorded the song in an orchestral version for his 2010 album Symphonicities. Theme The story is told from the point of view of a young man who takes his brother's rifle out with him one morning. He points the rifle at a man who is riding a horse in the distance (\\"I drew a bead on him; to practice my aim.\\") The rifle discharges, killing the rider. The man runs to the salt lands, throwing the rifle into a stream. (The Cash cover changes \\"salt lands\\" to \\"south lands\\", and \\"stream\\" to \\"sheen\\". Sting supposed the latter was due to a misprint in the lyrics Cash was using. ) He is discovered by a sheriff, and is struck by the realization of what he has done. He is brought before a judge and jury, where he begs forgiveness and wishes he were dead. Awaiting execution on the gallows, he sees as a \\"trick of the brain\\" the rider return, so that they will ride together \\"till kingdom come\\". The man prays to God for mercy. Compositional structure The song is one of very few popular tunes written in compound time . It makes use of the Bulgarian aksak rhythm Grancharsko horo which is bichronal meaning it has the effect of alternating groups of 4- and 5-beat bars. The drum beat is syncopated, on the 3rd and 8th beats. In the Johnny Cash cover, the signature of the song was changed to standard . In Sting's version of the song, the song is in the key of B‚ô≠ major. The guitar part is played with a capo on the 1st fret. Appearances Johnny Cash's cover version of the song was used in the Season Six premiere of The Shield, and was played over the opening and closing of the episode. The episode dealt with the aftermath (guilt, recriminations and anger) of the murder of a central character by his partner, who mistakenly believed that the victim had betrayed him. Bruce Springsteen covered the song at the 2014 Kennedy Center Honors where Sting was one of the honorees.

He played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball as an outfielder and first baseman.  Early baseball career  Biittner was originally drafted by the Washington Senators in the 10th round of the 1968 amateur draft, and would go on to play several different positions, including all three outfield positions, first base and designated hitter. On December 20, 1973, the Rangers traded Biittner to the Montreal Expos for Pat Jarvis. On May 17, 1976, the Expos traded Biittner and Steve Renko to the Chicago Cubs for Andre Thornton. Work as a pitcher  On July 4, 1977, Biittner's Chicago Cubs were swept in a double-header by the Montreal Expos. Biittner had thrown three innings during a Cub exhibition game at triple-A Wichita in May 1977, and he had been told to by then-Cubs manager Herman Franks to be ready to pitch in the event of a blowout. Indeed, in the first game of the July 4 double-header, Biittner was brought into the game in the eighth inning with the Expos leading 11-2 and two men on base. Biittner threw a called strike and a ball to the first batter he faced, Larry Parrish. Then, Parrish swung and missed. Finally, on a 1-2 pitch, Parrish hit a three-run home run to deep left field, making the score 14-2. Biittner then struck out the Expos' starter, Jackie Brown to end the inning. In the ninth inning, Biittner walked the Expos' Dave Cash and then retired Chris Speier. Then, Ellis Valentine homered to left to make the game 16-2. Biittner then gave up two more singles and served up a third home run to Andre Dawson. In total, Biittner yielded up six earned runs and striking out three in 1-1/3 innings pitched.  Later career  Biittner was a good contact hitter. His best season came with the Cubs in 1977 when he played in a career-high 138 games, hit 28 doubles and batted .298. In October 1980, Biittner filed for free agency. On January 12, 1981, he signed as a free agent with the Cincinnati Reds. He played for the Reds for two seasons until he was released in December 1982. Biittner's role in the second half of his career was as a pinch-hitter and he became quite successful, finishing 12th all-time in total pinch hits at the end of his career with 95. Biittner was also the first free agent signed by the Reds. Cincinnati famously avoided signing free agents during the late '70s before finally jumping in with the Biittner signing in 1981. Later in December 1982, the Texas Rangers signed Biittner as a free agent. After one season with the Rangers, Biittner was released on October 31, 1983. In 1217 games over 14 seasons, Biittner posted a .273 batting average (861-for-3151) with 310 runs, 29 home runs, 354 RBI and 236 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .985 fielding percentage playing at first base and all three outfield positions.

A former outfielder born in Clarksdale, Mississippi, he appeared in 533 games over all or part of seven seasons in Major League Baseball for the Baltimore Orioles (, and ) and Washington Senators (‚Äì). He also played one season for the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball in 1970. Valentine was a switch hitter who threw right-handed; he was listed as tall and . Valentine attended Tennessee State University and signed with Baltimore in 1956. After completing four seasons in the Orioles' farm system, he was called to Baltimore for his first MLB trial during the final month of the 1959 season. In limited service (12 games total, with seven starts in the outfield), he batted .316 with two multi-hit games. He then returned to the top level of minor league baseball, and would not get his second chance with the Orioles until his recall in June 1963. Again, he played sparingly (getting into only 26 games), but he batted .268 as a backup outfielder and pinch hitter. His contract was then sold to the Senators in October. In 1964, Valentine finally spent extended time on a big-league roster, getting into 102 games and substituting in all three outfield positions. But he struggled offensively, hitting only .226, and was demoted to Triple-A Hawaii for . Fortunately, he had a banner season with the Islanders, slugging 25 home runs, batting .324, and leading the Pacific Coast League in runs scored (116), earning him a September callup with the Senators. That campaign led to Valentine's career-best season, in . He played in 146 games, starting 127 of them as either Washington's center fielder or right fielder. At the plate, he set personal bests in home runs (16) and runs batted in (59), while hitting a robust .276, second on the team to slugger Frank Howard's .278. He led the Senators in runs scored (77), hits (140) and doubles (29). Then, in , Valentine returned for another season as the Senators' \\"fourth\\" outfielder: he played in 150 games in all, and got into 136 games as an outfielder with 111 starts, most of these coming in center and right fields. However, his offensive production fell off in every category, as he hit .234 with 11 home runs. Returning to Washington in 1968, he appeared in 26 games in the outfield during the season's first two months. But he again struggled at the plate, batting .238, and Washington sent him back to the Orioles at the June 15 trade deadline for pitcher Bruce Howard. Valentine then concluded his MLB career as a reserve outfielder, hitting only .187 for Baltimore. On the cusp of winning three straight American League pennants (1969‚Äì1971), Baltimore outrighted Valentine to Triple-A Rochester for 1969. That season, the 34-year-old enjoyed one last productive minor-league campaign, hitting .287 with 18 homers. He then played a final year of professional baseball in Japan, where he batted .246 with 11 long balls for Hanshin. All told, Valentine batted .247 in major league action, collecting 360 hits, with 56 career doubles, ten triples and 36 homers. He had 168 runs batted in.

It was designed by Steve Turner for the ZX Spectrum. Plot In Quazatron, the player-controlled droid (KLP-2 \\"Klepto\\", from the Classical Greek Œ∫ŒªŒµœÄœÑœâ, steal) attempts to destroy all the other robots in the underground citadel of Quazatron and subsequent locations. Gameplay Klepto in Quazatron; R8 Repair Drone and B7 Battle Drone patrol nearby. Klepto is maneuvered across individual levels of Quazatron, which can be navigated between via a system of lifts. Levels may include floors at different heights, ramps, information points, recharge points and patrolling robots. It is Klepto's aim to destroy all the other robots, whereupon the lighting on that level is deactivated. This can be done by damaging them with a ranged weapon, by ramming into them and/or causing them to fall from a height, or by a successful grapple attempt. Each robot has a two-character identifier which provides information about its parts and role. 'X' denotes a menial robot, 'U' for utility, 'R' for repair, 'B' for battle, 'L' for logic, 'S' for security and 'C' for command. The number is a ranking system, with lower numbers denoting better parts. '9' is a 'device', '8' or '7' for a drone, '6' or '5' for a robot, '4' or '3' for a droid, '2' or '1' for a cyborg. This ranking also determines the robot's security rating from Epsilon to Alpha. Security rating determines the level of access from information points. In addition are several special identifiers; 'OO Medic Droid', 'A1 Automaton', 'ST Programmer' and 'AB Andrewoid'. (The last two being plays on Steve Turner & Andrew Braybrook's names.) The grapple system in Quazatron To grapple another robot, Klepto must make contact with it with the grapple activated. This initiates a sub-game in which both parties must light sections at the centre of a circuit board using a limit number of power supplies. Should Klepto win, the player may attempt to salvage parts from the destroyed enemy, with a more dominating victory providing less damaged equipment. Salvaging robot parts in Quazatron Parts include: *Power (ranging from the initial Chemifax Mk1 to the Cybonic Mk2), which provides power to all components, but more powerful units weigh more. *Drive (ranging from Linear Mk1 to Ultragrav), which consumes power but determines a robots speed. Overall speed is also reduced by the weight of all the parts. *Chassis (ranging from Duralite to Coralloy Mk2) which determines a robots ability to take damage, but may consume power and has weight. *Weapon (ranging from a Pulse Laser to a Disruptor) which consumes power and has weight. *Devices have extra weight and may consume power. Detector displays active levels on the map screen. Overdrive provides extra drive, whilst Powerboost provides extra power. Laser Shields and Disruptor Shields provide extra defence against certain weapons. Ram Thruster causes extra damage when ramming. If Klepto is sufficiently damaged, it will lose all acquired parts and be left with its default loadout. The player must then seek immediate repairs or risk losing the game completely. Klepto's damage level is denoted by the expression on his face, rather than an energy bar. These facial expressions, including eye blinks and looks, were inspired by Andrew Braybrook's animation techniques for Gribbly's Day Out. When the first location, Quazatron, has been completely cleared, Klepto proceeds to the next citadel, Beebatron (a reference to a rival microcomputer, the BBC Model B or \\"Beeb\\"). Subsequent citadels, Commodo and Amstrados, are also named after microcomputers of the era. History Quazatron was a Spectrum version of Paradroid, which was written by Graftgold partner Andrew Braybrook in 1985. Although a direct conversion was considered, it was felt that the Spectrum couldn't handle screen-scrolling as smoothly as the Commodore 64. However, Steve Turner had been working on an isometric landscape engine for the Spectrum called Ziggurat and decided to use this with the Paradroid game mechanics, control system and patrol paths. This new isometric perspective (drawing visual comparisons with Marble Madness) also provided an additional gameplay aspect ‚Äì opposing droids could be pushed off edges in order to damage them. =Reception= Your Sinclair reviewed the game in issue 6, awarding 9 out of 10, with reviewer Phil South highlighting the original scenario and combination of strategy and action. CRASH was similarly impressed, awarding 94% in issue 29 and highlighting the graphics, sound effects, playability and addictiveness. Sinclair User awarded the game a 'Sinclair User Classic' award in their May 1986 issue. In their issue 51 retrospective, CRASH concluded that Quazatron was a successful fusion of arcade action and strategy, superior to the original Paradroid. One common criticism was with the game's \\"slow and jerky\\" screen scrolling, despite Hewson claiming that problem would be fixed by the game's release. The ZX Spectrum version was voted number 19 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time. Ports and sequels Quazatron was followed by a 1988 sequel, Magnetron. The same game concept can be seen in Ranarama (1987), a game from the same author that appeared between Quazatron and Magnetron. Quazatron has also provided inspiration for several PC remakes.

It is affiliated to the Ulster Branch of the Irish Hockey Association and was founded in 1951. The first team currently plays in the Premier League of the Ulster Senior League and are current holders of the Irish Senior Cup. In addition the club also fields five Junior League teams and two ladies' teams. The ladies' team currently play in the second tier of Ulster Hockey in senior league section one. Early years From their foundation in 1951, Cookstown gained promotion from the Junior League to Intermediate League Section A of the Ulster Senior League in season 1954-55. A period of consolidation followed before Cookstown started to progress upwards in the ranks of Ulster hockey. In 1966-67 Intermediate League Section A was finally won to gain entry to Qualifying League Section B. The following season saw their league won again and promotion to Qualifying League Section A. When the Ulster Senior League was re-organised after the 1968-69 season, Cookstown had performed well enough in their first season in Qualifying League Section A to secure a place in the new Section 2. For the next five seasons Cookstown proved to be one of the stronger teams in the Section, but always fell just short of promotion to the top flight of Ulster hockey. Season 1974-75 finally brought the long-awaited win of Section 2 and Cookstown secured their place in the top flight of the Ulster Senior League. Their position in the top Section of the League has been retained continuously from that date. 1980s The 1980s was a period of success for the club and saw Cookstown experience European competition for the first time. In 1979-80 the club fought its way through to the Irish Senior Cup Final for the first time, losing to Belfast YMCA by two goals to nil. The disappointment was tempered when their opponents were unable to represent Ireland in the European Club Cup as participation would involve playing on a Sunday and Cookstown accepted an invitation to take their place. Cookstown won a qualifying tournament and went on to the main event in Rome. They won the Final on penalty-flicks. They became the first Club in Ireland to win a major European competition. In 1983 the club won the Ulster Senior League Section 1 for the first time in their history. They made it a double by also winning the Anderson Cup. The Irish Senior Cup came to Cookstown for the first time in 1986-87. As underdogs they beat Banbridge 4-0 at Blaris, in the last Final to be played on a real grass pitch. In 1988, as a result of their Irish Senior Cup success, Cookstown were again in European competition and finished 7th in the Premier section of the tournament held in the Netherlands. The only major trophy that had eluded Cookstown, the Kirk Cup, was finally won in 1988-89 when Mossley were beaten by one goal to nil at Blaris. The 2nd team also joined the trophy winning when they won two Irish Junior Cups in 1983 and 1985. 1990 onwards The successes of the 1980s were hard to follow and a long barren spell ensued before a return to success with the capture of the Kirk Cup in 2002-03 and 2006-07. The club attained their best league position since the eighties, when they finished second in 2006-07. A winner-takes-all game against the eventual winners Annadale in the last fixture of the season was lost. A victory would have won the league for Cookstown. In the 2007-08 season, Cookstown captured the Premier League for the second time in their history. The premier league title was retained in the 2008-09 season and the Kirk Cup was also secured. The Premier League and Kirk Cup double was repeated in 2009-10. The league title was lost in 2010-11. However, a 24-year wait came to an end when Cookstown once again won the Irish Senior Cup in 2011 by defeating Monkstown by four goals to three in the final.

On the day of the meeting, both an armed naval ship and a small unarmed boat from the ship went out to meet the Moro pirates. Before the Moro's boats would come closer, the ship had to depart the scene and leave the small boat alone to meet the pirates. Brent and his co-worker, Mrs. Lorillard Spencer, were in the boat unarmed. Some of the pirates jumped into the small boat \\"heavily armed and Plotting murder.\\" Brent stood up, threw his penknife down on the deck.

With the money he had raised and with the measure of confidence effected by his meeting with the pirates, Brent was able to begin his mission to the Moros. In 1905, he dedicated the Mission of the Holy Trinity, Zamboanga on the island of Mindanao. The mission provided \\"the first contact\\" between the Episcopal Church's missionaries of the Moro people. Converting the Moro Muslim was so difficult that Brent decided to try \\"an indirect approach.\\" By 1914, a hospital had been built. The hospital was located at Zamboanga City.

He believed that these faith and order issues had to be dealt with before genuine unity could be achieved. Therefore, during the conference, he proposed \\"a conference on the faith and order of the church\\" which would address these issues. After returning to the United States, as a follow-up, he presented his proposal to the Episcopal church's 1910 General Convention.

During his time with the Cowley fathers in Boston, Brent was assigned to \\"St. Augustine's Mission for Negroes.\\" It was \\"an early schooling\\" for Brent \\"in the spiritual care of colored folk\\" as preparation for working with people of other races in the Philippines. This ministry also increased \\"his conviction that the Christian Gospel could overcome all the human divisions of race and culture.\\"Alexander C. Zabriskie, Bishop Brent: Crusader for Christian Unity (Westminster Press, 1948), 28‚Äì29. After his assignment at St. Augustine's, Brent had ministered ten years (1891‚Äì1901) as assistant minister at St. Stephen's Mission, Boston. During his ten years at St. Stephen's, he came to believe in \\"the essential value of every man, of whatever race or color or creed.\\" In the Philippines, this belief was deepened. He wrote that \\"it was among the pagan peoples that I learned that equality before God of all men, which I count to be the chief treasure I have honestly made my own in my life time.\\"Trinity College School Record October 1946-August 1947 (Trinity College School, 1946), 5‚Äì6.

It is a pressing necessity for the arousing of that passion for Christ which will be the most flaming thing in the world, that certainty of voice and touch which will quell honest doubt and perplexity, that fund of wisdom which will open up spiritual vistas such as now we only yearn for.\\" =Work for Episcopal Church colleges= By the end of the first World War, there were only five Episcopal colleges out of the \\"great many\\" which the Episcopal Church had established. Because of their \\"meager enrollments\\" and \\"financial difficulties,\\" it seemed that they would probably soon close. Brent was \\"determined that this would not be.\\" At this time, Brent's had two priorities. One was church unity, which he pursued until his death. The other was doing what he could to overcome the separation in America \\"between secular education and the Christian religion\\" by trying to convince the Episcopal Church to give financial support to its five remaining colleges.

Brent said that he would like to keep up his effort but that he knew he \\"had not long to live.\\" =Reflections on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his consecration= In 1926, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his consecration as bishop, Brent wrote, \\"For three things I am deeply grateful‚Äîthat I am Canadian born and bred, that I had a mother who for character and spiritual culture was the peer of the best, and that a country rectory, where my father served for forty-two years, sheltered my young days. From my Canadian breeding I got that fine, just discipline, which held within bounds a nature that could easily have gone on the rocks; to my mother's wise and loving influence I owe all the good that is in me; and it was my father's long rectorate in the little village where I was born that burned into my soul the high value of stability.\\"Alexander C.

The administrative centre was formerly at Akodo and was later moved to Igando Oloja due to the creation of Lekki Council Development Area. The name of the Local government was derived from two autonomous communities, Ibeju and Lekki. The demographics of the area include Yoruba speaking natives although there are a lot of people from different parts of the country living, working and doing business in the area. Ibeju Lekki has potential for tourism as it is endowed with beautiful lagoon views and ocean fronts. The development in the area is rapid and ongoing, some even refer to the area as the new Lagos. The commercial center of Lagos state seems to be shifting gradually towards the area with much effort being put into developing industries and infrastructure. Ibeju-Lekki is one of the LGAs for planned Lekki City. With the actualization of the blueprint, Ibeju Lekki is expected to become a central hub for business, manufacturing, warehousing, and logistics. Forecasts have been made about an increase in commercial activities in the area as a result of these developments which will create thousands of jobs and make the area a major business location in the country. In Ibeju Lekki, there are on-going and proposed industrial developments such as the Dangote Refinery which is expected to be the world‚Äôs biggest single-train facility and estimated to cost $9bn. It covers a total area of 2,635ha on the Lekki Free Zone near the Lekki Lagoon, enabling easy shipment of refined petroleum products to international markets. The refinery is expected to double Nigeria‚Äôs refining capacity, largely to accommodate the pressing demand for fuel and export to foreign markets in and out of Africa. A fertilizer plant is also included in the refinery complex, to fully utilize the raw materials released from the refinery. Also, there is the Lekki International Airport project which was initiated to lessen the pressure on the Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMIA) in Ikeja. The master plan of the new airport shows that it‚Äôs designed to cater for wide-body, double-deck, and four-engine aircraft with the capacity for up to 500 seats. For a start, the Airbus A380 is expected to carry two million to five million passengers per annum with future prospects of expansion to cater to the increasing aviation needs of the rapidly developing Lekki area and its environs. There is also the Pan-African_University, Lekki Deap Seaport, Lekki International Golf Course and Eleganza Industries. These are among the many other industrial developments at Ibeju-Lekki.

Their early focus was on tracking campaign contributions in Texas and elsewhere, including contributions to George W. Bush's campaign in the 2000 and 2004 US presidential elections. The group lodged the original complaints which led to the now overturned conviction of former US Representative Tom Delay, as well as former Texas Governor Rick Perry's August 2014 felony indictment. It has been accused of being \\"funded by out-of-state foundations and rich individuals to specialize in \\"lawfare\\" against state officials of whose policies they disapprove\\". Craig McDonald, a Michigan native, founded the organization and is its current Director. He began his career on the political left via the public interest movement in the late-1970s working as a community organizer. Working for Ralph Nader's Public Citizen activist group in 1984, he went on to create the Texas office of Public Citizen in that same year. According to TPJ, its board of directors includes, in addition to McDonald, two other veterans of Nader's Public Citizen; a former aide to the late Texas Democratic Gov. Ann Richards who was also a Clinton-Gore organizer; and a journalist who \\"has written for numerous progressive publications.\\" McDonald claims that TPJ only reveals its institutional funders and doesn't reveal its individual supporters for fear of political retaliation. He said he doesn't consider that policy in conflict with the group's work in highlighting the impact of money in politics.

It is the largest local government in Lagos, with 1,288,714 inhabitants, according to the official 2006 Census (however, the Lagos State Government disputes the official Census figures and claims a population within the LGA of more than 2 million residents). It has now been subdivided between several Local Community Development Areas (LCDA). The LCDA restructuring kicked off after the administration of Bola Ilori, who was the last chairman of the old single Alimosho Local Government. The six sub-divisions created out of the old Alimosho are: Agbado/Oke-odo LCDA, Ayobo/Ipaja LCDA, Alimosho LG, Egbe/Idimu LCDA, Ikotun/Igando LCDA and Mosan Okunola LCDA. The LGA contains the urban area of Egbeda/Akowonjo. The Alimosho was established in 1945 and it was under the (then) western region. Alimosho's population is predominantly Egbados. The area is rich in culture, prominent amongst which are the Oro, Igunnu and Egungun annual festivals. The two main religions are Islam and Christianity. Yoruba language is widely spoken in the community. The source of Alimosho is Alashua River, which is located on the axis of Oki and Alaguntan in Alimosho. The most recognised Baale is late Chief Kokumo follow by Lateef Sekoni, while the present Baale is Afuwape. The royal family includes Folarin, Kokumo, Ogunbowale and Afuwape. The Central Mosque in Alimosho is the 3rd Mosque in Lagos after the Badagry Central Mosque and the Lagos Central Mosque. The First court is now known as Alimosho Town Hall, which is not recognized anymore by the incumbent government, and the Baale of Alimosho, which is not also recognized by the government due to political reason. The first secretariat of Alimosho is a two-storey building located on Council street, now in the Egbe/Idimu LCDA.

Following charges about the conduct of his officers at Gettysburg, Rowley was tried by a court martial that was later declared biased, and he was reinstated. Early life Rowley was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He served as a captain of volunteers in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, mustered in on October 8, 1847, and mustered out on July 18, 1848. Otherwise, he worked as a cabinetmaker. Civil War service Rowley served as colonel of the 13th Pennsylvania Infantry from April 25, 1861, to August 6 of the same year. He then became colonel of the 102nd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He was wounded at the Battle of Seven Pines, while leading his regiment in the Army of the Potomac. He (briefly) led a brigade in VI Corps at the Battle of Fredericksburg. Promoted to the rank of brigadier general to rank from November 29, 1862, Rowley next commanded a brigade of I Corps at the Battle of Chancellorsville. He was acting commander of 3rd Division, I Corps at the beginning of the Battle of Gettysburg, while Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday was acting corps commander. (Chapman Biddle led Rowley's brigade.) On July 1, 1863, the brigade suffered heavy casualties confronting Confederates from Maj. Gen. Harry Heth's division. He was thrown from his horse during the retreat when it stopped short at the creek. Sick with infection from boils the size of hens eggs on his inner thighs, he was feverish, and temperamental. Following a confrontation between Rowley and Brig. Gen. Lysander Cutler over the conduct of some of the 7th Wisconsin officers, Cutler filed charges of drunkenness in April 1864. Given less than 24 hours to prepare a defense for trial, Rowley was convicted by a court martial that author John F. Krumwiede states was, \\"lacking impartiality and marching to its own drum\\". Although reinstated by order of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and President Abraham Lincoln, Rowley was assigned only a district command in western Pennsylvania, due to the ongoing feud between the army commander General George G. Meade and the now corps commander General Gouverneur K. Warren. Blocked by the actions of General Darius N. Couch in the attempt to stop the 1864 invasion of Pennsylvania by Confederate General Jubal Early, he resigned his commission on December 29, 1864.Krumwiede, p. 167.

A cyclic fever may also be associated with other conditions, but it is not called \\"Pel‚ÄìEbstein fever\\" unless the fever is associated with Hodgkin's. Causes The cause is currently unknown although speculation centers on host immune response ‚Äì particularly the cyclical release of cytokines, lymph node necrosis, and damaged stromal cells. Diagnosis Cyclical fevers normally require periodic temperature monitoring to detect, though it is possible one could sense subjective changes in body temperature as well. To count as Pel-Ebstein fever diagnostic workup for Hodgkin's lymphoma would be required as well if that dianosis was not already made. Treatment Treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or treatment of the underlying Hodgkin's (usually with chemotherapy) will help the symptoms. Eponym The condition is named after Wilhelm Ebstein and P. K. Pel who both published papers in 1887 noting the phenomenon. Both doctors published in the same journal, though Pel published first by several months. A long-term dispute persisted between Pel and Ebstein on the etiology of the condition. Controversy Researchers have speculated whether this condition truly exists, since some authorities anecdotally estimate only a 5‚Äì10% occurrence rate.

Later on, he served as professor at the universities of Li√®ge (from 1875) and Prague (from 1878). In 1894 he returned to Vienna, where he succeeded Billroth as director of the second surgical university clinic.Gussenbauer, Carl Ignatz In: Neue Deutsche Biographie (NDB). Band 7, Duncker & Humblot, Berlin 1966, , S. 332 f. Gussenbauer was a pioneer of modern pancreatic surgery. In 1882 he performed the first successful operation of a pancreatic cyst via the external drainage technique that he developed. Prior to Gussenbauer's method, attempts at pancreatic surgery yielded negative results. Gussenbauer's external drainage procedure represented the first safe and effective solution for pancreatic cysts, and was widely used until the 1950s. Following Billroth's first successful laryngectomy on 31 December 1873, Gussenbauer created an external vocal prosthesis (artificial larynx) for the patient. It was a mechanism with a vibrating reed that was inserted into a fistula from a tracheostomy tube to the pharynx. It was reported that the patient spoke with an intelligible voice.

To map the route of the expedition, the Canadian government sent along two geographers, Frank Swannell and Ernest Lemarque. The expedition started off at Edmonton, Alberta on July 6, 1934 and their goal was to travel to Telegraph Creek, British Columbia. Much of the trip would have to be made through regions that were relatively uncharted and had no trails. The route The Albertan leg of their journey began at Edmonton, moved to Athabasca, Grande Prairie and then into British Columbia to Dawson Creek, and Fort St. John. From there the expedition headed north to Montney and then northwest to Halfway River on to Whitewater Post over the Northern Rocky Mountains. From there, Bedaux had planned for the expedition to cross over the Sifton Pass, to Dease Lake and the Stikine River to Telegraph Creek, and ultimately the Pacific Ocean. However, this final leg of the trip was never completed.Bob Dyke Training camp in Jasper In June 1934, Bedaux assembled the members of the expedition in Jasper, Alberta, for compulsory fitness training. Bedaux reported to the press that such training was necessary for what was sure to be a long and difficult trip, involving hiking, rafting and mountain climbing. However, no training sessions were accomplished as the members of the expedition were kept too busy attending champagne parties and formal dinners that were being held in their honor. The Citro√´ns Bedaux was acquainted with car manufacturer, Andre Citro√´n, who designed the Citro√´n- K√©gresse equipped half-track trucks that were used on the expedition. Of the five Citro√´ns that the party used, two slid off of cliffs and a third was used in a shot where it was put on a raft where it was supposed to meet a stick of dynamite and explode. However, the shot was ruined when the dynamite failed to explode and the truck floated down river and was stuck in a sandbar. The last two Citro√´ns were abandoned near Halfway River. When the Alaska Highway was built in the 1940s, a Fort St. John man discovered the remains of these last two half-tracks and one was donated to the Western Development Museum in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.WDM Bedaux The journey Charles Bedaux overseeing the film crew After enjoying a champagne breakfast hosted by Edmonton's elite and parading down Jasper Avenue, the expedition was formally sent off by Alberta's Lieutenant Governor. Just outside the city, it began to rain. Those dismal weather conditions would accompany the expedition through much of their trip. Despite the weather and poor road conditions, they made good progress and by July 12 they left Grande Prairie and on the 17th were in British Columbia on the trail from Taylor to Fort St, John. Cache Creek The party stayed in Fort St. John until the 22nd, purchasing supplies, repairing the Citro√´ns, hiring more cowboys and attending banquets. By then, Bedaux had come to the decision that the expedition had to become more newsworthy than it already was and he fired his radio operator and announced that the party would continue without a radio. Furthermore, he decided that the Citro√´ns were expendable and would create a bigger sensation if they were destroyed on film rather than simply making the trip intact. In August, two of the Citro√´ns were pushed over a cliff near Halfway River and a third was floated downriver for an explosion scene that didn't pan out. Nevertheless, Bedaux's plan worked and Canadian and American newspapers carried the news that three of the cars had been lost and that some of the expedition members had barely escaped death in these terrible \\"accidents\\". The party was lauded for its bravery and determination to continue on despite this terrible setback. Bedaux Expedition cowboys By mid- September, the papers were reporting that the expedition would reach its destination in October. But when the expedition arrived at Whitewater Pass, Frank Swannell, then one of the very few men who knew Northern British Columbia well enough to be considered an expert on the terrain, advised Bedaux against traveling further through the snow-covered mountain passes. His advice was proven well founded when the party's horses began to die of diseases and the route simply proved too arduous to continue. On October 17, the Edmonton Journal reported that the party was turning back. The party reached Hudson's Hope after nearly four months in the wilderness and a party was thrown in honor of their near achievement, a party which turned out to be one of the biggest celebrations that the town had ever thrown. The movie Crosby's footage disappeared only to be found decades later in a basement in Paris. A documentary, The Champagne Safari, based on this footage, was made in 1995 by filmmaker George Ungar.\\"The Saffari Champagne\\", by George Ungar (France) Places named for Bedaux * The Bedaux Pass at the head of the Muskwa River, in the Kwadacha Wilderness Provincial ParkBCGNIS Geographical Name Details Mount Bedaux.

It was first published in 1966. It was Spinrad's first published novel. Unlike Spinrad's controversial later work, this novel is a mainstream space opera featuring space battles, faster-than-light spacedrives, and an alien enemy, the Duglaari. Some 1960s themes of sexual freedom, individual fulfillment and non-conformism appear. Plot The novel takes places centuries in the future when humanity has colonized many star systems. Another race, the Duglaari or \\"Doogs\\" is slowly conquering human systems, herding the inhabitants into barren areas where they simply starve to death. The two races have approximately equal technologies, and space battles are decided by superior numbers, with the Doogs always having the advantage. The colonists are awaiting the emergence of saviors from \\"Fortress Sol\\", the Solar System, which has been closed off to all ships since the early days of the war. Before sealing themselves off with billions of space mines and robot ships, the Solarians, as they are known to the colonists, promised to re-emerge with an answer to the numeric superiority of the Duglaari. Returning from yet another lost system, a fleet commander called Palmer finds that a group of Solarians has contacted his superiors and wishes him to accompany them on a mission. The mission is to journey to the Duglaari home world and end the war. Along the way, he discovers that they are different from any people he has ever known. He was raised in a hierarchical military society, where computers make all important decisions, including the conduct of battles. He is amazed that the Solarians use computers very little, relying on their innate skills to pilot spaceships, navigate, and decide on tactics. They rely on the \\"Organic Group\\", the idea that humans have individual talents allowing them naturally to adopt roles in small cohesive groups. One man, stereotypically handsome and charismatic, is Leader. Another takes the role of Gamesmaster, intuitively understanding probability and psychology. The group includes a pair of telepaths, and a mysterious woman who has no specific role, except that the Group is better with her than without. Her role is described as \\"Glue\\". Part of her job is to relax their guest and prepare him for his role, which involves offering sexual as well as spiritual comforts. The Duglaari planets have to be approached with care, as the star-drive used to move faster than light has one deadly side effect. Used too close to a star, it will cause the star to explode. For this reason, star systems are defended by ships which tend to shoot first and ask questions later. In addition, star-ships have to be small as the FTL field cannot be more than a hundred meters in diameter, putting them at a disadvantage against defensive ships in a system. Skilfully manipulating the Duglaari psychology, the Solarians gain access to the home world and are taken to see the ruler, who seems to be no more than the mouthpiece for a huge computer system. In appearance the Duglaari are roughly humanoid except for large eyes, fur, and bat-wing ears which move to express emotion. It seems that long ago a Duglaari leader imposed his vision of a uniform, computer-controlled society on the rest of his race, with the effect of breeding Duglaari who most resemble the long-dead dictator in their psychology. Palmer is struck by how much his people have come to resemble the Duglaari because of the war, and how different the Solarians are. For the conference, the Solarians insisted that Palmer dress in a costume they supplied. This is a comic-opera military uniform festooned with gold braid, ribbons and medals. Palmer feels ridiculous, especially compared to the Solarians, who have dressed in costumes of uniform black with only a sunburst emblem on the left breast. He compares them to priests of some dark cult. To Palmer's horror, at the conference the Solarians seem to betray the colonists, boasting that Sol can never be conquered, that weapons capable of destroying the Duglaari will soon be created, but that the Solarians wish to be left alone. They offer to sacrifice the colonies as tribute. The Duglaari ruler responds that they must surrender and cease developing weapons. The Solarians arrogantly refuse. Then the Duglaari ruler announces that by gathering most of Duglaar's fleet together they can overwhelm even Sol's defences, neutralizing the threat. It only remains to liquidate the humans who have brought the matter to the attention of the Duglaari empire. The Solarians announce that unless they are allowed to leave, a nuclear device on their ship will destroy the city. The Duglaari do not believe them, since they had thoroughly scanned and searched the ship. However their instruments now show that the threat is real. In fact it is an illusion projected by the telepaths. The ship is allowed to lift off with a Duglaari escort, positioned so that if the Solarians tried to activate their star drive, they would have a 50% chance of being destroyed, and likewise if the Duglaari chose to attack, they would have a 50% chance of failing to stop the Solarians causing the sun to explode. Thus neither side has an incentive to break the truce. However Palmer spots a weakness in the scheme: once their ship reaches the point where they can safely use the FTL drive, the Duglaari can also safely launch an attack on them, and if they fail they do not risk their homeworld. Despite his disgust with the Solarians he is able to use a trick employed to disengage from fleet actions to allow them to escape. He then retreats to his cabin, hating the Solarians and all they stand for. The Solarians take Palmer to Fortress Sol, behind all its defenses, and tour the system so he can see Earth for the last time. The Duglaari fleet arrives and penetrates the defences, unleashing massive bombardments that destroy all the habitable planets. When all seems lost, a stardrive in a ship on Mercury is activated, and Sol explodes, annihilating the Doog fleet. Suddenly the Solarian scheme becomes clear to Palmer. By goading the Doogs into risking a large part of the fleet, they have destroyed so many ships that from now on, the colonists will always have the advantage. Palmer's humiliation was a necessary part of the deception. He believes that Earth sacrificed itself to save the colonies. He is wrong in one detail, however. In the final chapter, it is revealed that humanity had evacuated the Solar System and is traveling between the stars in massive Space Arks. Faster than light ships cannot be larger than a certain size, but the Arks, proceeding slower than light, can be as big as necessary. In a matter of a few decades, they will reach Alpha Centauri and humanity will reunite to defeat the Duglaari. In addition, with Earth destroyed they will cease looking back to the home world and will conquer the galaxy.

Most of the risks and terms that underwriters consider fall under the three C's of underwriting: credit, capacity and collateral. To help the underwriter assess the quality of the loan, banks and lenders create guidelines and even computer models that analyze the various aspects of the mortgage and provide recommendations regarding the risks involved. Because large securitizers such as the GSEs and other banks are large purchasers of loans from originators, and because many originators lack the balance sheets to hold onto loans for extended periods, automated underwriting guidelines are a crucial determinant of whether a mortgage will be made and at what price.  Credit reports  Credit is what the underwriter uses to review how well a borrower manages his or her current and prior debts. Usually documented by a credit report from each of the three credit bureaus, Equifax, Transunion and Experian, the credit report provides information such as credit scores, the borrower's current and past information about credit cards, loans, collections, repossession and foreclosures and public records (tax liens, judgments and bankruptcies). Typically, a borrower's credit is highly related to the probability that the loan will go into default (failure to make monthly installments). In reviewing a credit report, the credit score is considered. The credit score is an indicator of how well a borrower manages debt. Using a mathematical model, the data regarding each item on the credit report is used to produce a number between 350 and 850, known as the credit score. Higher scores represent those with less risk. When lenders refer to a representative credit score, they are referring to the median score. When multiple borrowers are involved typically the borrower with lowest median score is the one that is considered the representative credit score. Other loan programs may consider the person that earns the most money, also known as the primary wage earner, that has the representative credit score. On many loan programs there are minimum score guidelines. The most influential aspect of the credit report is quality of the credit on a person's current housing. For an example, if the borrower already has a mortgage, whether or not the borrower has paid that mortgage on time is indicative of how well they will pay in the future. This also holds true with people that rent. A lender will typically analyze the most recent 12‚Äì24 months of the borrower's housing history (also called Listing History). Delinquencies during that time period are usually unacceptable. In addition, the history of payment of loans and revolving credit is considered. A lender may require that a certain number of deposit accounts be opened for at least 24 months and have recent activity with on time payments to build a pattern of responsible use of credit. The credit report also contains the borrowers past derogatory credit. This include collections, charge offs, repossession, foreclosures, bankruptcies, liens and judgments. Typically, if any of these items are present on the report, it increases the risk of the loan. For more serious blemishes such as foreclosures and bankruptcies, a lender may require up to two to seven years from the date of satisfaction indicated by the report before approving a loan. Furthermore, the lender may require the borrower to reestablish the credit by obtaining a certain amount of new credit to rebuild their credit. It is also the prerogative of the lender to require that all collections, charge offs, liens and judgments be paid prior to closing the loan.  Income analysis  Capacity refers to the borrower's ability to make the payments on the loan. To determine this, the underwriter will analyze the borrower's employment, income, their current debt and their assets. While reviewing the borrower's employment, the underwriter must determine the stability of the income. People who are employed by a company and earn hourly wages pose the lowest risk. Self-employed borrowers pose the highest risk, since they are typically responsible for the debt and well-being of the business in addition to their personal responsibilities. Commission income also carries similar risks in the stability of income because if for any reason the borrower fails to produce business, it directly influences the amount of income produced. Usually if self-employment or commission income is used to qualify for the mortgage, a two-year history of receiving that income is required. Although a bonus (sometime it is indicated as \\"incentive pay\\" by many corporations) is part of the paystub income, a two-year employer verification is also required. Documentation of the income also varies depending on the type of income. Hourly wage earners who have the lowest risks usually need to supply paystubs and W-2 statements. However, self-employed, commissioned and those who collect rent are required to provide tax returns (Schedule C, Schedule E and K-1). Retired individuals are required to prove they are eligible for social security and document the receipt of payments, while those who receive income via cash investments must provide statements and determine the continuance of the income from those payments. In short, the underwriter must determine and document that the income and employment is stable enough to pay the mortgage in years to come. Furthermore, underwriters evaluate the capacity to pay the loan using a comparative method known as the debt-to-income ratio. This is calculated by adding the monthly liabilities and obligations (mortgage payments, monthly credit and loan payments, child support, alimony, etc.) and dividing it by the monthly income. For an example, if a borrower has a $500 car payment, $100 in credit and loan payments, pays $500 in child support and wants a mortgage with payments $1,000 per month, her total monthly obligations is $2100. If she makes $5,000 a month, her debt to income ratio is 42%. Typically the ratio must be below anywhere from 32% for the most conservative loans to 65% for the most aggressive loans. Assets are also considered when evaluating capacity. Borrowers who have an abundance of liquid assets at the time of closing statistically have lower rates of default on their mortgage. This is termed as reserves by the industry. For example, with a total mortgage payment that is $1,000 a month and the borrower has $3,000 left after paying the down payment and closing costs, the borrower has three months reserves. Underwriters also look closely at bank statements for incidences of NSF's (non-sufficient funds). If this happens regularly, this is a red flag with the underwriter because this indicates that the borrower doesn't know how to manage his or her finances. When a borrower receives a gift for the down payment the assets need to be verified. Any large deposits, in fact, showing on bank statements will require an explanation from the borrower. Furthermore, if the borrower's employment is interrupted for any reason, the borrowers would have enough cash in reserve to pay their mortgage. The amount of cash reserves is qualified by the number of payments the borrower can make on his or her total housing expenditure (the total of the principal and interest payment, taxes, insurance, homeowners insurance, mortgage insurance, and any other applicable charges) before the reserves are completely exhausted. Often lenders will require anywhere from two to twelve months of payments in reserve. If a borrower is applying for an FHA (Federal Housing Administration), there are no reserves required. The most typical asset is a borrower's checking and savings account. Other sources include retirement funds (401K, Individual Retirement Account), investments (stocks, mutual funds, CDs) and any other liquid source of funds. Funds that have penalties for withdrawing must be considered conservatively and are evaluated at 70% or less of their value. Accounts such as pensions and other accounts and personal property that lack liquidity may not be used as assets.  Collateral  Collateral refers to the type of property, value, the use of the property and everything related to these aspects. Property type can be classified as the following in the order of risk from lowest to highest: single family residence, PUD, duplex, townhouse, low rise condominium, high rise condominium, triplex and four-plexes and condotels. Occupancy is also considered part of collateral. A home can be owner occupied, used as second home or investment. Owner occupied and second homes have the least amount of default, while investment properties have higher occurrences of default. Depending upon the combination of occupancy and type of collateral, the lender will adjust the amount of risk they are willing to take. Besides occupancy and property type, value is also considered. It is important to realize price, value and cost are three different characteristics of a home. Price is the dollar amount that a seller agrees to sell a house to another party. Cost is the dollar amount needed to build the home including labor and materials. Value, which is usually the most important characteristic, is the dollar amount that is supported by recent sales of properties that have similar characteristics, in the same neighborhood and appeal to a consumer. Under fair marketing circumstances when the seller is not in distress and the housing market is not under volatile conditions, price and value should be very comparable. To determine the value, an appraisal is usually obtained. In addition to determining the value of the property, it is the appraiser‚Äôs responsibility to identify the market conditions, the appeal and amenities of the neighborhood and the condition and characteristics of the property. Value is determined by comparing recent sales of similar neighboring properties. The appraiser may make reasonable adjustments to the sales price of the other properties for lot size, square footage of the home, number of bedrooms and bathrooms and other additions such as garages, swimming pools and decks. It is the underwriter's responsibility to review the appraisal and request any further information necessary to support the value and marketability of the property. If the home needs to be foreclosed upon, the lender must be able to sell the property to recoup their losses. The comparative analysis of the collateral is known as loan to value (LTV). Loan to value is a ratio of the loan amount to the value of the property. In addition, the combined loan to value (CLTV) is the sum of all liens against the property divided by the value. For example, if the home is valued at $200,000 and the first mortgage is $100,000 with second mortgage of $50,000, the LTV is 50% while the CLTV is 75%. Naturally, the higher LTV and CLTVs increase the risk of loan. Furthermore, borrowers who contribute significant down payment (lowering the LTV) statistically have lower incidents of foreclosure. The type of the loan also may affect the LTV and is considered when evaluating the collateral. Most loans include payments towards the principal balance of the mortgage. These pose the lowest risk since the LTV is decreasing as the mortgage payments are paid. Recently, interest only mortgage have become increasingly popular. These mortgages allow the borrower to make payments that simply meet the interest due on the loan without making any contribution to the principal balance. In addition, there are loans that allow negative amortization, which means the payments do not meet the interest due on loan. Therefore, the interest that is not paid is subsequently added to the principal balance of the loan. In this case, it is possible to owe more than the value of the home during the course of the loan, which exposes the lender to the highest risk. To offset the risk of high LTV's, the lender may require what is called mortgage insurance. Mortgage insurance insures the lender against losses that may occur when a borrower defaults on his or her mortgage. Typically, this is required on loans that have LTV's that exceed 80%. The cost of the mortgage insurance is passed on to the borrower as an added expense to their monthly payment, but some banks allow what is called lender paid insurance, where the interest rate is higher in exchange for the lender paying the mortgage insurance. All government loans such an FHA and VA require mortgage insurance, regardless of the LTV.  Automated underwriting  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the two largest companies that purchase mortgages from other lenders in the United States. Many lenders will underwrite their files according to their guidelines, but to ensure the eligibility to be purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, underwriters will utilize what is called automated underwriting. This is a tool available to lenders to provide recommendations on the risk of a loan and borrower and it provides the amount of documentation needed to verify the risk. It is important to remember that the approval and feedback is subject to the underwriter's review. It is also the responsibility of the underwriter to evaluate the aspects of the loan that is beyond the scope of automated underwriting. In short, it is the underwriter that approves the loan, not the automated underwriting. On the other hand, automated underwriting has streamlined the mortgage process by providing analysis of credit and loan terms in minutes rather than days. For borrowers it reduces the amount of documentation needed and may even require no documentation of employment, income, assets or even value of the property. Automated underwriting tailors the amount of necessary documentation in proportion to the risk of the loan.  Reduced documentation  Many banks also offer reduced documentation loans which allows a borrower to qualify for a mortgage without verifying items such as income or assets. Naturally these are higher risk loans and often come with higher interest rates. Because less documentation is provided on the capacity of the borrower, there is a high emphasis on the credit and collateral. To mitigate the risk of reduced documentation loans, lenders will often not lend to higher LTVs and limit the loans to smaller loan amounts, compared to loans that are fully documented.  Approval decision  After reviewing all aspects of the loan, it is up to the underwriter to assess the risk of the loan as a whole. Each borrower and each loan is unique and many borrowers may not fit every guideline. However, certain aspects of the loan may compensate for the lack in other areas. For an example, the risk of high LTVs can be offset by the presence of a large amount of assets. Low LTVs can offset the fact that the borrower has a high debt to income ratio and excellent credit can overcome the lack of assets. In addition to compensating factors, there is a concept known as layering of risk. For an example, if the property is a high rise condo, occupied as an investment, with a high LTV and a borrower who is self-employed, the cumulative effect of all these aspects yields higher risk. Though the borrower may meet all requirements under the guidelines of the loan program, the underwriter must exercise caution. There is an old saying in lending: If your portfolio does not have one foreclosure, you are not accepting enough risk. Underwriters should review a loan from a holistic point of view; otherwise they may turn down a loan that is high risk in one aspect but low risk as a whole.

History  Journal kept by Cape Reinga Lighthouse Keeper (1945) The lighthouse was built in 1941 and first lit during May of that year. It was the last manned light to be built in New Zealand and replaced the Cape Maria Van Diemen Lighthouse, located on nearby Motuopao Island, which had been built in 1879. Accessing that lighthouse was difficult due to the rough seas in the area, so in 1938, it was decided to move the lighthouse to Cape Reinga for safety reasons. The complete lantern fittings from Motuopao Island were reused at Cape Reinga, though the new lighthouse was fitted with a 1000 watt electrical lamp instead that could be seen for 26 nautical miles (48 km). The lamp was powered by a diesel generator. In 1987, the lighthouse was fully automated and the lighthouse keepers were withdrawn. The lighthouse is now monitored remotely from Wellington. In May 2000 the original lens and lamp were replaced by a 50 watt beacon. The beacon is powered by batteries that are recharged by solar cells. The beacon flashes every 12 seconds and can be seen for 19 nautical miles (35 km).

The film's title refers to the long-held superstition of boogeymen beings, and its plot concerns two siblings who are targeted by the ghost of their mother's deceased boyfriend which has been freed from an imprisoned mirror. The film has received mixed to negative critical reviews, with criticism mainly regarding the heavy similarities from earlier horror films such as Halloween, The Exorcist, and The Amityville Horror. The film was followed by two sequels: Boogeyman II and Return of the Boogeyman. Plot Young siblings Willy and Lacey watch their mother and her boyfriend kissing in her bedroom. When their mother notices them, she has her boyfriend tie Willy to his headboard before sending Lacey to her room. Lacey frees Willy from his bed and Willy enters their room and repeatedly stabs his mother's boyfriend with a chef knife in front of a large mirror. Twenty years later, Lacey, now an adult, is married with a young son and lives with her aunt and uncle on a farm. Willy also lives with them, but has been mute since the night he killed his mother's boyfriend. One night over dinner, Lacey finds a letter in the mail from her mother, who claims to be on her deathbed and wishes to see them one last time, but Willy burns the letter. Lacey suffers from nightmares, and has a particularly frightening dream where she is dragged, tied to a bed and almost stabbed by an unseen entity. Her husband, Jake, takes her to a psychiatrist to help her confront her fears, and decides to go visit the house she grew up in. They arrive not knowing who is actually living there and meet two teenage girls and their younger brother. Their parents, the homeowners, have apparently just placed the home for sale and then gone out of town. The daughter thinks Lacey and Jake have been sent by the real estate company to view the house. Jake and Lacey pretend they want to buy the house so they can look around. At the house, Lacey sees a reflection of her mother's deceased boyfriend coming towards her in a mirror inside the bedroom where he died, and smashes the mirror in a panic with a chair. Her husband takes the broken mirror with him in an attempt to repair it, but a piece is left behind which later glows red. Shortly after, the teenage girls and their brother are all violently killed by an unseen force; the vengeful spirit of the deceased lover has been released from the mirror. Willy similarly has disturbing visions involving mirrors, which cause him to paints all the mirrors in the house black. Later, pieces of a broken mirror in a bag at his feet cause a pitchfork to levitate and nearly impale him. A shard from the broken mirror becomes stuck to Lacey's son's shoe and is left on the ground where the light refracts across a lake where a group of teenagers are partying by an abandoned house. A couple are soon impaled by a screwdriver as they're kissing in their car, while another couple drives off and leaves them. Soon after, Lacey flees to get in the house, only to see that her shirt supernaturally starts to tear apart. This also leads her to discover her aunt and uncle dead in the barn. Later, Lacey's husband brings in the family priest to investigate the mirror, only to see that when the priest's hand touches the mirror, it suddenly turns red. A piece of the mirror floats across the room and becomes lodged over Lacey's eye, letting the ghost possess her body. Controlling Lacey's body, the ghost nearly kills her husband and attacks the priest. Before he dies, the priest removes the shard from Lacey's eye, releasing her from the ghost's control, and throws it into the kitchen sink, where it bursts into flames as it touches the water. The remainder of the mirror is then thrown into a well, where the same thing happens, as an explosion releases the trapped souls and destroys the mirror once and for all. The film ends with Lacey, her brother and Kevin visiting the graveyard. After they leave, the final shard of the mirror on the ground, which had gotten stuck to her son's shoe, glows red. Cast *Suzanna Love as Lacey *Ron James as Jake *John Carradine as Dr. Warren *Nicholas Love as Willy *Raymond Boyden as Kevin Analysis Though the film has been noted as closely imitating John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), critic Jeff Franzen notes that the film possess a subtext that is filled with \\"multi-layered references to Lommel's childhood and fears, much of which lingers long after you forget about the gimmicky gore.\\" Franzen asserts that one of the film's central themes is \\"that people conspire to hide the truth, although to one or more characters the truth is obvious.\\" Production =Concept= The film also uses several apparent pieces of folklore and superstition regarding mirrors‚Äîas well as the belief that it is bad luck to break a mirror, the film also discusses the belief that breaking a mirror releases everything the mirror has ever 'seen' and that placing the pieces of a broken mirror into a bag and burying it will counteract the bad luck from breaking the mirror. Additionally, there is the belief that a mirror in a room where someone has died will show the dead person looking back over the shoulder of anyone looking into the mirror. All this was used in the Mexican translation of the film title, released as \\"El espejo asesino\\" (the killer mirror). Stylistically, Lommel stated that he wanted to make a \\"movie about outrageous killings set in an average-looking environment with ordinary actors. First establish things an audience can identify with, then inject the horror into a normal environment.\\" =Filming= Filming took place on location in the Waldorf, Maryland area, with additional photography occurring in Los Angeles, California. Release =Box office= The film was given a limited release theatrically in the United States by The Jerry Gross Organization with screenings beginning on November 14, 1980. The film grossed approximately $25 million, though little of its significant income went to the filmmakers and performers, as the Jerry Gross Company, the film's distributor, was in the midst of bankruptcy at the time of its release. =Critical response= Critical reception for Boogeyman has been mixed to negative. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 17% of 6 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.1/10. Time Out gave the film a negative review, writing, \\"Though sometimes slow, what makes the film so beguiling is its conviction and lack of condescension in depicting a world where fact and fantasy collide.\\" Garry Arnold from The Washington Post wrote in his review on the film: \\"The Boogey Man achieves a certain vicious distinction by putting the occasional spectacular kink in an otherwise motley fabric.\\" Ron Cowan of The Statesman Journal criticized the film for boasting \\"little originality in storyline or style, relying instead on the sheer energy and determination it brings to bloodletting.\\" Bruce Bailey of the Montreal Gazette wrote: \\"This film is so sick, it ought to be hospitalizedpermanently. The Boogey Man mixes a bit of sex with standard shock devices, primordial fears and Freudian jealousies. It blends them into something which is tawdry, rather than a good old-fashioned spine-tingler.\\" Film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film a favorable 3 out of 4 stars, writing, \\"German art film actor-director Lommel lends unconventional angle to this combination of The Exorcist and Halloween. Effects are quite colorful, if somewhat hokey.\\" =Home media= The film was released on VHS by Wizard Video. The film has been released on DVD twice in the United States. The first release was in 1999 by Anchor Bay Entertainment alongside Lommel's The Devonsville Terror (1983). This version is currently out of print. It was subsequently re-released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in 2005 alongside Lommel's Return of the Boogeyman (1994). The Boogeyman was placed on the UK's DPP list in 1984, but was later re-released on the Vipco label in 1992 in a cut form. In 2000 it was released uncut. Sequels Boogeyman II was filmed in 1981, but unreleased until 1983. Directed by Bruce Starr and an uncredited Ulli Lommel, it was written by Starr, Lommel and the original film's star, Suzanna Love, although the writing goes uncredited in the film. In Boogeyman 2, Lacey is approached by a group of Hollywood phonies to make a movie based on her experiences. Lacey travels to Hollywood, to the home of a film director (played by Ulli Lommel himself), where she brings along the last surviving haunted mirror shard from the end of the first movie as proof to her horrifying experiences. One by one, the phonies are killed by the mirror spirit who possesses the body of the director's manservant. Boogeyman 2 is padded with many flashback sequences from the first film. Return of the Boogeyman (or Boogeyman 3) was released on May 5, 1994, and is largely constructed around numerous flashbacks to The Boogeyman as well. In 2016 Hollywood Action House began developing Boogeyman Chronicles, a series of eight 45-min. episodes. The first episode is currently in post-production and the series will start airing on Halloween 2018 worldwide. It is inspired by Ulli Lommel's 1980 cult hit The Boogeyman. The new storyline was developed after test audiences in the US and Europe saw various cuts of a series of plot-possibilities and characters entitled Boogeyman: Reincarnation. The writing team headed by Colin McCracken is currently working on episodes 2 - 8 with the plan to create a total of up to 64 episodes. Lommel has indicated that, even though he directed episode 1, most of the remaining episodes will be directed by a series of young directors from the US, Europe and Asia. Starring in episode 1 are Skylar Radzion, Laurence R. Harvey, Andreea Boyer and Tristan Risk. It was produced by Frank Dragun, Ulli Lommel and David Bond. It is set to develop the story of his famous cult-hit The Boogeyman.

Wilhelmine is mainly known for her relationship with Klemens Metternich, a statesman of the Austrian Empire. French transcription of her name is Wilhelmine Catherine Fr√©d√©rique Biron, Czech Kate≈ôina Frederika Vilhelm√≠na princezna Kuronsk√°. Among the Czechs she is known as knƒõ≈æna Kate≈ôina Zah√°≈àsk√° (Zah√°≈à is Czech name for ≈ªaga≈Ñ). Early life Wilhelmine was born to Peter von Biron, the last Duke of Courland, and his third wife Anna Charlotte Dorothea von Medem (1761‚Äì1821). She had three conjugal sisters: Maria Luise Pauline (1782‚Äì1845), Johanna Katharina (1783‚Äì1876), wife of F√ºrst Don Francesco, Duke of Acerenza (brother of the 8th Prince of Belmonte), and Dorothea (1793‚Äì1862), later wife of Edmond de Talleyrand-P√©rigord (1787‚Äì1872), nephew of the French statesman Talleyrand. Wilhelmine spent her earliest childhood in Mitau. In 1795 the Duke was forced to cede his Duchy to the Russian Empire, and the family moved to the Duchy of Sagan (≈ªaga≈Ñ) in Silesia, which had been acquired in 1786. Among other properties bought by her father during the 1780s was County N√°chod in Bohemia, which included Ratibo≈ôice Castle. Wilhelmine, who inherited both Sagan and N√°chod, selected this castle as her summer residence. The young duchess was very beautiful, intelligent, eloquent and educated in philosophy and history. She fell in love with Finnish general Gustav Armfelt, her mother's lover and her tutor. The secret relationship with a much older and married Armfelt resulted in the birth of an illegitimate daughter named Adelaide Gustava Aspasia (nicknamed Vava), who was born in secrecy in Hamburg on 13 January 1801. The delivery was traumatic, and, due to an incompetent midwife, she lost the ability to have further children. Wilhelmine gave up her child to one of Armfelt's relatives in Finland and never saw her again.Vava later married with a relative, Magnus Reinhold Armfelt, on 12 November 1825, with whom she had five children: August Magnus Gustav, Mauritz Vilhelm Romuald, Gustav Johan Philip, Hedvig Johanna Vilhelmina Gustava (by marriage Wrede af Elim√§) and Carl Magnus Mauritz. After the death of her husband on 29 April 1845, Vava married secondly on 21 May 1846 with Johan August von Essen, with whom she had no children. Vava died on 19 May 1881 at √Öbo, Sweden, aged 80. Source: Adelaide Gustava Aspasia Armfelt in: armigerousdescents.com [retrieved 20 June 2015]. Wilhelmine greatly regretted this decision as time went on. To protect her reputation, Armfelt organized a marriage for her with an √©migr√© French nobleman, (1768‚Äì1836), the son of the Princesse de Gu√©m√©n√©, the original governess of the children of King Louis XVI of France. The marriage did not last and ended in divorce in 1805. Wilhelmine spent the rest of her life moving between Vienna, Prague, Ratibo≈ôice and Sagan (≈ªaga≈Ñ). She also undertook journeys to Italy, England and France. Her second marriage with prince Vasily Troubetzkoy (1776‚Äì1841), which lasted from 1805 to 1806, also ended in divorce. In Vienna, she set up a salon attended by the highest nobility. An attractive woman, she attracted many aristocratic lovers. She had a short-lived and turbulent relationship during the spring of 1810 with Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr√§tz, an Austrian army commander. Metternich Although Wilhelmine first met Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich (1773‚Äì1859) in 1801, their love affair did not start until the spring of 1813. The passion between the two is documented by over 600 letters written by Metternich that were discovered in 1949 by Marie Ulrichov√° in Plasy Cloister. These letters also describe the minute details of the political situation of the day and the corresponding decisions made by Metternich as a diplomat and government official. Modern historians speculate that Wilhelmine, who hated Napoleon, was the one who pushed Metternich away from a cautious pro-French position. The negotiations in 1813 that resulted in an anti-Napoleonic coalition between Prussia, Austria and Russia were held in one of Wilhelmine's homes, Ratibo≈ôice Castle. During the Congress of Vienna (1814‚Äì15), the relationship ended, as Wilhelmine didn't like playing the role of an unacknowledged mistress, a role forced onto her as Metternich was married, and also because Alfred Windischgraetz (alternative spelling) appeared in Vienna, and she could not resist resuming her affair with him, writing \\"with friends one counts the days, with you I count the nights, and I would not wish to miss a single one of them\\"Rites of Peace - the fall of Napoleon and the Congress of Vienna, Adam Zamoyski, HarperCollins 2007, p.319. This distracted Metternich at a critical stage in the negotiations. Because of the impossibility of having any more children, she became a foster parent to many young girls. From 1819 until 1828, Wihelmine was married to Prince Karl Rudolf von der Schulenburg (1788‚Äì1856). This marriage also ended in divorce. What she feared the most - being alone - eventually became reality toward the end of her life. Relation with Bo≈æena Nƒõmcov√° Famous Czech author Bo≈æena Nƒõmcov√° (1820?‚Äì1862) was one of the poor family girls supported by Wilhelmine. Nƒõmcov√° portrayed Wilhelmine in her 1855 novel Babiƒçka (The Grandmother) as an ideal woman. The portrait is so touching that Czech collocation \\"pan√≠ knƒõ≈æna\\" (meaning \\"the princess\\") became a synonym for Wilhelmine. All four Courland sisters are known to have had illegitimate children, Johanna at age sixteen. Because of her unknown origin (even the date of her birth is disputed) and the favour shown her by the duchess, several historians believe that Nƒõmcov√° could have been an illegitimate daughter of Wilhelmine and either Metternich, Count Karel Clam- Martinic or Windischgr√§tz. Helena Sobkov√°, a writer of popular-history books about Nƒõmcov√°, believes that Nƒõmcov√° may actually have been the niece of Wilhelmine. In 1816 an illegitimate daughter was born to Wilhelmine's younger sister, Dorothea, and Karel Clam-Martinic (1792‚Äì1840). The child's fate is unknown, and it is possible that Wilhelmine gave the child to Nƒõmcov√°'s parents to raise as their own. This suggestion, however, has not been definitely proven.

December 10, 2013 The film is based on the book What Just Happened? Bitter Hollywood Tales from the Front Line by Art Linson, about his experiences as a producer in Hollywood.\\"What Just Happened?: Bitter Hollywood Tales from the Front Line\\".Author Art Linson This film was shown at the Cannes Film Festival on May 25, 2008.2008 Cannes Film Festival Lineup. voices.yahoo.com. December 10, 2013 Plot Ben (Robert De Niro), a veteran Hollywood producer, is suffering a number of professional and personal problems. His latest film, Fiercely, has a disastrous test screening, mostly because of its ending which features the murder of its main character (played by Sean Penn, who plays himself elsewhere in the film) along with his pet dog. Ben and his maverick British director, Jeremy Brunell (Michael Wincott), plead their case to studio executive Lou Tarnow (Catherine Keener). She accuses Ben of filming the dog's killing only so he could use it as a \\"bargaining chip\\" - to make it easier to negotiate against cutting other problematic scenes. Lou threatens to pull Ben's movie from Cannes and take over editing unless at least the dog's death is removed. Jeremy adamantly refuses, throwing a tantrum. Adding to Ben's problems, he is having trouble making a clean break from Kelly, his second wife. Ben later discovers his wife is having an affair with Scott Solomon, a married screenwriter who Ben has previously worked with. Scott has a screenplay that he's trying to get off the ground, to which Brad Pitt later becomes attached. Lastly the studio is threatening to cancel a planned Bruce Willis movie because of the star's unwillingness to shave the large, thick beard that he has grown. Ben's career hinges on the fate of the film, but any attempt to reason with Willis inevitably meets a violent, foul-mouthed response. Ultimately Jeremy relents and re-edits the ending of Fiercely to have the dog survive. Ben tries to get Willis's agent, Dick Bell, to reason with him and get the beard removed, but his efforts only get Ben fired. Nonetheless, Willis does eventually shave his beard off, and the film goes ahead. A week later, Ben, Lou and Jeremy attend Cannes, hopeful that they might take a Palme D'Or award. Unfortunately, and without telling Ben or Lou, Jeremy has re-edited Fiercely again, not only killing the dog, but adding nearly a full minute of bullets being shot into their bodies. While the new ending destroys the film's chances of a Palme d'Or and angers many in the audience, others eagerly applaud the final version of the film, including Sean Penn (playing himself). Lou is not impressed, and immediately flies out of Cannes on the studio's private jet, leaving Ben stranded in France. Ben eventually does make it back home, in time for a photo-shoot of Hollywood's top thirty producers with Vanity Fair, although after the magazine's publishers hear about the debacle in Cannes, Ben is relegated to the far edge of the photo, meaning he will be barely noticeable.

Thomas Dermer explored the eastern coastline of America from 1614 to 1620. He was associated with Captain John Smith, The Newfoundland Company, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Jamestown, The Plymouth Company, and The Merchant Adventurers. Dermer, working side by side with Squanto, is credited with starting to normalize the relations between the Native Americans and Europeans. He was known to the Pilgrims from copies of his letters, that they had obtained. The Pilgrim colony directly benefited from the diplomatic ground work of Dermer and Squanto.  1614 to 1618: Explorations  Born in Plymouth, England, Dermer first went to New England with Captain John Smith, who was sent out in 1614 by London merchants to lay the foundations of a new plantation and to trade with the Native Americans there. Dermer was to accompany Smith on his 1615 voyage to New England but the ship, after encountering pirates and the French, finally made its way back to Plymouth with great difficulty.Hunt, E., \\"Dermer, Thomas\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 1, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003‚Äì. Dermer then spent some time in Newfoundland, 1616‚Äì18, with his associate, Governor John Mason, at Cuper's Cove (now Cupids), where he was possibly engaged in the fishing business but more likely involved in explorations of the island's natural resources. He wrote a letter, dated September 9, 1616, from Cuper's Cove, in which he describes in favorable terms the fertility of the soil, abundance of wildlife, and mineral potentialities, an evidence of his interest in the commercial possibilities of the area.  Dermer meets Tisqantum (Squanto)  Historical Native American Tribal Territories of Southern New England It was during this stay in Newfoundland that Dermer met Tisquantum (better known as Squanto), the Patuxet Native American, who, with 24 others from Patuxet and Nauset, had been seized by Capt. Thomas Hunt in 1614 to be sold into slavery in M√°laga Spain. Tisquantum and others were redeemed by local friars in Spain and sent to England. He eventually came into the care of John Slany, a London merchant, treasurer of the Newfoundland Company, and shipbuilder. Tisquantum learned English and in 1616 was sent by Slany to Cuper's Cove as an interpreter. Dermer saw the value in Tisquantum's ability to speak English and to become an interpreter between the New England colonizers and the Indians. Accompanied by Tisquantum, Dermer returned to England in 1618 to confer with Sir Ferdinando Gorges who was a leader of the Plymouth Company merchants attempting to colonize New England. Gorges, who favored co-operation with the Indians as a matter of policy, agreed with Dermer's plan. Gorges commissioned Dermer as commander of his 1619 expedition to New England with Tisquantum as interpreter and expert on North American natural resources.  Dermer's Letter of December 27, 1619  Captain Dermer's small fleet arrived at the Monhegan (Maine) fishing grounds in May 1619. After \\"leaving the fishermen to their labour at Monhegan\\", Dermer, a small crew, and Tisquantum, left on an open pinnace of five tons to locate Patuxet. They arrived at Patuxet in June 1619. The journey from Monhegan revealed that there had been a terrible depopulation of the Natives in the last three years. Dermer writes \\"...found some ancient Plantations, not long since populous, now utterly void\\". Patuxet, as well as all the villages up and down the coast, were deserted; most of the inhabitants dead from some sort of great epidemic. Thomas Morton, would say \\"and the bones and skulls upon several places of their habitations made such a spectacle after my coming into these parts, that, as I traveled in the Forest near the Massachusetts, it seemed to me a new found Golgotha\\".Morton, Thomas. The Essential New English Canaan, 1637, Jack Dempsey Edition, 1999 After their initial survey of the abandoned Patuxet village, the English and Tisquantum, proceeded inland to find survivors and to learn more of what had happened. After a days journey westward they arrived at the inhabited village of Namasket (Middleborough, MA). The outrage of Hunt's actions of 1614 caused hatred and distrusted between the Europeans and the Indians, to the point that when in 1617 a French fishing ship was shipwrecked on the shores of Cape Cod a few men escaped death only by being enslaved by the Nausets; all the others were killed. Dermer wrote: \\"...for which cause (the previous kidnappings and acts of violence of the Europeans) Squanto cannot deny but they would have killed me when I was at Namasket, had not he (Squanto) entreated hard for me...\\" Afterwards Dermer sent a messenger \\"...a day's journey farther west to Poconaokit (Bristol,Rhode Island), which bordereth on the sea, whence came to see me two kings, attended with a guard of fifty men, who being well satisfied with what my savage (Tisquantum) and I discoursed unto them, (being desirous of novelty,) gave me content in whatsoever I demanded, where I found that former relations were true\\". The 'kings' were Massasoit and his brother Quadequina. Dermer then writes: \\"...Here I redeemed a Frenchman, and afterwards another at Mastachusit, who three years since escaped shipwreck at the north-east of Cape Cod...\\".Philbrick, Nathaniel. Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War, Penguin, 2006, , p. 374 Dermer returned with his men and Tisquantum to the boat at Patuxet, where they explored a few more days what are now the islands of Boston Harbor, prospecting for gold. By mid-June 1619, Dermer and his crew returned to Monhegan; Tisquantum was dropped off at Sawahquatooke (now Saco, Maine) 'to stay with some of our (Indian) friends'. Dermer supervised the dispatching of the fishing vessels to England. He put most of his provisions on board Captain Ward's ship, The Sampson, which was bound for Virginia. Dermer and a few others then explored the Eastern coastline of America in a small open pinnacle, from Monhegan to Virginia. During the voyage south, the boat and crew endure storms and leaks. At one desperate moment they throw most of their provisions overboard to regain control of the ship, before it is dashed upon some stormy rocks. He writes that his relations within the Indians are now strained without Tisquantun to intercede. On the southern tip of Cape Cod, Dermer is captured by the still seething Nausets. The Indians try to kill his men on the pinnace. But then, in a bold move (Dermer described it as 'after a strange manner'), Dermer escapes with a Nauset leader and two others as prisoners. Dermer then ransoms them back to the Nausets for hatchets and a canoe full of corn and hastily departs. Artist's depiction of the attack on Capt. Nicholas Hobson's ship by Wampanoag warriors in 1614 on Martha's Vineyard, allowing Epenow to escape. Dermer's expedition then headed to Capaock, or Martha's Vineyard, (named by Bartholomew Gosnold in 1602) to discover the truth behind the conflicting stories of what happened to Epenow, a sachem taken from Capaock in 1611 by a Capt Harlow and brought to England. After paraded around London as a wonder, he became an interpreter, and claimed to know where gold might be found in New England, a gambit that would provide a chance for him to return home. Captain Nicholas Hobson brought him back to Capaock in 1614. In a tense standoff in a harbor against many canoes, Epenow called out to his kinsmen in their language and sets the stage. A hail of arrows erupted from the canoes and Epenow dove off the rails of Hobson's ship. Once back in England, an empty-handed Hobson related that Epenow was killed in the skirmish. Dermer arrived at Capaock in the summer of 1619 and met a very alive Epenow. Dermer writes \\"...(he) was reported to have been slain with divers of his countrymen by sailors, which was false. With him I had much conference, who gave me very good satisfaction in every thing almost I could demand.\\" Dermer mused that he didn't have time to prospect for gold and left on good terms to continue his voyage \\"...searching every harbour, and compassing every cape-land till he arrived in Virginia.\\" He sailed Long Island Sound, previously explored by Adriaen Block, and loses an anchor at the rocky tidal channel at Hell Gate. He reached Virginia in September and wintered over at Martyn's Plantation where he writes in December 1619 that he almost died a month before from sickness.Purchas, Samuel. \\"Letter of Thomas Dermer : describing his passage from Maine to Virginia, A.D. 1619\\", Purchas's Pilgrims, London: 1625.  Dermer's Letter of June 30, 1620  A fully recovered Dermer left Jamestown in May 1620 heading to New England to \\"accomplish what his last discovery had omitted\\". He met with the Dutch at Manhattan and warned them that they were trespassers on English claims, afterwards he went on to New England. Extracts from this letter, which appears in New England's Memorial, makes a prescient statement, \\"...I will first begin with that place whence Squanto, or Tisquantum was taken away, which in Captain's Smith's map is called Plimouth...I would that the first plantation might here be seated, if there come to the number of fifty persons or upwards...\\" Five months later, in November 1620, the Mayflower will arrive at the tip of Cape Cod, and then six weeks later, deliver 102 Pilgrims, who also possess of a copy of Captain Smith's map, to this very place where they will found the colony of Plimoth Plantation, at the abandoned village of Patuxet.Extracts of Dermer's June 30, 1620 appear in New England's Memorial, Nathaniel Morton 1669; Morton had access to William Bradford's original manuscript and Bradford's complete letterbook. See: Of Plimoth Plantation for the story of the loss and recovery of the complete manuscript and partial letterbook.  1620: Death  Nathaniel Morton, states that after Dermer wrote the June 1620 relation (letter), \\"...he came to the island of Capaock, which lieth south from this place, in the way to Virginia, and the aforesaid Squanto with him; where he going ashore amongst the Indians to trade as he used to do, was assaulted and betrayed by them, and all his men slain, but one that kept the boat; but got on board very sore wounded, and they had cut off his head upon the cuddy of the boat, had not his man rescued him with a sword...\\" According to Jeremy Belknap, Epenow believed that Dermer had come to take him back to England.Belknap, Jeremy. \\"Gorges\\", American Biography, Isaiah Thomas and Ebenezer T. Andrews. Faust's Statue, No. 45, Newbury Street, 1794, p. 362 John Smith reported that Dermer escaped with multiples wounds (up to fourteen) and immediately returns to Virginia where he dies of complications of those wounds. In the 1650s Gorges would write that Dermer \\"..had the misfortune to fall sick and die of the infirmity many of our nation are subject unto at their first coming into those parts.\\" Morton in New England's Memorial goes on to state that after the attack at Capoack, \\"...and so they (Dermer and one other) got away, and made shift to get to Virginia, where he died, whether of his wounds, or the diseases of the country, or both, is uncertain.\\"  Legacy  Captain Dermer, with the help of Tisquantum, began the process of normalizing relations with the New England Indians after years of kidnappings by Europeans (1525: Estev√£o Gomes, 1600s: Captains George Weymouth, Edward Harlow, Thomas Hunt, and others). The Nausets were hostile, but the Wampanoag Confederacy would take a more measured approach with the Europeans after Dermer's work and the social and political upheavals from the devastating epidemics of 1616 to 1618. The result of Dermer's 1619 mission was quite satisfactory to his employers, who in their published manifesto gave him the credit of \\".. making peace between the Indians of those parts and the English... of which the colony of New Plymouth afterwards reaped the benefits.\\"  Fictional Reference  British actor Nathaniel Parker portrayed Captain Thomas Dermer in the 1994 movie Squanto: A Warrior's Tale.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, Toronto Blue Jays, Tampa Bay Rays, Washington Nationals, and Los Angeles Angels. While he primarily played shortstop during his career, Escobar later transitioned to third base. Early life Escobar was born in Havana, Cuba. Brayan Pe√±a, a former teammate of Escobar with the Atlanta Braves, was Escobar's best friend growing up in Cuba, with the two boys often playing on the same team and sharing bats, gloves, and cleats. In 2004, Escobar defected from Cuba by sea, and landed in the Florida Keys.Yunel Escobar ‚Äì Mop-Up Duty Career =Atlanta Braves= The Braves drafted Escobar in the second round of the 2005 draft, 75th overall. \\"We saw him as a premium talent\\", said Roy Clark, Atlanta's scouting director. \\"A lot of clubs didn't feel that they had enough background [on him].\\" Former Braves general manager John Schuerholz said he does not hesitate when he finds a Cuban who fits his team's needs. \\"I'm not a politician\\", Schuerholz said. \\"I'm a baseball general manager. We look for baseball talent wherever we can find it. And wherever it is, we go after it.\\" Escobar's tense relationship with Cuban authorities in the aftermath of Pe√±a's defection had limited his exposure to major league scouts. With little more than a few off-season workouts to draw upon, most teams were reluctant to take a chance on Escobar. The Braves, however, spoke with Pe√±a, who had been called up to the majors to play for the Braves only days before Escobar was drafted in the 2005 draft. Braves officials asked Pe√±a countless questions about everything from Escobar's skill set to his command of English to his family background. \\"The best recommendation we got was from Brayan\\", Clark says. Escobar received a $475,000 signing bonus. After being drafted and signed by the Braves in 2005, Yunel began in the Appalachian League with Danville, hitting .400 with two homers. Escobar played the entire 2006 season in Double-A Mississippi and was selected to All-Star Futures Game. His performance in Mississippi was somewhat disappointing with a few bright spots. Escobar showed good plate discipline with 59 walks against just 77 strikeouts. This led to a strong .361 on-base percentage. However, Escobar saw his power numbers drop. His slugging percentage fell to .346 (it was .470 in 2005) and his OPS went from .828 to .707. Throughout these struggles, Escobar developed a contentious relationship with manager, Jeff Blauser. His talent reasserted itself with a strong performance in the Arizona Fall League.Baby Braves  MVN - Most Valuable Network ¬ª Blog Archive ¬ª Prospect Profile: Yunel Escobar Escobar had a very strong spring training for the Braves in 2007 before being sent down to Triple-A Richmond to start the season. Escobar set the Triple-A International League on fire during his short stint there during the first two months of the 2007 season. In 46 games, Escobar hit .333 with a .379 OBP and a .456 SLG. Escobar made his major league debut on June 2, 2007 against the Chicago Cubs at third base. He hit a single in his first Major League at-bat, and finished the game 2-for-4 with a double, an RBI, and a run. His double in the top of the 8th inning gave the Braves the lead in their 5‚Äì3 win. \\"This is what I dreamed about when I first left Cuba and got to the United States\\", said Escobar, with Braves bench coach Chino Cadahia serving as an interpreter. \\"It was especially great because it was in a city like Chicago and there were so many people here. Having the game-winning RBI, playing good defense and having the team win, I couldn't have dreamed it any better.\\" \\"I had plenty of confidence in myself that I could get the job done\\", said Escobar. \\"It's fun to see any young kid come up\\", Braves manager Bobby Cox said. \\"[Escobar] battles. He's a no-fear type of player and hitter.\\" \\"I've always had a lot of confidence in myself\\", Escobar said. \\"It's just the game of baseball.\\" Escobar's first Major League home run came on June 4, 2007 against Florida Marlins pitcher Wes Obermueller. In the fourth inning of a 2‚Äì2 game ‚Äì his first at Turner Field ‚Äì Escobar took a high fastball from Obermueller the \\"opposite way\\", hitting it over the wall in right field. He finished the day 4-for-4 with two singles and a double in addition to his home run. On July 27, 2007, in a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Escobar exhibited an uncanny sense of alertness (and riskiness) as the Braves were down 7‚Äì6 in the bottom of the ninth inning. With two outs, Escobar drew a walk from Arizona closer Jos√© Valverde. Seeing Valverde bending down to fix his sock with his back turned toward second base with no position player near the bag, Escobar sprinted immediately for second base. By the time Valverde realized what Escobar was attempting to do, it was too late to throw him out. He scored from second on the next play as Willie Harris hit a two-out single, tying the game at 7‚Äì7 and completing a seven-run comeback for Atlanta. The Braves, however, went on to lose in extra innings. \\"You'd be shocked how many times players could do that, that don't\\", said Cox, who says he was successful with this daring attempt during his Major League days with the Yankees. \\"It's something you see a lot in the Minors and not as much up here, because guys have had it happen to them in the Minors\\", Renter√≠a said. \\"That's why when a guy gets to first base, I'm always paying attention.\\" On August 5, 2007, Escobar recorded his first career walk-off hit against the Colorado Rockies in the 10th inning when he singled in Jeff Francoeur to give the Braves a 6‚Äì5 win. On August 29, Escobar belted his first leadoff homer in a 7‚Äì4 win over the Marlins. Escobar finished his rookie season with a .326 batting average.

It's a demanding 5-event physical challenge that firefighters throughout the world participate in and try to complete with the fastest time. Competition events include a stair climb with a high-rise pack, hose hoist, forcible entry, hose advance, and a victim rescue. The primary purpose for the Firefighter Combat Challenge is to promote physical fitness, an essential part of structural firefighting.. Stefano, Mike. Physical Preparations for the Firefighter Combat Challenge . Retrieved on 29 Oct 2009. . History In 1975, The Sports Medicine Center of the University of Maryland received a federal grant in the amount of $87K from the precursor to the US Fire Administration (The National Fire Prevention and Control Administration-then a part of the Department of Commerce). Instrumental in facilitating the grant was Chief Dave Gratz the Director of Fire-Rescue Services of Montgomery County (MD) and Dr. Leonard Marks (a candidate for the director of what would ultimately become the USFA). The research scientists who were the principal investigators of a study to measure and characterize the physical demands of structural fire fighting were Dr. Charles O. Dotson, Dr. D. Laine Santa Maria, Dr. Paul O. Davis and Dr. Richard A. Schwartz. Their research was published in a GPO Technical Report and later authored by Drs. Davis, Dotson and Santa Maria in a peer-reviewed publication of the American College of Sports Medicine (Davis, Paul O., Charles O. Dotson and D. Laine Santa Maria. \\"Relationship Between Simulated Firefighting Tasks and Physical Performance Measures.\\" Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, Vol. 14, No. 1, pp. 65‚Äì71, 1982.) While not intended as a sports competition, a large part of the research was based upon five sequentially performed fire ground evolutions garnered upon input from a Job Task Analysis (JTA) conducted with the assistance of the Greater Washington Council of Governments Fire Training Officers sub-committee. One-hundred randomly selected firefighters from five political jurisdictions participated in both laboratory-based physical performance measures and the Criterion Task Test (CTT). The results of the study graphically, and not surprisingly demonstrated an ascending level of performance with higher levels of muscular strength, lean body mass and PWC (physical work capacity). Originally intended as an entry-level, or personnel selection instrument, not until 1991 would the Firefighter Combat Challenge appear as a major industry sports event, when again, at the University of Maryland's MFRI (Maryland Fire Rescue Institute) would the first competition be held, organized by Dr. Paul Davis and the staff of On Target Productions. The first challenge was won by Prince William County, VA in 1991, the only challenge held that year. In 1992, seven regional challenges were held, with the first World Challenge held coincidental with the IAFC convention in Anaheim, CA. DuPont was the Title Sponsor for the first two years. In 1994, Scott Health and Safety came on board and assumed Title Sponsor in 1999. Television has been an important part of the Challenge. FETN covered the 1992 Championship followed by ESPN for 10 years. Recently, the Versus (VS) network, owned by Comcast has carried the World Challenge Championships. Through an assortment of media outlets, upwards of 40 million people per year can be identified as gross market impressions. The rules, procedures and trademarks of this competition (Intellectual Property, i.e., IP) are protected through a copyright issued by the US Patent Office in 1993.

Competitors must wear a helmet, coat, pants with liners, boots, gloves, and a breathing apparatusan SCBAduring the entire duration of competition. The Challenge is timed from the start of the first event to the end of the fifth event. Competitors must complete the five events within six minutes. Completion times below three minutes are considered excellent. Times below five minutes are acceptable. Since this Challenge is extremely physical, the course director may end a competitor's run if they see the competitor is risking their own health. =Stair Climb with High Rise Pack= The first event is the stair climb. This Challenge consists of a 42 lb. hose which must be carried up six flights of stairs. This activity replicates a five-story building where water is needed at the top. The 42 lb. hose is a standard 100 ft., 1.75 in. thick. hose. The stairwell consists of six sets of stairs, each with ten steps. The firefighter must carry the hose up the stairs and place it in a container box on the top story of the stairwell. The hose may not touch the ground at any point before the firefighter places it in the container box., About The Firefighter Challenge. Retrieved on 29 Oct 2009. . . Once the 42 lb. hose is in the box, the firefighter may proceed with the second event, then descend the stairs, touching each tread and holding on to both handrails on each side of the stairway. On reaching the floor, the firefighter goes onto the next event. Their time is continued and any penalties are added to the final time. Penalties include not touching every step or holding onto the hand rails, which results in a 2-second time addition to their final time per occurrence. The firefighter may also be disqualified if at any time the hose comes off or slides out of the container at the top of the stairway. =Hose Hoist= Hose Hoist-Competitor raising a 42 lb. donut roll up the 5 story FCC Tower The second event is the Hose Hoist. Using a hand-over-hand motion, the competitor must pull up a 42-pound (19 kg) hose roll and place it into the box on the top of the 5-story Tower. The 42 lb. prop is a donut roll of large diameter hose (LDH [plus 7 pounds [7.2 kg] of rope). Time continues from the previous event. Loss of control (i.e., allowing the donut to fall more than one story), will result in disqualification. =Forcible Entry= Forcible Entry-Competitor hitting 160 lb. beam with 9 lb. sledgehammer The third event is the forcible entry challenge. This event simulates a firefighter breaking down a door or wall to enter a burning building. The forcible entry simulator used during the Firefighter Combat Challenge is called the KEISER FORCE Machine. In this evolution, the firefighter stands over a 160 lb. beam. They must slam a nine and a half-pound shot mallet into the beam until the beam moves five feet. The firefighter must keep both hands below a tape-marked line on the mallet, and only contact the beam with the head of the mallet. This tape marked line is 1 ft. down from the head of the mallet. The upper edge of the beam is covered with a pressure-sensitive tape that makes contacts other than by the head of the mallet visible. The firefighter receives a warning for the first handle strike. Any hit by the handle afterwards adds five seconds to the final time. Pushing, and raking of the beam is not allowed and is grounds for disqualification. At the first hit, time continues from the previous event. The event is complete once the competitor places the mallet on a 4‚Äô x 3‚Äô mat at the end of the 5 ft. distance. Any part of the mallet must be placed on the mat before the firefighter goes to the next event. =Hose Advance= Hose Advance- Competitor releasing the nozzle to spray target once through the swinging doors The fourth event is the hose advance. This simulates a firefighter running from a fire engine towards a close fire. The competitor sprints 140 feet and picks up a 1.75 in. diameter charged (pressurized with water) hose, sprints five more feet with the hose, then drags it an additional 75 feet. Once at the 75 ft line and through the swinging doors, the competitor must then open the hose nozzle, releasing water onto a small target. After hitting the target, they must close the nozzle and drop the hose, which completes the event. The hose nozzle may only be opened once the nozzle opens the swinging doors, if the nozzle is opened earlier a 2-second penalty is added to the final time. If the competitor does not close the nozzle, they must come back close the nozzle and then resume the final event. =Victim Rescue= Victim Rescue- Competitor dragging mannequin from behind down the 100ft runway The fifth and final event is the victim rescue. This event simulates a firefighter removing a victim from a fire as quickly as possible to save the victim from injury. A 175 lb. mannequin must be picked up from the ground, grabbed from behind, and dragged backwards 100 ft. The competitor must drag it backwards at all points of time. The competitor must grab the mannequin from behind with their arms beneath the mannequins arms and around the mannequin's chest. Time ends once the 175 pound mannequin and the competitor passes the 100 ft line. Then competition has ended the Challenge course, and time is stopped. References Davis, Paul O., Charles O.

The school has five different locations for different age groups. The Nursery School, located in Hampstead on Fitzjohn's Avenue, is for 2 years 9 months - 5 year olds. The Pre-Preparatory School is just around the corner on Netherhall Gardens and is for 5 - 7 year olds, and the Preparatory School is situated on Gloucester Avenue near Regent's Park and is for 7 - 13 year olds. North Bridge House has two Senior School campuses, one in Hampstead for 11- to 16-year-olds and one in Canonbury, Islington for 13 - 18 year olds. The current headmistress of the Nursery and Pre-Prep Schools is Mrs Christine McLelland. The current headmaster of the Prep School is Mr Brodie Bibby. The headmaster of the Senior School in Hampstead is Mr Brendan Pavey. The headmaster of the Senior School and Sixth Form in Canonbury is also Mr Brendan Pavey . With acting head Mr Sean Doherty while Mr Pavey is unavailable. The school is owned and operated by the Cognita group.  History  In 1939, North Bridge House School was founded as a Junior and Preparatory school in St. John's Wood. By the 1950s, the school had moved to 8 Neatherhall Gardens, Hampstead, which today houses the Pre-Prep (Junior) school. A re- organisation of the school during the 1960s resulted in the move of older Prep-School students to two Nash houses near Regent's Park. Around the same time, the nursery was opened in a Victorian villa on Fitzjohn's avenue, where it continues to operate today. Later, in 1987, the whole Prep-School was moved to a former covent in Gloucester Avenue, Primrose Hill, previously occupied by the Japanese School of London,\\"Which School?\\" Truman & Knightley Educational Trust, 1989. p.

In 2012, the Royal School, Hampstead, was merged with North Bridge House, its former location now the Hampstead Senior School. ¬£3.5m was invested in the redevelopment of the school, allowing for the refurbishment of the whole site, and the addition of specialist teaching facilities. ¬£1.7m was invested to provide the addition of a sports hall, which was completed in 2014, and opened by former Olympic Triple Jumper, Jonathan Edwards. In the same year, the North Bridge House Sixth Form was founded. It is situated in a 500 year old Grade II listed building in Canonbury, Islington, preparing students for university entry. This later expanded to include a senior school.  Present Day  North Bridge House school is operated by Cognita, which owns and operates private schools around the world. It is a mixed ability school, and admissions include an examination and interview by the headmaster. North Bridge House accepts international students, who come from other Cognita schools. In 2018, the Canonbury school achieved 70% 7-9 grades at GCSE, and 29% A-A* at A Level, and the Hampstead Senior School achieved 56% 7-9 at GCSE. North Bridge House consistently achieves high grades in Mathematics, English Literature and other creative subjects, such as art, drama and photography at GCSE. Extra-curricular activities are offered for students. Students can join the cast of the plays put on by the school, as well as forming bands for annual music competitions. Students can also take part in the Duke of Edinburgh award while at North Bridge House. There are sports teams which compete against other schools in England, and internationally. There are three houses: Veritas (blue), Fortis (yellow) and Decus (red). House competitions are organised, with students being able to score merits for their respective house throughout the year, the winner being awarded with a trip at the end of the year for the whole house to attend. The cost of attending the senior school is currently ¬£19,200 or ¬£22,830 for international students, including lunch, whilst the cost for attending the sixth form is ¬£19,335. Scholarships are offered to talented pupils, such as art, drama, music or mathematics scholarships. North Bridge House includes a Nursery, Pre-Prep, Prep, Senior and Sixth Form, allowing students to attend North Bridge House for their entire pre-university education.

He murdered three men during robberies of sub-post offices between 1971 and 1974, and murdered kidnap victim Lesley Whittle, an heiress from Highley, Shropshire, in January 1975. He was apprehended later that year, and sentenced to life imprisonment in July 1976, remaining in prison until his death in 2011. Early life Neilson, born Donald Nappey, was aged ten in January 1947 when his 33-year-old mother died from breast cancer. He was said to have had an unhappy childhood and was caught shopbreaking in 1948, but due to his age and circumstances was given a police caution or stern warning. He married 20-year-old Irene Tate in April 1955 at the age of 18. His wife persuaded him to leave the army where he was serving as a national serviceman in the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry. Their daughter, Kathryn, was born in 1960. Four years after his daughter's birth, Nappey changed the family name to Neilson so that the little girl would not suffer the bullying and abuse he had endured at school and in the army because of his surname's similarity to the word nappy. According to David Bell and Harry Hawkes, Nappey bought a taxi business from a man named Neilson and decided to use that name instead of the former. An alternative theory, proposed by a lodger, Lena Fearnley, who stayed with the Neilson family in the early 1960s, is that Neilson took the name from an ice- cream van from which he and Irene often bought ice-cream for their daughter. Fearnley told the BBC in an interview that he told her, \\"I like that name.\\" Burglary and robbery Neilson committed over 400 house burglaries without detection during his early days of crime. Before he became notorious as the \\"Black Panther\\" he was sought under a variety of nicknames such as \\"The Phantom\\" and \\"Handy Andy\\". To confuse the police, he adopted a different modus operandi every few weeks. For example, he would steal a radio from each house and abandon it nearby; when that pattern of behaviour was established, he would drop it and do something else. Proceeds from simple housebreaking were low, however, and after stealing guns and ammunition from a house in Cheshire, he upped his criminal activity, turning to robbing small post offices. Neilson committed eighteen such crimes between 1971 and 1974. His crimes became progressively more violent as he sought to protect himself from occupants prepared to resist and defend their property. In February 1972, he gained entry during the night to a sub-post office located in a private home in Rochdale Road, Heywood, Lancashire. Leslie Richardson, the postmaster, and his wife woke to find a hooded man in their bedroom. Richardson leapt out of bed to tackle the intruder while his wife phoned the police. During the struggle, Neilson showed Richardson his sawn-off shotgun and snapped in a fake West Indian accent, \\"This is loaded.\\" Richardson saw that the gun was pointing up at the ceiling and there was no danger of anyone being shot. He responded, \\"We'll find out if it's loaded\\", and pulled the trigger himself, blasting two holes in the ceiling. The fight continued and Richardson pulled off Neilson's black hood. Neilson stomped on Richardson's feet, breaking several toes, and kneed him in the groin. As Richardson collapsed on the floor, Neilson made his escape empty-handed. Richardson gave police a description of his masked intruder, which turned out to be inaccurate in many respects. Several other photofits of Neilson were similarly unhelpful to the police but one, made by sub-postmistress Margaret Grayland, was extremely accurate. First murders Neilson committed his first three murders in 1974. During post office robberies, he shot dead two sub-postmasters and the husband of a sub- postmistress, as well as brutally battering sub-postmistress Margaret Grayland. He killed Donald Skepper in Harrogate in February 1974,North Yorkshire Police website Derek Astin of Baxenden in September 1974, and Sidney Grayland in Langley, West Midlands during November 1974. The Baxenden murder resulted in Neilson being called the \\"Black Panther\\", as, during an interview with a local television reporter, Astin's wife Marion described her husband's killer as \\"so quick, he was like a panther\\". Alluding to the killer's dark clothing, the enterprising reporter ended his piece by asking \\"Where is this Black Panther?\\", and the nickname stuck. Neilson was linked to the post office shootings after he shot security guard Gerald Smith six times while checking a ransom trail.Smith died a year and a day after being shot Forensic examination showed the bullets were fired from the same .22 LR pistol used to murder both Astin and Grayland. Kidnap and murder of Lesley Whittle Lesley Whittle (1957 - 14 January 1975) was a 17-year-old girl when she became Neilson's youngest victim. Whittle was the daughter of noted coach transport business owner George Whittle and his mistress. Whittle had left his entire fortune to his mistress and their children, Ronald and Lesley. After reading about a family dispute over George Whittle's will, Neilson planned for three years to gain some of this fortune. On 14 January 1975, Neilson entered the Whittle family home in Highley, Shropshire, and kidnapped Lesley from her bedroom. Neilson calculated that the family would not materially miss ¬£50,000 of their fortune, and so made a subsequent demand for that sum in a note left at the family home. A series of police bungles and other circumstances resulted in Whittle's brother Ronald being unable to deliver the ransom money to the place and at the time demanded by the kidnapper. Lesley Whittle's body was found on 7 March 1975, hanging from a wire at the bottom of the drainage shaft where he had tethered her in Bathpool Park, at Kidsgrove, Staffordshire. The subsequent post-mortem examination showed that Whittle had died from vagal inhibition, not from strangulation. The shock of the fall had caused her heart to stop.Crime: An Encyclopedia p. 276 Some analysts thought it was possible Neilson pushed Whittle off the ledge where he had kept her. An alternative scenario is that Neilson was not present when Whittle died, and that he had panicked and fled on the night of the failed ransom collection without returning to the shaft, believing the police were closing in on him. Whittle may have lived in the dark for a considerable period of time before she fell to her death. The pathologist noted that Whittle weighed only when found, her stomach and intestines were completely empty, she had lost a considerable amount of weight and was emaciated. He concluded that she had not eaten for a minimum of three days, the length of time it takes for food to pass through the body, but said the actual duration may have been much longer. In his closing speech for the defence, Gilbert Gray QC described the conditions that Neilson provided for Whittle, noting ways that he tried to provide for her comfort. For instance, he asked the jury whether they believed any hangman's noose would be padded and lagged with seventy-seven-and-a-half inches of Elastoplast to avoid chafing, or that any scaffold would be cushioned for comfort by a rubber mattress and sleeping bags. He noted that Whittle would not have died if the wire had not snagged on a stanchion, because her feet were only six inches from the bottom of the shaft, the QC said: \\"This is not something the defence has made up. Her height from the neck was four feet and there was a five feet length of ligature giving an overall length of nine feet. The drop from the landing to the floor of the tunnel was six feet eleven inches, so that if it had not been for the unforeseen snagging which shortened the tether, there would have been two feet to spare and she would have landed on her feet at the bottom of the shaft.\\" He asked the jury why Neilson bothered to keep her alive once he had recorded the ransom messages, saying he could have simply clubbed her to death and hidden the body in woodland. Gray finished his speech by saying, \\"I submit that when Lesley Whittle went over the platform it was an unlooked for misadventure, unplanned and undesired. Neilson started something that went hideously wrong.\\"A History of Policing in England and Wales from 1974: A Turbulent Journey p. 45 Capture and arrest In December 1975 two police officers, Tony White and Stuart Mackenzie, were in a panda car in a side road keeping a watch on the main A60 trunk road leading out of Mansfield in north Nottinghamshire when they spotted a small wiry man passing who carried a holdall. As he passed the police car he averted his face, drawing Mackenzie's attention. As a matter of routine, they called him over to question him. The man said he was on his way home from work, then produced a sawn-off shotgun from the holdall. He ordered White into the back of the car. The policeman opened the car door but the gunman snapped, \\"No time for that, climb the seat!\\" The officer did so and the gunman settled into the passenger seat, jamming the gun into Mackenzie's armpit. He ordered them to drive to Rainworth, six miles away, and told them not to look at him. This presented Mackenzie with a problem. Gently he explained to the gunman that they were going the wrong way and he would have to turn the car around. The gunman agreed but warned both officers if there were any tricks, they would both be dead. As they were driving along Southwell Road, the gunman asked if they had any rope. As White pretended to look, Mackenzie reached a junction in the road. Turning the steering wheel violently one way then the other, he asked, \\"Which way, left or right?\\" causing the gunman to look toward the road ahead. White saw the gun drop a few inches and realised this was his chance; he pushed the gun forwards and Mackenzie stamped on the brake. They screeched to a halt outside the 'Junction Chip Shop' in Rainworth. The gun went off, grazing White's hand. Mackenzie fell out of the driver's seat, banging his head on the road. He staggered to his feet and ran towards the fish and chip shop screaming for help. Two men, Roy Morris and Keith Wood, ran from the queue outside the chip shop and helped overpower Neilson. Wood subdued the gunman with a blow to the neck before Morris grabbed his wrists and held them for White to snap on the handcuffs. The locals attacked him so severely that in the end the police had to protect him. They hauled Neilson to iron railings at the side of a bus stop and handcuffed him there before calling for back-up. In the subsequent investigation, Neilson's fingerprints were found to match one of those in the drain shaft. In the interview at Kidsgrove police station when he confessed to the kidnap of Whittle, Neilson gave an 18-page statement to DCS Harold Wright, head of Staffordshire CID, and Commander Morrison of Scotland Yard, with the statement handwritten by DCI Walter Boreham. Trial and conviction During his trial at Oxford Crown Court, Neilson's defence lawyer Gilbert Gray QC contended that Whittle had accidentally fallen from the ledge and died as a result. He noted that Neilson had fed her chicken soup, spaghetti and meatballs, and bought her fish and chips, chicken legs and Polo mints. The prosecution contested these claims. Evidence showed that Neilson had provided his victim with a sleeping bag designed to prevent hypothermia, mattresses, survival blankets, survival bags, a bottle of brandy, six paperback books, a copy of the Times and two magazines for reading, a small puzzle, and two brightly coloured napkins. These items were found in the shaft, and in the subterranean canal running below it, by the police. In July 1976, Neilson was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of Lesley Whittle, for which he was given a life sentence. Three weeks later he was convicted of the murders of two postmasters and the husband of a postmistress. In total, Neilson received five life sentences. The judge, Mr Justice Mars-Jones, also gave Neilson a further 61 years: 21 years for kidnapping Lesley Whittle and 10 years for blackmailing her mother. Three further sentences of 10 years each were imposed for the two burglary charges, when he stole guns and ammunition, and for possessing the sawn-off shotgun with intent to endanger life. All the sentences were to run concurrently. The judge told Neilson that the enormity of his crimes put him in a class apart from almost all other convicted murderers in recent years. Neilson's defence team, solicitor, Barrington Black, junior counsel, Norman Jones and leading counsel Gilbert Gray, all claimed that his conviction was a reflection of public opinion, a backlash of the publicity given to the hunt for the kidnapper and killer and that he should have been convicted only of the lesser charge of manslaughter.Harry Hawkes, The Capture of the Black Panther, Chapter 7, page 241. Neilson was acquitted of the attempted murders of sub-postmistress Margaret Grayland and PC Tony White, but found guilty of the lesser alternative charges of inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mrs Grayland and of possessing a shotgun with the intent of endangering life at Mansfield. A charge of attempting to murder security guard Gerald Smith, whom Neilson shot six times while checking the Whittle ransom trail, was not pursued due to legal complications. Smith died more than a year and a day after being shot. The trial judge recommended that Neilson receive a whole life tariff. After the verdicts, Gray visited his client in a cell below the courthouse, and found Neilson in the corner of his cell curled up in a foetal position, purportedly dejected and allegedly filled with remorse for Whittle and her family. Trial and conviction of Irene Neilson According to Harry Hawkes, when Donald Neilson was first caught in Mansfield, his wife Irene became worried when he failed to return home. Irene burned around fifty postal orders in their coal fire. Police noticed the charred remains within the chimney when the house was later searched. Irene Neilson was later convicted of cashing over eighty stolen postal orders stolen in one of her husband's post office raids. She claimed to have been forced into cashing these items in various post offices over a large area. Her solicitor, Barrington Black, placed the blame squarely on Donald Neilson's complete domination of his wife, describing him as a \\"Svengali, who had exercised a hypnotic influence.\\" He added, \\"He was a quasi military figure who barked orders at his wife and daughter and woe betide anyone who disobeyed him.\\" The solicitor said he felt this portrayal was confirmed by Donald Neilson when he had visited him in his top security cell. It seemed a formality that Irene, then aged 42 with no previous convictions, would be placed on probation. But a court report said that probation would not be suitable. Black pressed hard for Irene Neilson to be fined, asking the magistrates if she really deserved to be harshly treated for a situation that was forced upon her, and saying her last three years with Neilson before his arrest had been \\"hell\\". The magistrates said that while they had every sympathy with a lady before the courts for the first time, they regarded her activities as a deliberate course of conduct. She received twelve months in prison per official court records. An appeal was immediately lodged. Gilbert Gray QC was briefed to represent her, and he produced Donald Neilson as a surprise witness. The QC told the judge, sitting with two magistrates, that he was anxious that the court should be aware of the pressure and constraints placed upon Mrs Neilson as a result of her husband. He said, Neilson \\"was the man who struck fear and dread into pretty much the whole community and this woman lived with him\\". But the judges found Donald Neilson's testimony to have a \\"vagueness\\", and they upheld his wife's conviction and sentence. While Irene was in prison, a major newspaper paid a large amount for the Neilsons' story. Six years later, in an interview with The Sunday People, Irene Neilson claimed that she doubted she would have been jailed had she not been Neilson's wife. She said everyone had wanted blood after her husband's trial. In the event, she served eight months before being released with full remission for good behaviour. =2008 appeal for Neilson= Following subsequent legal judgements in various other cases, and the implications of European Union Human Rights laws, Neilson was confirmed on numerous occasions to be on the Home Office's list of prisoners with whole life tariffs. A succession of Home Secretaries ruled that life should mean life for Neilson. In 2008, Neilson applied to the High Court to have his minimum term reverted to 30 years. On 12 June 2008, Mr Justice Teare upheld the whole life tariff, saying: Death In the early hours of 17 December 2011, Neilson was taken from Norwich Prison to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital with breathing difficulties. He was pronounced dead the next day. In popular culture Neilson's life and crimes were portrayed in the 1977 film The Black Panther, starring Donald Sumpter as Neilson. It was released on DVD in 2012. A fictionalised account of the Whittle kidnapping and Neilson's trial forms the basis of Adam Mars-Jones's short-story \\"Bathpool Park,\\" which attempted to show how the court and judge had \\"missed the point.\\" Mars-Jones's father, Sir William Mars-Jones, presided over the trial, and Adam Mars-Jones served as his father's marshal.

The bird, endemic to eastern Australia, has a broad distribution, occupying areas from Cape York, Queensland, throughout New South Wales and Victoria to Port Augusta and the Flinders Ranges, South Australia. Prevalent nowadays between 16ÀöS and 38ÀöS, the population has contracted from the edges of its pre-European range, declining in Adelaide and Cape York. Found in a diverse range of habitats varying from coastal forests to mallee shrub-lands, the brown treecreeper often occupies eucalypt-dominated woodland habitats up to , avoiding areas with a dense shrubby understorey. Taxonomy Coenraad Jacob Temminck and Meiffren Laugier de Chartrouse described the brown treecreeper in 1824, and it still bears its original name today. It is one of six species of treecreeper found in Australia, and is most closely related to the rufous treecreeper (Climacteris rufus) of Western Australia and the black- tailed treecreeper (C. melanurus). All three occupy similar savannah and open woodland habitat, and have a sexually dimorphic marking on the upper breast or throat (black in the male, reddish in the female). They are thought to have been separated by breaks in suitable habitat in the past and hence diverged genetically. Three subspecies have been described ‚Äì subspecies picumnus is broadly distributed from the Grampians, Victoria, through central New South Wales to the Bunya Mountains, Queensland. The subspecies can be found in coastal catchments and drier areas on and west of the Great Divide, intergrading with subspecies victoriae, which is found on the Great Dividing Range from south-east Queensland to the Grampians, Victoria. Subspecies melanotus occurs from Cape York Peninsula south to near Cooktown, Queensland. Known as the black treecreeper, it has distinctive sooty brown plumage and is slightly smaller than the southern subspecies. Woodpecker is a colloquial name, from its habit of spiralling up treetrunks. Conservation status The conservation status of the brown treecreeper is considered of \\"least concern\\" by the IUCN, while the subspecies victoriae, is listed in New South Wales as Vulnerable under Schedule 2 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act (1995). Subspecies victoriae is listed by the Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria, as Near-threatened on the Advisory List of Threatened Vertebrate Fauna though this listing does not infer any statutory protection. Description Adult birds are around long, with a wingspan of , and weigh on average around . Adult plumage is light grey-brown above with light grey face and neck, darker grey on the crown with dark ear-coverts. The supercilium is prominent and pale on adults, while grey and indistinct on juveniles. The throat is cream to white and pale brown on the breast. The lower breast is streaked with fine black-grey and white. In flight a dark wing-bar is visible. Sexes of the species differ in plumage, with the uppermost breast of the male streaked black and white, while the female has rufous and white streaking. Juvenile plumage is different from that on the adult with the hind-neck, nape, crown and forehead darker than that of adult males. The call has been described as a spink spink. Social organisation and feeding behaviour Brown treecreeper foraging on a tree Gregarious with a complex social structure between individuals and breeding groups, the species maintains a territory which sometimes overlaps with other brown treecreeper groups. Usually observed in pairs or a small group of up to eight individuals, incursions by other groups of brown treecreeper are often tolerated by residents of the same species. Roosting nocturnally and solitarily, the brown treecreeper forages during the day on the ground and on tree surfaces in small groups or pairs, feeding mainly on ants, beetles and insect larvae. While occasionally feeding on nectar, the brown treecreeper more often probes fissures, cracks and hollows of trees, gleaning and probing as it hops along logs or spirals up rough barked trees, spending more time foraging on the ground if a resident of an arid territory. Nesting The brown treecreeper breeds cooperatively and usually forms a long-term socially monogamous pair. Both sexes are able to breed in their first year, with the female usually finding a mate within two years and the male usually obtaining a breeding position sometime after three years. The breeding season lasts from July to February with the majority of eggs laid from September until late October. Incubating is undertaken by the breeding female only. The nest is usually located in a tree hollow beneath a canopy, often nearby the boundary of another brown treecreeper territory to attract extra help feeding. Building of the nest is undertaken by all members of the group over a period of 1‚Äì2 weeks. Nest materials consist of twigs, grass, leaves, bark, dung, animal fur and sometimes human refuse such as aluminum foil. One bird has been recorded collecting fur from a live possum. During building of the nest the breeding female usually transports the heavier nest materials and may discard material delivered by other members of the group. Breeding right The breeding female usually lays a clutch-size usually of three smooth (sometimes two or four), slightly glossy, fine-grained, slightly pink or rose, reddish-brown or red and purplish-red speckled eggs measuring 22.6 by 17.9 mm. Intervals between egg-laying is most likely 24 hours, with re-laying occurring in the event of failure. Females are able to raise two broods in a season but more often raise one brood. Hatchlings emerge with grey down on their head and back fourteen to sixteen days after incubation. For a few days after hatching, the female is fed by the primary male. The young are fed by the breeding female who is passed food by the primary male. Faecal sacs are removed from the nest by all members of the group though most often it is the males who do so. Helpers, usually young males related to the breeding male, service their territorial nest and often will service other nests in 2‚Äì3 other territories. A variety of insects are fed to the young, with lepidopteran larvae forming the bulk of their diet. Adults avoid feeding the young ants, likely due to the ant's formic acid content. The contribution of helpers to feeding the young is generally equal to the efforts of the breeding pair. Records exist of a single helper servicing the nests of five different territories. Records indicate that in nests attended by helpers, breeding success is four times more likely and significantly more offspring are produced. Fledging and dispersal Chicks fledge between 21 and 26 days most likely over a period of a few hours. Initially not able to fly strongly, the fledglings roost in hollows and spouts of trees for one or two days, and are fed by members of the group until independent thirty to forty days later. In a season, breeding groups successfully produce at least one fledgling 50% of the time. The first moult to adult plumage occurs two months after fledging, while adults start moulting in November or February, finishing in March or April. Natal dispersal occurs after winter when most females will disperse to locate an area to breed. Dispersal by males of the species rarely occurs and they commonly remain in their natal territory as helpers until a breeding vacancy arises by inheritance or by territorial budding (when a male paired with a dispersing female inherits a portion of his natal territory). Females disperse earlier than males moving further than the males (up to ) to establish a breeding territory. Threats to the species Threats to the species include land clearing and the resultant habitat loss and fragmentation, the impacts of which are thought to disrupt dispersal and therefore recruitment. The removal of fallen timber and other woody debris, and competition with exotic species such as the common starling for nesting hollows are also threats to the species. Subspecies melanotus has declined from eastern parts of its range in Cape York Peninsula, thought to be due to more extensive and frequent fire regime, which has affected fallen tree trunks and logs (a preferred foraging substrate for this species).

After Lithuanians and Samogitians soundly defeated the joint forces of the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order in the Battle of Durbe in 1260, the Prussians rose against their conquerors once again. Prussian tribes agreed to cooperate and elected their leaders. The Great Prussian Uprising started on September 20, 1260. The Teutonic Order called crusaders from Germany and Poland for help and the first large army of reinforcements arrived in January 1261. The army was split into two groups: one, led by the Count of Barby, to operate in Sambia and the other, under the leadership of the Count of Reyden, to operate in Natangia. The Teutonic group in Natangia met little resistance and split into two groups so that they could cover a larger territory more effectively. Though a common practice, it was a tactical mistake, because Herkus Monte, the leader of the Natangians, had been educated in Germany and expected this development. As soon as one group departed, he attacked and defeated the other. The first group had to retreat. The very next day the Teutonic group dispatched to Sambia was also defeated. This way the first wave of Teutonic reinforcements was wiped out and the Knights were in distress. The uprising spread further and intensified.

Despite not having produced any original music before, Knuckles agreed to work on it after hearing a demo tape version by Principle. Knuckles would take the song and add some small music to it and play to great reception at his club. This version of the song was played from tapes and was described as being different from later releases, with Jacob Arnold of Wax Poetics stated that this version was \\"little more than a snare march with vocals.\\" It was later revamped by DJ Mark \\"Hot Rod\\" Trollan who added a synthesizer intro and a bassline. This version was first released in 1986 on Persona Records and was the last release from the label. The song is commonly known as a track by Frankie Knuckles, despite the lesser-known Principle releasing it first. The song was re-released on Trax Records and credited to Frankie Knuckles with Principle only being credited as the songwriter. The Trax release and the Persona release have little difference between them. The song did not create a wave of house music in Chicago, which did not start until the release of \\"On and On\\" by Jesse Saunders. Production =Background= The song was made by a Chicago-based musician named Bryan Walton under the alias of Jamie Principle. Principle, a Chicago native and was part of the city's music scene that predominantly revolved around gay and black nightclubs. Principle was not homosexual, and said he was not very familiar with gay culture at the time. He went to college for sound engineering and considered his favourite musicians to be Prince, David Bowie, Depeche Mode and The Human League. Frankie Knuckles was originally from New York, but would work as a DJ at the Chicago clubs, initially at the Warehouse from 1977 to 1982 and then at the Power Plant which Knuckles owned and operated. Princple did not know Knuckles personally before working with him on \\"Your Love\\", but positively recalled attending these clubs stating that during the Reagan Era, these clubs were \\"a place to escape. You could stay out all night and not worry about what was happening here. When Frankie [Knuckles] had his Power Plant club, it was like going to church and letting yourself be free without worrying about all the craziness that was happening in the streets and in the world.\\" =Writing and development= Principle explained that the songs lyrics were developed when he decided he would focus less on relationships to remain more focused on making music. Principle would then meet a girl named Lisa, who the song is about. Walton began writing \\"Your Love\\" as a poem about her, but later switched into a song that was written just for her. The original lyrics were voiced by an uncredited Adrienne Jette, a vocalist whose only other credits was on Ron Hardy's \\"Sensation\\". Principle's friend Freddy Gomez engineered the song and cut a tape of it on reel-to-reel. Gomez took the song to Knuckles, who Principle did not know personally at the time. Principle recalled that he was \\"afraid of Frankie, because I heard that if he didn't like the songs, he would just tear them up in front of you.\\" Gomez worked with Knuckles regularly and took the song to him without Principle knowing and said Knuckles would get in touch with him after listening to it. Prior to working with Principle, Knuckles had not attempted to produce anyone's music before and was initially hesitant to do so. Knuckles found that Principle's lyrics were \\"like books, small books. He would come in with pages and pages and pages of lyrics for one song.\\" Knuckles stated he trimmed the lyrics, believing that he was attempting to \\"try and thin this out and concentrate on what‚Äôs sweet about it, what‚Äôs innocent about it, what‚Äôs natural about it.‚Äù Gomez stated that Knuckles contribution to the song was by adding a lot of material, as the original version was about three minutes long. Knuckles recalled that they re-recorded everything from scratch with his partner Eric Kupper who lived in Connecticut. When asked about the production of the song, Knuckles felt that he didn‚Äôt know what he was doing when developing the track. The music was recorded to a cassette tape. Music and additional production \\"Your Love\\" was played in clubs from tape for over a year before being released on vinyl. Jacob Arnold of Wax Poetics stated that this cassette tape version played that played in the Power Plant was \\"little more than a snare march with vocals.\\" For the first purchasable release, DJ Mark \\"Hot Rod\\" Trollan who had previously done remixing work for hire, was brought in to work on the track. Trollan added much of the material to the song including its synthesizer intro and a bass line that was inspired by an obscure Italo-disco track \\"Feels Good (Carrots & Beets)\\" by Electra. Despite there being different major separate releases credited to both Principle and Knuckles, the two versions of \\"Your Love\\" on Persona and Trax were declared to only have \\"some small differences, all the versions are basically the same\\" by Coleman with both these versions beginning with arpeggiated lead followed by a bassline. The other track on some releases of the song was \\"Baby Wants to Ride\\". Principle described the song as about \\"spirituality, sexuality, and political views on topics like the draft and that the government was not accepting everyone's rights. Principle recalled that \\"I felt like I had to voice that at the time. It was just my own frustration. It was hard for me to be the individual person that I wanted to be.\\" Principle grew up in what he described as a strict Christian household and the sexuality themed lyrics of the song also dealt with him \\"dealing with the whole thing of sex before marriage; I was intertwining a lot of personal issues that I had into one song.\\" Release The early versions of \\"Your Love\\" without the added production from Trollan was played in clubs from tape for over a year before being released on vinyl. When it as played at Chicago clubs, the audience was generally unaware it was a Chicago-based artist, believing that the song originated in Europe. Though a misunderstanding in the latter part of the 1980s over how the songs were credited and listed commercially, with some tracks from this period including \\"Your Love\\" being credited differently with subsequent releases. The initial version on Persona Records is credited to Jamie Principle while later releases on Trax Records are credited to Frankie Knuckles. Persona Records was created in 1984 and co- owned by Danny Alias, who after working as a student teacher connected with some music attorneys and became a paralegal. Alias was a fan of into the Chicago dance music clubs as well as being a fan of artists like Yoko Ono and Klaus Nomi as well as recording and reading poems over dance music. At a Chicago release party the Alias' song \\"Civil Defense\\" on the label, he met Knuckles who wanted him and his partner David Bell to sign Jamie Principle. The label released his first single \\"Waiting on My Angel\\" in May 1985. Principle's version of \\"Your Love\\" was first released as being credited to Jamie Principle on a 12\\" vinyl record in April 1986 on Persona Records. It was the third and final release on Persona Records. Alias stated that due to doing business in Chicago led to problems as despite selling many copies of Jamie Principle's records, there were issues with \\"let's just say...mob control.\\" The later release credited to Frankie Knuckles was released in 1987 on Trax Records, with Principle received writing credit for ‚ÄúYour Love‚Äù and both of them getting writing credits for the other song on the single ‚ÄúBaby Wants to Ride‚Äù. Principle performed the uncredited vocals on the Knuckles version. Principle responded to the release on Trax decades later, stating he had \\"never been signed to Trax! So they literally just stole my stuff.\\" Reception and legacy In a contemporary review, Brian Chin of Billboard praised Principle's record as a \\"street record of astonighing accomplishment, one that gets better as it goes along.\\" Chin noted the \\"lush European feel of the vocal version is counterbalanced by the 11-minute perc-apella mix (by Mark \\"Hot Rod\\" Tollan), totally vocal-less and absorbing\\" The release of \\"Your Love\\" did not lead to a wave of house music musical imitations, as it was not until the release of Jesse Saunders' track \\"On and On\\" that more musicians emulated the style. Bill Brewton and Frank Brewster wrote in their book that Last Night a DJ Saved My Life that music of this era in Chicago only grew after it demanded a stream of what Broughton described as \\"simple, repetitive drum tracks\\" and as people began to realize how basic a track could be and as equipment became more affordable, then people began submitting endless tapes to DJs. Marshall Jefferson stated that with \\"Your Love\\" did not inspire anybody to make a similar record, as \\"His shit was too good. It was like seeing John Holmes in a porno movie. You know you can't do better.\\" Principle said that when Knuckles played \\"Your Love\\" to the audiences at the clubs, he felt the song had been validated due to the positive response to it. He recalled that \\"it was like God told me, \\"This is what you're supposed to be doing.\\"\\" Principle and Knuckles would collaborate on another track in the 1980s titled \\"Bad Boy\\". Jefferson continued that the success of \\"On and On\\" led to a wave of imitators, stating that \\"They saw somebody make it big...But not be that great. When Jesse did his stuff, everybody said, \\"Fuck! I could to better than that!\\" \\"Your Love\\" became the background music to the song \\"You Got the Love\\" by The Source who mixed it with a song featuring vocals by Candi Staton. which was a hit song in the United Kingdom 1991. Following Knuckles' death on March 31, 2014, the song re-entered the UK Singles Chart at number 29, beating its 1989 position of number 59.

In this context, it refers to corruption created by humans, as an embodiment of the 'Left Hand of Allah' (wrath) in relevance to tanzih (transcendence). This corruption can only be wrought by humans, as they are made of clay, which can manifest darkness and evil. The antonym of fasid is salih (wholesomeness) or salihat (wholesome deeds). One manifestation of fasid is the human desire to control nature. Since nature, as with all things, is under the government of Allah, such an attempt becomes an act of insubordination and a rejection of Allah's Will.

It consists of a top piece that covers the torso and hangs down over the legs. A dress can be any one- piece garment containing a skirt of any length, and can be formal or casual. A dress can have sleeves, straps, or be held up with elastic around the chest, leaving the shoulders bare. Dresses also vary in color. The hemlines of dresses vary depending on modesty, weather, fashion or the personal taste of the wearer.  About  Dresses are outer garments made up of a bodice and a skirt and can be made in one or more pieces. Dresses are generally suitable for both casual and formal wear in the West for women and girls. Historically, dresses could also include other items of clothing such as corsets, kirtles, partlets, petticoats, smocks, and stomachers. History = 11th century = In the 11th century, women in Europe wore dresses that were similar to men's tunics and were loose, with a hemline reaching to below the knees or lower. By the end of the century, these dresses featured a tighter fit on the arms and women's upper bodies. Dresses were made snug by featuring slits on the sides of the dress that were pulled tight in order to fit a woman's figure. = 16th century = Starting in the 1550s, middle- and upper-class women in Europe wore dresses which included a smock, stays, kirtle, gown, forepart, sleeves, ruff and a partlet. Undergarments were not worn underneath. In England, Queen Elizabeth dictated what kinds of dresses women were allowed to wear. French women were inspired by Spanish-style bodices and also wore ruffs. French dresses were known as marlottes. In Italy, dresses were known as ropa and semarra. Dresses in the 16th century also displayed surface decoration such as embroidery, with blackwork being especially popular. Women's dresses in Russia during both the 16th and 17th centuries identified a woman's place in society or their family. = 17th century = Holland, as a center of textile production, was a particularly noted area of innovation in dress fashion during the 17th Century. In Spain and Portugal, women wore stomachers while in England and France, dresses became more \\"naturally\\" shaped. Lace and slashing were popular decorations. Skirts were full, with regular folds and the overskirt allowed the display of an underskirt of contrasting fabric. Necklines became lower as well. Embroidery that reflected scientific discoveries, such as newly discovered animals and plants were popular. In the British Colonies, multi-piece dresses were also popular, though less luxurious. Wealthy women living in the Spanish or Dutch colonies in the Americas copied the fashions that were popular from their homelands. The three-piece dress, which had a bodice, petticoat and gown, was popular until the last 25 years of the century, in which the mantua, or a one-piece gown, became more popular. Corsets became more important in dresses by the 1680s. Working women, and women in slavery in the Americas, used simple patterns to create shifts, wool or linen petticoats and gowns and cotton dresses. The bottoms of the skirts could be tucked into the waistband when a woman was near a cooking or heating fire. = 18th century = Illustration of 18th century French women Large, triangular silhouettes were favored during the 18th century, skirts were wide and supported by hoop underskirts. One-piece gowns remained popular until the middle of the century. During the 1760s in France, hoop petticoats were reduced in size. Lighter colors and lighter fabrics were also favored. In Colonial America, women most often wore a gown and petticoat, in which the skirt of the gown opened to reveal the petticoat underneath. Women also had riding habits which consisted of the petticoat, jacket and a waistcoat. French fashion regarding dresses became very fast-changing during the later part of the 18th century. Throughout this period, the length of fashionable dresses varied only slightly, between ankle-length and floor- sweeping. Between 1740 and 1770, the robe √† la fran√ßaise was very popular with upper-class women. In France, the Empire style became popular after the French Revolution. This more simple style was also favored by Josephine Bonaparte, wife of Napoleon. Other popular styles during the revolution included tunic dresses and the neglig√©e √† la patriot, which featured the red, white and blue colors of the flag. =19th century= Empire dress, 1800‚Äì1805, cotton and linen, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City) Women's dresses in the 19th century began to be classified by the time of day or purpose of the dress. High-waisted dresses were popular until around 1830. Early nineteenth century dresses in Russia were influenced by Classicism and were made of thin fabrics, with some semi-transparent. Elizabeth Vig√©e Le Brun wore these types of dresses with a short skirt (reaching to her ankles) when she lived in Russia between 1785 and 1801 and many Russian women copied her style. By the 1840s, Russian women were turning to what was in fashion in Europe. Europeans styles in dresses increased dramatically to the hoopskirt and crinoline- supported styles of the 1860s, then fullness was draped and drawn to the back. Dresses had a \\"day\\" bodice with a high neckline and long sleeves, and an \\"evening\\" bodice with a low neckline (decollete) and very short sleeves. In Russia, metal hoopskirts were known as \\"malakhovs.\\" Skirts of the 1860s were heavily decorated. To sleep, women in the American West wore floor-length dresses of white cotton with high collars displaying decoration. Various Native American people, such as the Navajo and the Mescalero Apache began to adapt the designs of their dresses to look more like the European Americans they came in contact with. Navajo women further adapted the European designs, incorporating their own sense of beauty, \\"creating h√≥zh√≥.\\" Paper sewing patterns for women to sew their own dresses started to be readily available in the 1860s, when the Butterick Publishing Company began to promote them. These patterns were graded by size, which was a new innovation. The Victorian era's dresses were tight-fitting and decorated with pleats, rouching and frills. Women in the United States who were involved in dress reform in the 1850s found themselves the center of attention, both positive and negative. By 1881, the Rational Dress Society had formed in reaction to the restrictive dress of the era. =20th century= French afternoon dress, circa 1903, cotton and silk, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City) In the early twentieth century, the look popularized by the Gibson Girl was fashionable. The upper part of women's dresses in the Edwardian era included a \\"pigeon breast\\" look that gave way to a corseted waist and an s-shaped silhouette. Women called their dresses \\"waists\\" if one-piece, or \\"shirtwaists,\\" if it consisted of a skirt and a blouse. The bodice of the dresses had a boned lining. Informally, wealthy women wore tea gowns at home. These garments were looser, though not as loose as a \\"wrapper,\\" and made of expensive fabric and laces. By 1910, the Edwardian look was replaced with a straighter silhouette. French designer, Paul Poiret, had a huge impact on the look of the time. Designs developed by Poiret were available in both boutiques and also in department stores. Popular dresses of the time were one-piece and included lingerie dresses which could be layered. At around the same time, in the United States, the American Ladies Tailors' Association developed a dress called the suffragette suit, which was practical for women to work and move around in. Another innovation of the 1910s was the ready availability of factory-made clothing. Waistlines started out high and by 1915 were below the natural waist. By 1920, waistlines were at hip-level. Between 1910 and 1920 necklines were lower and dresses could be short-sleeved or sleeveless. Women who worked during World War I preferred shorter dresses, which eventually became the dominant style overall. In addition to the shorter dresses, waistlines were looser and the dominant colors were black, white and gray. By 1920, the \\"new woman\\" was a trend that saw lighter fabrics and dresses that were easier to put on. Younger women were also setting the trends that older women started to follow. The dresses of the 1920s could be pulled over the head, were short and straight. It was acceptable to wear sleeveless dresses during the day. Flapper dresses were popular until end of the decade. During World War II, dresses were slimmer and inspired by military uniforms. After WWII, the New Look, promoted by Christian Dior was very influential on fashion and the look of women's dresses for about a decade. Since the 1970s, no one dress type or length has dominated fashion for long, with short and ankle-length styles often appearing side by side in fashion magazines and catalogs. Use In most varieties of formal dress codes in Western cultures, a dress of an appropriate style is mandatory for women. They are also very popular for special occasions such as proms or weddings. For such occasions they, together with blouse and skirt, remain the de facto standard attire for many girls and women. =Basic dress= A basic dress is a usually dark-colored dress of simple design which can be worn with various accessories to suit different occasions. Different kinds of jewelry, belts, scarves, and jackets can be worn with the basic dress to dress up or down. A little black dress is an example of a basic dress. =Bodycon dress= Dresses in the 1930s. A promotional model in a bodycon dress.

The Venetian tradition that this was the founding of the Biblioteca Marciana is an anachronism; it was founded a century later. Petrarch's books When Petrarch broke up his personal collections at Parma and Vaucluse he had formed the habit of traveling with large bales of manuscripts in a long cavalcade. In his middle age he became tired of carrying his large collection of manuscripts and books around in his extensive travels. He came to the conclusion that he would offer his collection of manuscripts to the Republic of Venice, on condition that it should be properly housed, and should never be sold or divided. This was in exchange for a permanent residence that he and his daughter's family could live in.The Age of Petrarch He decided he wanted to have his valuable collection of manuscripts and ancient books put into a public library on the concept of those of classical antiquity, like Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who built the Library of Alexandria. He called on his Venetian friend Grand Chancellor Benintendi de Ravagnani on this matter. Benintendi enthusiastically took on the idea of receiving Petrarch's books and manuscripts. He immediately prepared the Deliberation for the Great Council meeting in the beginning of September 1362 on this issue. It gave its approval for the donation of Petrarch's books to the church of Saint Mark (Marciana) as the protector of this precious gift, being the symbol of Venice. Palazzo Molina The agreement between Petrarch and the Republic of Venice was that none of the ancient books nor Petrarch's manuscripts were to be dispersed. They were to be preserved in a safe place in memory and honor of the great poet. In return for this Petrarch was to have the use of a worthy residence at public expense during his lifetime. Petrarch received the Palazzo Molina, known locally as Casa Molin delle due Torri. The memorandum agreement stipulated that Petrarch could keep his library until his death and did not say he had to live in Venice. Petrarch and his daughter Francesca with his son-in-law Francescuolo da Brossano moved there in 1362. It became their prime residence from 1362 to 1367 along with his personal library of books and manuscripts. Petrarch's library was then transferred to the quayside of Riva degli Schiavoni. This collection had about two hundred codices. This is actually thought to be a much higher number of titles however, given that a codex often contained more than one work within it. The library included as much of early antiquities and early Christian culture as Petrarch had been able to select over ten years of assiduous studying, research in the monastic libraries, and in his journeys of discovery. All this fit perfectly to form the ideal library of a man of culture and integrated in with Petrarch's humanism. Sometime in the year 1367, however, Petrarch decided to leave Venice because the local scholars were not interested in his personal library. Venetian scholars were more interested in scientific knowledge rather than humanistic culture. It could also be because of Petrarch's habitual restlessness to move on to different ventures, or because of the plague then ravaging Venice, or because of the war that broke out between Venice and Padua at that time, or even because he held a canonry in Padua. When Petrarch left Venice in 1368, he settled in the territory of Padua, normally hostile to Venice; Petrarch's biographer concludes that the agreement with Venice was abrogated at this point.Morris Bishop, Petrarch and his World, 1963, p. 360. Petrarch built himself a small house about ten miles outside of Arqu√†, in Paduan territory. A little vineyard with some olive trees were sufficient for his modest household needs at this time. While his health was poor he eased his mind by reading and prepared for the end. There he wrote to his beloved brother Gerard admiring his faithful religious duties. At this point in his life he seems to have given up his love for fine books along with other vanities of the world. On July 19, 1374 Petrarch died peacefully at Arqua alone in his library. His few remaining manuscripts were dispersed. Some of them may be seen in Rome, Paris, London, or the Vatican. Those which he had given to the Republic of Venice in the \\"agreement\\" suffered a strange reverse of fortune. The collection was left neglected for centuries at the Palazzo Molina, Petrarch's past residence. Many of the manuscripts and ancient books had crumbled to powder and others had petrified because of the damp conditions of the storage facilities. Some were even glued into shapeless masses.The Story of Old Books The antiquary Tomasini found some of Petrarch's books cast aside in a dark room behind the \\"Horses of Lysippos\\". The surviving ancient manuscripts were placed in the Libraria Vecchia and are now in Doge's Palace. Many of Petrarch's manuscripts and books found their way to Gian Galeazzo Visconti's personal library in Pavia, later moved to Paris.

Artist-run centre is the common term of use for artist-initiated and managed organizations in Canada. Most centres follow the not-for-profit arts organization model, do not charge admission fees, pay artists for their contributions (exhibitions, presentations, performances) are non-commercial and de-emphasize the selling of artwork. Origins The centres were created originally in response to a lack of opportunity to present contemporary work, especially in the 1960s and 1970s experimental art practices such as performance, installation, conceptual art and video in Canada and with the desire to network with other artists nationally and internationally.http://goodreads.timothycomeau.com/aabronson/#1def Bronson, AA \\"The Humiliation of the Bureaucrat: Artist-Run Centres as Museums by Artists.\\" Museums by Artists. AA Bronson and Peggy Gale, eds. Art Metropole, Toronto 1983. The early artist-run centres in Canada were critical of the commodification of traditional art forms exhibited in mainstream galleries and institutions which did not show emerging and experimental works, interdisciplinary practices or the works of marginalized artists. In the 1990s there were over 100 artist-run centres across Canada. Today there are at least 60 artist-run centres with continuous operating funding. Similar artist-run organizations have been developed worldwide. In the US, they are commonly identified by the term artist-run space and in Australia by the term artist- run initiative (ARI). Focus Each artist-run centre has a unique program, but most present contemporary art by Canadian and international artists, often in combination with critical writing and other public events such as lectures, performances, screenings, etc. The centres have tended to focus on emerging artists and artists working outside the commercial gallery system. Some centres have been developed to support creative production, particularly in the areas of video, new media, photography and printmaking. Support =Funding= The primary source of funding for artist-run centres is the Canada Council which has a specific program of two-year operating support for artist-run centres. Most centres also receive funding from the Provincial governments, most of which have an arts council to financially assist individual artists and arts organizations. Centres may also receive funding from their local municipal or city governments. Centres sometimes will secure funding for specific projects from corporations that manage lottery earnings or public and private foundations. Centres have tended not to pursue individual sponsors or patrons, neither corporations nor individuals, in part because they are in a critical relationship with the traditional and established art system of museums which have the resources to pursue that type of support. =Support for artists= Artist-run centres create opportunities for artists to present their work. Centres typically accept submissions openly and make selections by a peer jury process although some centres also use curators to select projects. Artist-run centres provide an alternative venue to the established art gallery system and also help the artist to install the work and will often facilitate the creation of a critical text published in conjunction with the exhibition. Centres will also promote the exhibition or presentation of new and experimental art works. Canadian artist-run centres are committed to the principle of paying artists for the exhibition or presentation of their work. Indeed, centres are required to do so if they receive funding from the Canada Council. A recommended minimum fee schedule for payment is provided by Canadian Artists Representation (CARFAC), a non- profit artists' advocacy group founded in 1968 that serves as the national voice of Canada's professional visual artists. CAR first suggested fee schedules to Canadian galleries in 1968; by 1971 they came more widely into use as a result of a threatened boycott of galleries by CAR members, and in 1988 the payment of an Exhibition Right for the public exhibition of artistic production became part of Canadian federal copyright law with an amendment to the Canadian Copyright Act (R.S., 1985, c. C-42) recognizing artists as the primary producers of culture and giving artists legal entitlement to exhibition and other fees. =Advocacy= Artist-run centres advocate an artist-centric approach, promoting artists self-determination of what to present and how to present it. This approach has widely influenced the contemporary art scene. The artist-run centres are collectively represented by associations formed by region or constituency, which associations are themselves represented by a national association. These associations advocate on behalf of their centre members on issues of public policy.

It is located about from Udupi City, near Shankarapura. The main attraction of the village is a hill, known as Durga Betta, on which stands a temple of Durga, known to locals in the Tulu language as Kunjar Amma. Parashurama is credited with erecting the temple in honour of the divine mother, Adi Shakti. It is said that when he created Kerala, he found in the depth of the sea a pearl, which he fashioned into a nose ring and decorated the idol of Kunjaru Amma with. According to legend, however, the sea always retrieves whatever is taken from it. To protect the idol for a long time, Parashurama installed the idol in the Kunjaru hill; but to this day, the sea keeps coming closer to the hill. The hill comprises nearly 250‚Äì300 stairs as a pathway leading to the beautiful Kunjarugiri temple. Thousands of school kids visit every year as a part of the school trips and spend memorable time in the midst of the spectacular sight. A lot of Foreigners also visit the beautiful place Udupi which stands proudly on the Konkan coast. During \\"Krishna Janmashtami\\"( the day lord Krishna was born), thousands of visitors are seen in the streets of Udupi. Sri Madhvacharya, the founder of the Dvaita school of philosophy, used to visit the Durga temple every day during his childhood. One day, when he was in the Kunjaru temple, his mother called from Pajaka, a kilometre or two away; Madhavacharya is believed to have jumped straight to his house. To this day, his footprints can be seen on a particular rock. The rock is found in a beautiful cave and the foot-prints are worshiped by the purohits of the temple. Around the hill, there are four ponds or 'thirthas' that were visited by Sri Madhva every day. The four ponds are called Dhanus Thirtha, Gada Thirtha, Bana Thirtha and Parashu Thirtha. Hindu mythology itself is beautiful with the great books like the mighty Mahabharatha or the astounding story of the great Ramayana or the holy script \\"The Bhagavad Gita\\" and places like Kunjaru definitely gives a heart-touching experiences of the great Indian history. Moreover, Udupi, is said to be created by Parashurama himself who was a Kshatriya Bhrahmin. Hence, people here likely call themselves as \\"Parashurama Shrishti\\".

It is a plant pathogen that infects maize and sorghum.  Hosts and Symptoms  Sporisorium reilianum causes the diseases maize head smut and sorghum head smut. This soil borne smut fungus has two formae speciales. S. reilianum f. sp. reilianum is specific to sorghum and S. reilianum f. sp. zeae is specific to maize. It is unknown why the two formae speciales cannot form spores on their respective non-favored hosts. Symptoms of the fungus are expressed on both the tassels of corn and sorghum as well as on the actual ear in the form of large smut galls. When the sorghum tassel is infected, the fragile gall membrane will have a range from just a few black spores to a large mass of black spores covering the tassel. The spores are a sign of the disease and are used for dispersal of the disease to other corn and sorghum plants. When the ear of the corn is infected, it looks very small and tear-drop shaped and seems as though it does not have a cob inside at all. The cob is replaced by white sori which are the structures that make and hold the spores of the fungus. If there is an infected tassel, it is likely that the ears will also have head smut.  Life cycle  Sporisorium reilianum is noted to have a sexual stage in its disease cycle similar to that of Ustilago maydis. AGRIOS, GN. PLANT DISEASES CAUSED BY FUNGI, In Plant Pathology (Fifth Edition), edited by GEORGE N. AGRIOS, Academic Press, San Diego, 2005, Pages 385-614, , Initial infections occur on roots of young seedlings. The pathogen develops systemically and is found on ear and tassel tissues as the host plant matures. At maturity teliospores can be found in the white sori of the infected heads of corn. These will be easily dispersed by the wind. Favorable nutritive soil and weather conditions around 23-30 ¬∞C allows for germination of the teliospores in the soil. Generation of a four-celled basidium occurs, leading to haploid basidiospores that create sporidia. These sporidia fuse due to a compatibility or likeness that induces the formation of dikaryotic mycelium, which is infectious and parasitic. This intracellular mycelium can be found invaded in parts of the flowering development of the corn, and S. reilianum can completely decrease floral tissue due to an ability to detect floral induction. S. reilianum is biotrophic in that it depends on the maize or sorghum for growth and survival. The inflorescence of the male or female parts of the plants, female being the ear and the male being the tassel can be affected by the timing of infection by this species. Necrosis and disease development is most prevalent on the head of the infected host.  Environment  Maize head smut occurs in most maize-growing areas, including many regions of North America, Australia, Asia, and southern Europe. It causes tremendous loss of yield during outbreaks due to the replacement of the ear with large smut sori. To infect maize roots, S. reilianum f. sp. zeae must form a dikaryotic parasitic hypha which results for the mating of two compatible haploid strains. The infection always occurs in soil via the root, unlike Ustilago maydis, another maize smut, which infects maize plants via aerial parts. Temperatures of 23-30 ¬∞C are optimal for field infection of corn, suspected to be due to maximum teliospore germination.  Management  Detection of S. reilianum is a key step toward the development of an effective disease management system. Conventional methods, including pathogen isolation and microscopic morphological study, are labor-intensive and cumbersome, and sometimes yield inconclusive results. Rapid, specific and sensitive molecular tools, such as PCR, are required for the detection and evaluation of S. reilianum. In 1999 there was developed a DNA-based assay for the detection of S. reilianum and its differentiation from Ustilago maydis. More recently, in 2012, a method using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry was established for identification of S. reilianum spores. Head smut can be controlled by use of resistant cultivars and seed treatment with fungicides. Foliar application of fungicides have not controlled the disease. Crop rotation is of questionable value because the smut spores can survive for long periods in the soil. It has been suggested that the most economical and environmentally friendly method to reduce maize yield losses is to breed and deploy resistant maize hybrids. In comparison with other cereal crops, such as rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), maize has fewer qualitative resistance genes that have been used extensively by breeders. Instead, maize has relatively more quantitative resistance loci deployed in the field to counter the majority of diseases. In other words, maize resistance to S. reilianum is thought to be under polygenic control. The cumulative effects of multiple smaller-effect quantitative resistance loci can produce high or even complete resistance.  Importance  The pathogenic tendency of Sporisorium reilianum as illustrated above is to carry out its life cycle in congruence with the growth of either maize or sorghum as the host plant. For example, In place of ears of corn; plant-like sorus develop. The onset of this smut is sporadic and slowly progressive however disease severity is high. For example, a field of corn can have 10% infected with yield loss that has an 80% apparent infection rate.Frederiksen RA., 1977 Head smuts of corn and sorghum. In: Loden HA, Wilkinson D, eds. Proceedings of the Annual Corn Sorghum Research Conference, 32nd. Washington DC: American Seed Trade Association. p 89‚Äì105 Post infection treatment to eliminate or reduce the disease are marginally effective or ineffective. The massive crop loss that this pathogen can create is devastating to producers who are unaware of the teliospores overwintering in the soil; which, can survive for many years. Treatment of seeds with a fungicide during planting or prior to harvest is important to limit the spread of spores especially if high risk field areas known by the producer. It is important to limit transmission of spores to disease free areas via harvesting equipment or planting tools. The incidence of Sporisorium reilianum occurs in occurs in Africa, Europe, U.S., and China. Fungicide use in the market today indicates that there are about 52 million acres of cereals lost worldwide a year.  Pathogenesis  Sporosorium relianium has shown the ability to sense the presence of nearby plants. This pathogen always infects via the roots, and hyphal proliferation near the roots is a characterization of the early stage of this Fungal pathogen. During the Basido-phase, basidiospores grow as haploid saprophytic yeasts. These yeasts join to form dikaryotic hyphae which in turn infect the host plant via the roots. It has been demonstrated on two varieties of maize that plant root exudates impact the growth and branching of S. relianium endomycorrhizal fungi prior to fungal contact with the root.

The first papers on the topic, by Kennedy and Russell C. Eberhart, were presented in 1995; since then tens of thousands of papers have been published on particle swarms. The Academic Press / Morgan Kaufmann book, Swarm Intelligence, by Kennedy and Eberhart with Yuhui Shi, was published in 2001. The particle swarm paradigm draws on social-psychological simulation research in which Kennedy had participated at the University of North Carolina, integrated with evolutionary computation methods that Eberhart had been working with in the 1990s. The result was a problem-solving or optimization algorithm based on the principles of human social interaction. Individuals begin the program with random guesses at the problem solution. As the program runs, the \\"particles\\" share their successes with their topological neighbors; each particle is both teacher and learner. Over time, the population converges reliably on optimal vectors. While there has been a trend in the research literature toward a \\"Gbest\\" or centralized particle network, Blackwell and Kennedy (2018) demonstrated the importance of a distributed population topology in solving more complex problems. A recent paper discusses the possible contribution of human female orgasm to the species' prosociality. Kennedy has been an active combatant in the controversy over sex education in Montgomery County, Maryland, supporting the public schools' efforts to develop a comprehensive and inclusive program. He also worked to support a gender identity nondiscrimination law in Montgomery County that came under attack from conservatives, and has maintained an online progressive presence. He also worked as a professional musician for fifty years and currently plays in a rockabilly band called The Colliders, which released albums in 2011 and 2015. In 2018 Kennedy released a DIY album, The Life of Mischief, and is currently organizing live performance of that material. Kennedy worked in survey methods for the US government, and has conducted basic and applied research into social effects on cognition and attitude. He served as Director of the Office of Analysis and Research Services at the US International Trade Commission until his retirement in 2017. He has worked with particle swarms since 1994, with research publications in fields related and unrelated to swarms and surveys.

He served as an advisor at the Croatian Mission to the European Union and NATO in Brussels from 1996 to 1999. During the same year he joined the Social Democratic Party. In 1998 he earned his master's degree in European Union law at the Flemish University in Brussels and was an assistant to the Foreign Minister of Croatia for political multilateral affairs in 2003. In June 2007 he was elected President of the SDP, following the death of the long-time party leader and former Prime Minister Ivica Raƒçan. Under Milanoviƒá's leadership the party finished in second place in the 2007 parliamentary election and was unable to form a governing majority. Despite losing the election, he was reelected party leader in 2008. In 2011 Milanoviƒá initiated the formation of the Kukuriku Coalition, uniting four centre to centre-left political parties. The coalition won an absolute majority in the 2011 parliamentary election, with the SDP itself becoming the largest party in Parliament. Milanoviƒá thus became Prime Minister on 23 December 2011, after the Parliament approved his cabinet. The beginning of his prime ministership was marked by efforts to finalise the ratification process of Croatia's entry into the European Union and by the holding of a membership referendum. His cabinet introduced changes to the tax code, passed a fiscalisation law and started several large infrastructure projects. After the increase in the value of the Swiss franc, the government announced that all Swiss franc loans would be converted into euros. Milanoviƒá supported the expansion of same-sex couples' rights and introduced the Life Partnership Act. After the inconclusive 2015 election and more than two months of negotiations on forming a government, he was ultimately succeeded as Prime Minister by the nonpartisan technocrat Tihomir Ore≈°koviƒá in January 2016. After Ore≈°koviƒá's government fell, Milanoviƒá led the four-party People's Coalition in the subsequent snap parliamentary election in September 2016. In the election, his coalition suffered a surprise defeat to the centre-right Croatian Democratic Union and Milanoviƒá announced his withdrawal from politics. He then entered the consulting business and worked as an advisor to Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama. On 17 June 2019, Milanoviƒá announced that he would be running for the office of President in the 2019‚Äì20 election as the candidate of the Social Democratic Party; he was officially nominated on 6 July 2019. He thereafter proceeded to receive the most votes (29.55%) in the first round of the election on 22 December 2019, ahead of incumbent President Kolinda Grabar- Kitaroviƒá (26.65%) and to be elected as the fifth President of Croatia in the runoff on 5 January 2020, with 52.66% of the vote. He became the first presidential candidate in Croatian history to receive more votes than an incumbent officeholder in the first round of an election, the second person in Croatia to defeat an incumbent running for reelection and the first (post- independence) Prime Minister of Croatia to be elected head of state. Personal life His father, Stipe Milanoviƒá (1938‚Äì2019), was an economist, and his mother, ƒêurƒëica \\"Gina\\" (n√©e Matasiƒá) Milanoviƒá, was a teacher of English and German. He stated that his family roots are from Livno, Bosnia and Herzegovina.http://ba.n1info.com/Vijesti/a402358/Milanovic-se-nasmijao-na- konstataciju-novinara-o-broju-glasova-iz-BiH.html His paternal family hails from the Sinj environs. His paternal grandfather and a paternal great-uncle, Ante and Ivan Milanoviƒá, respectively, from Glavice, reportedly joined the Partisans in 1942, taking part later in the liberation of Trieste, while his maternal grandfather, Stjepan Matasiƒá, from an affluent family, was, Milanoviƒá revealed in 2016, an Usta≈°a. Zoran's father was a member of the KPJ. Milanoviƒá was baptized secretly by his maternal grandmother, Marija Matasiƒá, at the Church of St. Peter and Paul, and given the baptismal name \\"Marijan\\". He was brought up in the neighborhoods of Kne≈æija, and after 1970 in Trnje, a communist quarter. He had a brother, Kre≈°imir, who died in 2019. Milanoviƒá attended the Center for Management and Judiciary from 1981.Javno ‚Äì Hrvatska , javno.com; accessed 15 April 2015. Milanoviƒá was into sports, football, basketball and boxing. He declared as a leftist. In 1985 he entered the University of Zagreb to study law, then finished his military service, and returned to study in 1986. Apart from Croatian, he speaks English, French and Russian. After college, Milanoviƒá became an intern at the Zagreb Commercial Court, and in 1993 for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, working under future political rival Ivo Sanader. A year later, he joined an OSCE peacekeeping mission in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, disputed between Azerbaijan and local Armenian rebels.Zoran Milanoviƒá profile , zivotopis.hr; accessed 15 April 2015. In 1994, he married Sanja Musiƒá, with whom he has two sons: Ante Jakov and Marko. Two years later, he became an advisor at Croatian mission to the European Union and NATO at Brussels, and two years later he got his master's degree in EU law from a Brussels university. Milanoviƒá returned to the Foreign Ministry in 1999, at the end of his mandate. Party president In 1999, he joined the Social Democratic Party (SDP) as he had not yet been an official member. Following SDP's win in the 2000 elections, he was given responsibility for liaison with NATO, three years later he became assistant to Foreign Minister Tonino Picula. He left his post after the 2003 elections when the conservative Croatian Democratic Union came to power. As an SDP member, in 2004 he renounced his position as an assistant minister of foreign affairs and became a member of the newly founded SDP's Executive Committee as well as the International Secretary in charge of contacts with other political parties. Two years later, he briefly became party spokesman, standing in for absent Gordana Grbiƒá. In early September 2006 he became SDP's coordinator for the 4th constituency in the 2007 elections. An extraordinary Party convention was held in Zagreb on 2 June 2007, due to 11 April resignation of the first Party President and Croatia's former Prime Minister Ivica Raƒçan. Milanoviƒá entered the contest, despite being considered an \\"outsider\\", because of his shorter term in the party, running against ≈Ωeljka Antunoviƒá (acting Party President since Raƒçan's resignation), Milan Bandiƒá and Tonino Picula. On 29 September 2007, during the campaign for party president, he publicly promised to resign and never to seek presidency of the party again, if party didn't win more seats that HDZ in next elections. In the first round he led with 592, well ahead of his nearest rival, ≈Ωeljka Antunoviƒá. He won the second round, thereby becoming president of the party. =2007 Parliament election= The 2007 parliamentary election turned out to be the closest election since independence with SDP winning 56 seats, only 10 mandates short of HDZ's 66. 5 seats that HDZ had won were from the eleventh district reserved for citizens living abroad, which was one of the main campaign issues of SDP which sought to decrease electoral significance of the so-called diaspora voters. The resulting close race left both sides in a position to form a government, provided they gather 77 of the 153 representatives. After the election, Sanader seemed to be in a better position to form a cabinet which caused Milanoviƒá to make himself the candidate for Prime Minister over the less popular Ljubo Jurƒçiƒá, without first consulting the party's Main Committee. However, the Social Democrats remained in the Opposition, since Ivo Sanader managed to form a majority coalition. After losing the hotly contested general elections, Milanoviƒá did not resign as party president, despite promising before the election that he would, should the party lose. In the 2007 election, despite the loss, SDP emerged with the largest parliamentary caucus in their history and achieved their best result yet. Milanoviƒá seemed to be in a good position to remain party president and announced he would run for a first full term as party president. In the 2008 leadership election he faced Davorko Vidoviƒá and Dragan Kovaƒçeviƒá, but emerged as the winner with almost 80 percent of the delegate vote. First term as Leader of the Opposition (2007‚Äì2011) Kukuriku coalition for the 2011 elections With 56 seats won SDP emerged from the 2007 election as the second largest party in Parliament and the largest party that is not a part of the governing majority. This made Milanoviƒá the unofficial Leader of the Opposition. Milanoviƒá was very critical of the Sanader administration, especially concerning their handling of the economy and the fight against corruption. In September 2008, Milanoviƒá made a highly publicized visit to Bleiburg to commemorate the repatriations.Milanoviƒá na Bleiburgu: \\"Ja sam tu zbog ≈ærtava, a ne zbog propalih re≈æima\\", Dnevnik.hr; accessed 15 April 2015. This made him the second leader of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia to visit the site, the first being Ivica Raƒçan. The 2009 local elections were held on 17 and 31 May and resulted with the Social Democrats making considerable gains in certain traditionally HDZ- leaning cities and constituencies, such as Dubrovnik, ≈†ibenik, Trogir and Vukovar, as well as retaining such major traditionally SDP-leaning cities as Zagreb and Rijeka. Milanoviƒá with Ivan Jakovƒçiƒá, Radimir ƒåaƒçiƒá and Silvano Hrelja announcing the formation of the Kukuriku coalition on 15 July 2011. On 1 July 2009, Ivo Sanader announced he was resigning the Premiership and leaving his deputy Jadranka Kosor as Prime Minister. Parliament approved her and the new Cabinet which made Kosor the first woman ever to be appointed Prime Minister. Since late 2008, the SDP had been leading the polls, however by a narrow margin. After the sudden resignation of Sanader HDZ plummeted in the polls to their lowest level since 1999 when corruption scandals were rocking the party establishment. Milanoviƒá insisted the resignation of the Prime Minister means that an early general election was necessary. The governing majority refused to dissolve Parliament and insisted that the Kosor cabinet would finish the remainder of its term. In 2008 the country's accession to the European Union was deadlocked with the Slovenian blockade over a border dispute. Sanader and his Slovenian counterpart Borut Pahor were unable to settle their differences in the following months which meant Croatian's accession to the European Union was in a standstill. There was much speculation, since Sanader hadn't given a reason for his departure, whether the Slovenian blockade was the cause for his resignation. In the following months Kosor and Pahor met several times, trying to resolve the border dispute. The negotiations resulted in an agreement which led to the continuation of negotiations for the Croatian accession to the European Union. The solution was an Arbitration Agreement which was signed in Stockholm on 4 November 2009, by both countries' Prime Ministers and the Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt. The agreement required a two-thirds majority in Parliament for it to be approved. Milanoviƒá and most SDP MPs voted in favor of the agreement, however he criticized the Government and especially its former and present leaders, Sanader and Kosor, for wasting precious time since the arrangement with Slovenia could have been made a year earlier and Croatia wouldn't have waited so long to continue with the accession process.\\"Sabor izglasao Sporazum o arbitra≈æi, SDP 'aktivno suzdr≈æan'\\", Dnevnik.hr; accessed 15 April 2015. The financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 hit most European countries hard, as well as Croatia. The crisis continued throughout the following years. Industry shed tens of thousands of jobs, and unemployment soared. Consumer spending reduced drastically compared to record 2007 levels, causing widespread problems in the trade as well as transport industries. The continuing declining standard resulted in a quick fall in both the Prime Minister's as well as government's support. Milanoviƒá was very critical of the Government's supposed slow response and inadequate measures that did little to revive the economy. The recession and high unemployment continued throughout 2011 resulting in many anti-government protests around the country.Rastrgali zastavu HDZ-a, zapalili SDP-ovu i EU-a , novilist.hr; accessed 15 April 2015. =2011 Parliament election= On 28 October MPs voted to dissolve Parliament. President of the Republic Ivo Josipoviƒá agreed to a dissolution of Sabor on Monday, 31 October and scheduled the election, as previously suspected, for Sunday, 4 December 2011. The 2011 parliamentary election saw SDP joining three other left-wing parties to create the media-dubbed Kukuriku coalition with Milanoviƒá at the helm. Kukuriku won the election with an absolute majority of 81 seats. The election was the first in which rival HDZ was not the leading individual party in Parliament.Sustainable Governance Indicators - 2015 Croatia Report, p. 2 Prime Minister (2011‚Äì2016) Zoran Milanoviƒá in the Croatian Parliament on 23 December 2011 Milanoviƒá's approval rating since becoming Prime Minister, conducted by Ipsos Puls Milanoviƒá presented his cabinet to the Parliament on 23 December, 19 days after the election. The discussion resulted with 89 members, 81 Kukuriku and 8 national minority MPs, voting in favour of the Milanoviƒá cabinet.\\"Pogledajte kako je izglasano povjerenje Vladi!\\", rtl.hr; accessed 15 April 2015. The transition to power occurred the following evening when Jadranka Kosor welcomed Milanoviƒá to the government's official meeting place, Banski dvori, opposite the Sabor building on St. Mark's Square and handed him the necessary papers and documents.\\"Kosor s velikim bro≈°em HDZ-a Milanoviƒáu predala vlast: Idemo probati biti uspje≈°ni\\", slobodnadalmacija.hr; accessed 15 April 2015. Taking office at the age of 45, Milanoviƒá became one of the youngest prime ministers since Croatia's independence. In addition, his cabinet also became the youngest, with an average minister's age of 48. Cabinet members came from three out of four parties of the winning coalition, leaving only the single-issue Croatian Party of Pensioners (HSU) without representation. Milanoviƒá was reelected as president of the SDP in the 2012 leadership election as the only candidate. =Domestic policy= The Milanoviƒá administration started its mandate by introducing several liberal reforms. During 2012 a Law on medically assisted fertilization was enacted, Health education was introduced in all elementary and high schools, and Milanoviƒá announced further expansion of rights for same-sex couples. During the 2011 elections the Kukuriku coalition promised to publish the registry of veterans of the Croatian War of Independence, which was done in December 2012. In the Trial of Gotovina et al, following an initial guilty verdict in April 2011, Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markaƒç were ultimately acquitted in November 2012. Milanoviƒá called the ruling \\"an important moment for Croatia\\", adding that \\"A huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I say thank you to them for surviving so long for the sake of Croatia.\\" In September 2013 anti-Cyrillic protests started against the introduction of bilingual signs with Serbian Cyrillic alphabet in Vukovar. Milanoviƒá condemned them as \\"chauvinist violence\\", saying he will not take down signs in Cyrillic in Vukovar as the \\"rule of law must prevail\\". On 1 December 2013, a constitutional referendum was held in Croatia, its third referendum since becoming independent. The referendum, organized by the citizen initiative For the family, proposed an amendment that would define marriage as a union between a man and a woman, thus creating a constitutional prohibition against same-sex marriage. Milanoviƒá opposed the proposal and told HRT that he would vote against it.Croatia to hold referendum on same-sex marriage ban BBC News, 8 November 2013 The government advised citizens to vote against it, but the referendum passed with 65% votes in favour, however, with voter turnout at only 38%. Milanoviƒá was unhappy that the referendum had taken place at all, saying, \\"I think it did not make us any better, smarter or prettier.\\" He also said that the referendum does not change the existing definition of marriage according to Croatian laws. He further announced the upcoming enactment of the Law on Partnership, which will enable same-sex persons to form a lifetime partnership union, which would share the same rights as that of marriage proper, apart from the right of adoption. On 12 December 2013 the Government passed the proposed Bill, and the Parliament passed the Life Partnership Act in July 2014.POVIJESNA ODLUKA U SABORU Istospolni ƒáe parovi od rujna imati ista prava kao i braƒçni partneri A bad economic situation weakened the originally strong public support for the Milanoviƒá government, which was demonstrated in the 2013 local elections.Sustainable Governance Indicators - 2015 Croatia Report, p. 4 In the first European Parliament elections in Croatia in 2013, SDP won 32% of the votes and five MEPs, one less than HDZ, the largest opposition party. The following year SDP won 29.9% in the 2014 European Parliament elections and four MEPs. Milanoviƒá and his party gave support to Ivo Josipoviƒá in the presidential elections, which were won by Kolinda Grabar-Kitaroviƒá from the HDZ. Josipoviƒá later formed his own party, Forward Croatia-Progressive Alliance, instead of returning to the SDP. Croatian war veterans started a protest in Zagreb in October 2014, calling for the resignation of Predrag Matiƒá, war veterans minister, and a new constitutional law guaranteeing their rights. Milanoviƒá rejected their demands, saying that there is no reason to sack the minister and that he would not submit to ultimatums: The protest continued throughout 2015. In May 2015 it escalated when hundreds of veterans scuffled with the police in front of the government building. Milanoviƒá said that his government has not curbed their rights and that he is ready for talks, but will not be blackmailed. He accused the opposition party HDZ for manipulating with the veterans. Tomislav Karamarko, the president of HDZ, rejected the accusation. Milanoviƒá met with the representatives of the protesting veterans in June, but the protest continued. On 4 August 2015, on the insistence of Milanoviƒá and the Defence Minister Ante Kotromanoviƒá, a military parade of the Croatian Armed Forces was held in Zagreb in honour of the Victory Day, celebrating the 20th anniversary of Operation Storm. Milanoviƒá thanked everyone who sacrificed their lives for Croatia's freedom. He also expressed his gratitude to Franjo Tuƒëman, first Croatian president, who led Croatia during the war. =Economy= Milanoviƒá government approval ratings, conducted by Ipsos Puls The Milanoviƒá administration adopted a number of reforms in taxation in order to cope with the difficult economic situation. It raised the standard Value-added tax from 23% to 25% and introduced new VAT rates for goods and services that were not previously taxed. It also cut social insurance contributions and public-sector wages.Sustainable Governance Indicators - 2014 Croatia Report, p. 7 In October the Financial Operations and Pre-Bankruptcy Settlements Act was passed, which allowed firms that were unable to pay their bills to stay open during the bankruptcy proceedings and restructure their debts. Because of opposition by its coalition partner, HNS, property tax has not been expanded.Sustainable Governance Indicators - 2015 Croatia Report, p. 8 The government succeeded in reducing the budget deficit to 5.3% in 2012, but GDP contracted by 2.2% and public debt reached 69.2%. Milanoviƒá's time in office has been marked by several cuts to Croatia's credit rating. On 14 December 2012 S&P; cut the country's long term rating to BB+ and the short term rating to B. On 1 February 2013, Moody's cut Croatia's credit rating from Baa3 to Ba1. Several major construction projects started in 2012, including a new passenger terminal on the Zagreb International Airport and a third block of the coal-fired Plomin Power Station. However, some projects have been suspended, including the Ombla hydroelectric power plant. The government said that construction of the Pelje≈°ac Bridge was to start in spring 2016. Milanoviƒá expressed his support for further oil and gas exploration and exploitation in the Adriatic Sea, which is opposed by the opposition parties and environmental organizations. In November 2012 Minister of Economy and Deputy Prime Minister Radimir ƒåaƒçiƒá resigned and was replaced by Ivan Vrdoljak. In 2013 a new fiscalization law was introduced to control gray economy and minimize tax avoidance. The government put focus on the shipbuilding industry and privatized state-owned shipyards by May 2013. In order to service public debt, the government presented a project of monetization of Croatian highways in 2013 which would bring around 2.5 billion euros. Trade unions and civic associations rejected the proposal and called for a retraction of the decision. A civic initiative called \\"We Are Not Giving Our Highways\\" gathered signatures for a highway referendum. Although the constitutional court ruled that a referendum on the subject was unconstitutional, the government announced that it was withdrawing the decision. Instead of the initial plan to lease the country's highways to foreign investors, the government will instead offer shares in them to Croatian citizens and pension funds. The Pension Insurance Act of January 2014 raised the statutory retirement age from 65 to 67 and early retirement age from 60 to 62.Sustainable Governance Indicators - 2015 Croatia Report, p. 13 The unemployment rate peaked in February 2014 at 22.7%, but has since been steadily declining and reached its lowest rate in two years in August. In May 2014 Milanoviƒá sacked the finance minister, Slavko Liniƒá, over a property deal that he said had hurt the state budget and appointed Boris Lalovac on his place. Changes in Personal Income Tax were introduced in 2015, the non-taxable part of income was raised, which resulted in a net salary increase for around one million people. In January 2015 the government decided to freeze exchange rates for Swiss francs for a year, after a rise in the franc that caused increasingly expensive loans for borrowers in that currency. In August 2015 Milanoviƒá announced that Swiss franc loans will be converted into euro- denominated ones. GDP decreased in 2013 (-0.9%) and 2014 (-0,4%), but in the 4th quarter of 2014 real GDP growth reached 0.3% for the first time since 2011. It was announced on 28 August 2015 that the economy had grown by 1.2% for a third consecutive quarter which marked Croatia's exit from a six-year economic recession. The budget deficit decreased in 2015 to 3.2% of GDP, down from 5.5% in 2014, and public debt was at 86.7% of GDP, the lowest debt growth rate since the introduction of the ESA 2010 methodology. =Foreign policy= Milanoviƒá and U.S. Army Gen. Martin Dempsey meet in Zagreb, 2014 Milanoviƒá at the Summit of Prime Ministers of the Central and Eastern Europe in Bucharest in 2013 Milanoviƒá's foreign policy was initially concentrated on the accession of Croatia to the European Union. On 22 January 2012, an EU accession referendum was held, with 66.25% voting in favour and 33.13% against. About 47% of eligible voters took part in the referendum. On 11 March 2013, Milanoviƒá signed the Memorandum of Agreement with Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jan≈°a, regarding the issue of Ljubljanska Banka, which closed down in 1991 without reimbursing its Croatian depositors. Croatia agreed to suspend a lawsuit against the bank and its successor, while Slovenia pledged to ratify Croatia's EU Accession Treaty. Slovenia ratified Croatia's accession bid on 2 April 2013. After all 27 member states signed the EU accession treaty, on 1 July 2013, Croatia joined the European Union, becoming the 28th member state. On 27 February 2012 Milanoviƒá visited Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was his first travel to a foreign country since he became prime minister. On the following day he visited ≈†iroki Brijeg and Mostar, where he met with members of the Croatian National Assembly, a political organisation of the Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Milanoviƒá said that all he is asking for Croats in that country is a fair deal and added that Croatia will support the Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union. Due to the ongoing civil war in Syria, in February 2012 Milanoviƒá called on Croatian companies working in Syria to withdraw from the country. On 18 January 2013 Croatian Foreign Ministry declared that Croatia, as well as the entire European Union, recognizes the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces as the only \\"legitimate representatives of the aspirations of the Syrian people\\". In February 2013 Milanoviƒá announced that Croatia is withdrawing its troops from the Golan Heights that are participating in the UN's peacekeeping mission after it was reported that Croatia sold their old weapons to the Syrian opposition. When demonstrations and riots started in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2014, Milanoviƒá visited Mostar, a city with a Croat majority, where the seat of HDZ BiH was damaged in the riots. Sarajevo criticized his move, saying he should have visited the capital first. Milanoviƒá later called the protest quasi-civic on ethnic and religious vertical. The Croatian Government refused to accept indictments from Sarajevo labeled as political due to unacceptable claims about the character of the Croat‚ÄìBosniak War. On 22 July 2015 a major scandal occurred during the arbitration procedure of the Croatian-Slovenian border dispute, when it was discovered that the Slovenian representative has been lobbying other judges to rule in Slovenia's favor. Three days later Milanoviƒá announced the withdrawal of Croatia from arbitration after a meeting with the leaders of parliamentary groups. =European migrant crisis= Beginning on 16 September 2015, migrants and refugees from the Middle East, South Asia and Africa began entering Croatia from Serbia in large numbers after the construction of the Hungary- Serbia barrier. On 17 September Croatia closed its border with Serbia. After initial efforts to register all migrant entrances into Croatia, registration ceased on 18 September and migrants began to be transported toward Slovenia and Hungary. By 23 September 2015 over 40.000 had entered Croatia from Serbia, with main acceptance centers set up in Opatovac and Zagreb, while migrants were also held in Beli Manastir, Ilaƒça, Tovarnik, Je≈æevo and Sisak. Milanoviƒá criticized Serbia for sending migrants only towards the Croatian border, while sparing Hungary and Romania and stated that his country \\"will not become a migrant hotspot\\". Tensions escalated between Serbia and Croatia and on 24 September Serbia banned imports from Croatia to protest against Croatia's decision to close the border to cargo, while Croatia responded by banning all Serbian-registered vehicles from entering the country. On 25 September Croatia lifted the blockade on its border and Serbia lifted its ban on imports from Croatia, but Milanoviƒá said that he is ready to block the border again if necessary. With winter approaching a new, more permanent refugee acceptance center was built in Slavonski Brod in late 2015. =2015 Parliament election= Milanoviƒá with other members of the Croatia is Growing coalition on 8 September 2015 For the 2015 parliamentary election the Kukuriku Coalition changed its name to Croatia is Growing. It consists of three out of four original members: the Social Democratic Party, Croatian People's Party ‚Äì Liberal Democrats (HNS-LD), Croatian Party of Pensioners (HSU), as well as three new ones: Croatian Labourists ‚Äì Labour Party, Authentic Croatian Peasant Party (A-HSS) and Zagorje Party. Istrian Democratic Assembly left the coalition. The campaign of the Coalition, led by Milanoviƒá, was based on rhetoric against austerity measures and emphasizing the government's policies during its mandate. After 76 days of negotiations, the Patriotic Coalition and the Bridge of Independent Lists party formed the 13th Croatian Government with Tihomir Ore≈°koviƒá as the new Prime Minister. Milanoviƒá formally handed over office to Ore≈°koviƒá in the late hours of 22 January 2016, after a lengthy parliamentary debate on the new government's program and the subsequent vote of confidence. Second term as Leader of the Opposition (2016) On 2 April 2016, elections were held for the party's leadership. Milanoviƒá's opposing candidate was Zlatko Komadina, the prefect of Primorje-Gorski Kotar County, who advocated for a \\"much more social democratic\\" SDP. Milanoviƒá was again re- elected president of SDP for the next four years. =2016 Parliament election= Milanoviƒá with other members of the People's Coalition in Zabok, where they signed a coalition agreement on 16 July 2016 In July 2016, SDP, HNS-LD and HSU formed the People's Coalition () for the 2016 parliamentary election. They were joined by the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), while the Croatian Labourists left the coalition. Leaked taped conversations from a meeting with representatives of veterans association, published on 24 and 25 August 2016 by Jutarnji list, in which Milanoviƒá made controversial statements against the neighboring countries of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, have caused criticism. While commenting on Serbia's accession to the EU and their law on universal jurisdiction for war crimes prosecution on the whole territory of former Yugoslavia, Milanoviƒá stated that the Serbian government was acting arrogantly, and that he was willing to not only block Serbia's EU accession negotiations, but also to adopt a special law which would allow Croatia to prosecute Serbian citizens who committed crimes in Kosovo, adding that \\"Serbs want to be rulers of the Balkans, but are actually a handful of misery\\". While commenting on Bosnia and Herzegovina, Milanoviƒá stated that he wasn't \\"thrilled with the situation there\\" and complained that \\"there was no one he could talk to in Sarajevo\\", adding that he would like for Bosnia and Herzegovina to enter the EU even without all the preconditions being met, since \\"it's a country without law and order\\". In addition, he stated that he did not care about Za dom spremni salute but urged veterans not to use it because it is harmful to Croatia. Milanoviƒá's rhetoric during the 2016 electoral campaign was described by some observers as populist. The HDZ won a majority of seats in the parliament and formed a governing majority with Most, with HDZ leader Andrej Plenkoviƒá becoming the new Prime Minister. Milanoviƒá announced that he would not run for another term as SDP president. On 26 November he was succeeded by Davor Bernardiƒá as the president of SDP. Break from politics After leaving politics, Milanoviƒá entered the consulting business and founded a consulting firm called EuroAlba Advisory. Since 2017, he was an advisor to Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, and president of the Diplomatic Council of the Dag Hammarskj√∂ld University College of International Relations and Diplomacy. 2019 presidential campaign On 17 June 2019, Milanoviƒá confirmed that he will be running in the country's upcoming presidential election as SDP's candidate, with the campaign slogan \\"A president with character\\". While announcing his candidacy, Milanoviƒá said that he wanted to be the \\"president of a modern, progressive, inquisitive and open Croatia\\". The SDP main committee, as well as the HSS presidency, gave support to Milanoviƒá's bid for president. He was subsequently endorsed by several centre-left and centrist parties, including the HSU, PGS, NS-R, Democrats, IDS, HL, SU, Glas, MDS, SNAGA, and ZS.https://emedjimurje.rtl.hr/vijesti/politika/3581809/mds-daje-podrsku- kandidaturi-zorana-milanovica-za-predsjednika-republike-hrvatske/ The first round of the election took place on 22 December 2019, with Milanoviƒá winning a plurality of 29.55% of the vote, ahead of Kolinda Grabar-Kitaroviƒá, who received 26.65% of the vote. Miroslav ≈†koro, who was running as an independent candidate, narrowly failed to reach the run-off election, managing to attract the support of 24.45% of voters. Therefore, this election marked the first time in Croatian history that the incumbent president did not receive the highest number of votes in the first round. Furthermore, Milanoviƒá attained both the lowest number of votes (562,779) and the lowest percentage of the vote of any winning candidate in the first round of a presidential election. Milanoviƒá received a plurality of the vote in Croatia's three largest cities: 33.02% in Zagreb, 30.79% in Split and 41.87% in Rijeka, and finished second (25.61%) in the fourth largest city, Osijek, which was won by ≈†koro (33.33%).https://www.izbori.hr/pre2019/rezultati/1/index.html A run-off election took place between Milanoviƒá and Grabar-Kitaroviƒá on 5 January 2020. Milanoviƒá won by a margin of close to 105,000 votes, thereby becoming the 5th President of Croatia since independence and the second president to have been officially nominated by the Social Democratic Party, after Ivo Josipoviƒá (2010‚Äì2015). Since his electoral victory, the newly elected president Zoran Milanoviƒá has made his first public appearance at an official event in Rijeka. There he attended the inaugural ceremony of Rijeka as the European Capital of Culture 2020. He met with the mayor Vojko Obersnel, commended the artists, the day-long programme and the opening ceremony. Milanoviƒá also praised the founders of punk rock in Rijeka and its 44-year-old tradition, stating that, \\"By the time when the Paraf were having their first concert, Sid Vicious hadn‚Äôt been singing in the Sex Pistols yet. These facts are of crucial importance regarding the cultural map of Europe\\". Presidency The inauguration of Zoran Milanoviƒá as the 5th President took place on 18 February 2020. This was the first time that a presidential inauguration ceremony in Croatia was not held at St. Mark's Square in the city center of Zagreb, where the parliament and government buildings are located. Instead, Milanoviƒá decided to forgo the usual pomp of the ceremony by inviting merely some 40 guests, including state officials, former presidents, his family and members of his campaign team. This was also the first time that party leaders, diplomats, and church dignitaries did not attend a presidential inauguration. The ceremony began with the performance of the national anthem by renowned Croatian pop and jazz diva Josipa Lisac, accompanied by pianist Zvjezdan Ru≈æiƒá, whose alternative rendition of Croatia's national anthemhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxgRBrx5R2E struck a different tone to the national anthem's usual sombre, bombastic delivery. \\"...While some find it deep, artistic and special, others see it as mockery as performance not worth of the National Anthem.\\" This caused a lot of positive comments and negative reactions \\"...While some find it deep, artistic and special, others see it as mockery as performance not worth of the National Anthem.\\" which resulted in an unprecedented public debate about the national anthem and artistic freedom. On 24 February 2020, President Milanoviƒá strongly condemned the burning of an effigy showing a same-sex couple with their child at a festival in Imotski, describing the incident as an ‚Äúinhumane, totally unacceptable act‚Äù, demanded an apology from the organizers of the event and stated that they \\"deserve the strongest condemnation of the public because hatred for others, intolerance and inhumanity are not and will not be a Croatian tradition\\". He also demanded a reaction from the relevant institutions especially as the event was observed by many children who could witness the spreading of hatred and inciting to violence. President Milanoviƒá made his first trip abroad as President on 27 February 2020 to Otoƒçec ob Krki, Slovenia, where he met with President Borut Pahor. The two of them firmly concluded that they will do everything to improve and make the relations between the two countries excellent, pointing out that they had known each other for over 16 years. They also discussed about the border issue between the two countries, Croatian accession to the Schengen Area and about the border controls implemented by the Croatian Government due to the COVID-19 pandemic. President Milanoviƒá also addressed the European perspective of Albania and North Macedonia.

Biography  Frost was born in Finchley, Middlesex, England.Francis A J, The Cement Industry 1796-1914, David & Charles, 1977, , pp61ff He set up a plant making Roman cement at Harwich in 1807, supplying it for government work. He began experimenting with formulations for \\"artificial\\" cements that would provide a cheaper alternative to Roman cement. He appears to have produced a prototype cement at Harwich in 1810. However, it was not until 1822 that he was granted a patent for what he called \\"British Cement\\". In October 1825, he leased land at Swanscombe, Kent, and set up a plant to manufacture both Roman cement and the new product. The key innovation in his work was the \\"wet\\" grinding of raw materials, which became fundamental to the early development of Portland cement. He ground the soft local chalk together with alluvial clay from the Medway estuary and added water in a washmill to produce a thin slurry from which coarse particles could be removed by settling. The fine, homogenous mixture of chalk and clay particles was dried to a stiff plastic consistency before being burned in a kiln. He thus emulated the natural process of sedimentary formation of a marl. Charles Pasley communicated frequently with Frost, and gave a detailed description of his techniquesPasley C W, Observations on Lime, Calcareous Cements etc, 1838, appendices 14-16 based on a visit to Swanscombe in December 1828. In 1832, he sold the Swanscombe plant to John Bazely White's, and migrated to New York City, where he set up as a civil engineer. He contributed several papers on calcareous cements to the Journal of the Franklin Institute. His Swanscombe plant became in the 1840s, under the management of I C Johnson, the second plant to make true Portland cement, and subsequently the \\"mother\\" plant of Blue Circle Industries. It closed in 1990, after 165 years of continuous operation.

In Islamic theology, two opposite terms are attributed to Allah, tashbih and tanzih, or distance and transcendence. However, the fuller meaning of tashbih is 'affirming similarity', i.e. affirming Allah's nearness to humanity. This concept is eternally juxtaposed with Allah's tanzih (transcendence, or 'declaring incompatibility'). The literal meaning of the word is \\"to declare something similar to something else\\". This definition affirms that Allah has some similarity to his creations: \\"Nothing is like Him.\\" (Sura 42:11) but His attributes require some similarity to the world, as people associate compassion, mercy and wrath with our interpretation of such adjectives. The two, opposing aspects affect every aspect of a Muslim's belief, action and relationship with Allah. Tashbih is associated with Allah's Right Hand (mercy) in contrast to tanzih being associated with his Left Hand (wrath). The Divine Names of Allah associated with tashbih are those that indicate nearness, closeness and mercy: Compassionate, Merciful, Desiring, Forgiver, Creator and Loving.

Adieu mes amours was a popular secular polyphonic chanson of the late 15th century. Many settings of this tune are in fact based on the c. 1480 setting by Josquin des Prez, in which the lower two voices are in quasi-canon, and the upper two voices are freer. The tune itself is in a simple ABA' form. It appeared in many manuscripts and prints from many countries, including in Ottaviano Petrucci's Odhecaton A.GrovePrinted Venice, 1501 Josquin's version Josquin's chanson was used as the basis for works by a number of other composers, including a version by Heinrich Isaac, and the five-voice chanson \\"Vous seulement\\" by Simon Moreau. The setting by Jean Mouton seems to be unrelated to the setting by Josquin. Although \\"Adieu mes amours\\" was originally a secular chanson, it was used in a number of mass settings such as, Missa \\"Adieu mes amours\\" which uses both parody and cantus firmus compositional techniques by Francesco de Layolle, and another Missa \\"Adieu mes amours\\" by Jacob Obrecht. The first attribution to Josquin of this chanson is in the Casanatense chansonnier of around 1480, which was probably put together to celebrate the betrothal of Isabella d'Este to Francesco Gonzaga. The chansonnier includes works by many of the great composers of the period, including Johannes Ockeghem, Johannes Martini and Alexander Agricola. It included six chansons attributed to Josquin, each with a different spelling of his name, suggesting that the copyist was not aware of Josquin prior to this, lessening the likelihood that the chanson was mistakenly attributed to Josquin. An issue in the performance practice of Josquin's setting of this chanson is whether it was a vocal piece or an instrumental piece. Although there is underlay of the text in the Florence 2794 manuscript,copied in the 1480s at the French royal court. the music does not fit well with the rondeau refrain of the original. At least ten other contemporary manuscripts include only the incipit and no other text.Sherr, pg. 356 References  Sherr, Richard, ed. The Josquin Companion. Oxford: Oxford Univ.

The local council was formed in 1995 through the consolidation of the villages of Barta'a West, Ein as-Sahala, and Muawiya; Basma is an acronym of the villages' names. In it had a population of . Basma's jurisdiction area covers 3,956 dunams. History Each of Basma's villages were under the administration of a Mukhtar (village headman), who was appointed by the Interior Ministry until 1992, when the Interior Ministry established the Nahal Iron regional council, including Basma's villages and five others. The locals objected to the administrative arrangement, claiming that the council was established without consulting the locals and their wishes were not considered. Some of the villages had already sought an independent municipal status but were rejected. Most of the agricultural land was not included in the council's jurisdiction area, all of the council members were Jewish and it was given a Hebrew name. Following an appeal to the High Court of Justice, the state promised to dismantle the council and establish a regular regional council, where each village had an elected local committee. The appeal was cancelled but the locals appealed again, demanding an independent status for each village. The Ministry of Interior declared that the local concerns had been considered, but were not consistent with the ministry's policy of not creating local councils for small villages in fear of spending public money, and the High Court of Justice rejected the appeal. Eventually, in order to allay local concerns, the Interior Ministry established an investigative committee to examine other options, and in 1996, decided to split the regional council into two local councils: Ma'ale Iron, and Basma. In 2003, Basma was included in a wide plan of the Interior Ministry to merge local and regional councils in the region of Hadera. According to the plan, Basma was to be united with Arara and Kfar Qara, while Mu'awiya will be moved to Ma'ale Iron. The plan was rejected by all councils. Education Basma has three elementary schools for each village and two middle schools and high schools in Barta'a and Mu'awiya. There are 23 kindergartens in the council: 10 in Barta'a, 8 in Mu'awiya and 5 in Ein a-Sahala.

He served as Archbishop of Havana from 1941 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1946 by Pope Pius XII. Biography He was born in Camag√ºey to Rosendo Arteaga Montejo and his wife Delia Betancourt Guerra. Baptized as Manuel Francisco del Corazon de Jesus on April 17, 1880 by Father Vigilio Arteaga, he was confirmed by Archbishop Jos√© Mar√≠a Mart√≠n de Herrera y de la Iglesia on November 17, 1882. His paternal uncle, a priest by the name of Ricardo Arteaga Montejo, took Manuel to Venezuela in 1892, the former having previously left Cuba for that county for political reasons. Arteaga obtained his bachelor's in philosophy on June 15, 1898 from Universidad Central de Venezuela, and entered a Capuchin convent in Caracas in 1900. However, for reasons of health, he left the convent and entered the Seminary of Santa Rosa de Lima in Caracas on April 12, 1901. Receiving the subdiaconate and diaconate in 1902, Arteaga was eventually ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Juan Bautista Castro on April 17, 1904. He did pastoral work in Cuman√° from 1906 to 1912, and then in Camag√ºey until 1915. Before becoming Canon Schoolmaster in 1916, Arteaga was named provisor and vicar general of the Archdiocese of Havana 1915. He was raised to the rank of Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on May 31, 1926, and Vicar Capitular of Havana on January 3, 1940. On December 28, 1941, Arteaga was appointed Archbishop of Havana and thus Primate of the Church in Cuba by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on February 24, 1942 from Archbishop Giorgio Caruana, with Archbishop Manuel Zubizarreta y Unamunsaga, OCD, and Bishop Eduardo Mart√≠nez y Dalmau, CP, serving as co-consecrators, in the Cathedral of Havana. Pope Pius XII created him Cardinal Priest of San Lorenzo in Lucina in the consistory of February 18, 1946, and thus the first Cuban member of the College of Cardinals. Arteaga suffered a wound to his forehead in August 1953, reported by the censored press to be from a fall in his archiepiscopal residence, and required twenty stitches.TIME Magazine. The Cardinal's Forehead September 7, 1953 The Cardinal, in a pastoral letter that September, later explained that his injury was \\"a common criminal attempt\\" by a group of strangers, putting to rest the suspicions that he had been pistol- whipped by governmental agents who were searching his residence for hidden revolutionaries or weapons.TIME Magazine. Rest & Recuperation September 21, 1953 His gravesite taken in August 2007 He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1958 papal conclave, which selected Pope John XXIII. Persecuted by the Communist regime of Fidel Castro, the Primate took refuge in the Argentine embassy and the Cuban nunciature from 1961 to 1962, when he was hospitalized at San Juan de Dios Hospital in Havana. Arteaga died at the same hospital a year later, at age 83. He is buried in the Colon Cemetery.

According to Islamic theology, human beings are born with an innate inclination of tawhid (Oneness), which is encapsulated in the fitra along with compassion, intelligence, ihsan and all other attributes that embody the concept of humanity. It is for this reason that some Muslims prefer to refer to those who embrace Islam as reverts rather than converts, as it is believed they are returning to a perceived pure state.Tuba Boz, Religious Conversion, Models and Paradigms, Epiphany: Journal of Transdisciplinary Studies, 2011, pp. 130 It has also been suggestedAbu al-Fazl Izzati, Islam and Natural Law, Islamic College for Advanced Studies Press, 2002, p. 96. that the religious meaning can be translated into the logical equivalence in philosophy, as Kant's concept of 'ought'.John Silber, Kant's Ethics: The Good, Freedom, and the Will, Mouton de Gruyter, 2012, pp. 188ff.

The only reference to Fitra in the Quran is on page 1821 but the reference of the concept of Primordial Nature is mentioned 14 other times. See page 3181. In a Hadith, the Islamic prophet Muhammad states that children are born upon Fitra and are then socialized into various religions. The Hadith states Muhammed as saying: ‚ÄúNo one is born except according to intrinsic nature, but their parents make them Jews, or Christians, or Magaians, just as a cow gives birth to a calf that is whole do you find it mutilated?'\\"Cleary, Thomas, translator.

It is therefore an organic peroxide, and can be viewed as a dimer of formaldehyde (COH). In the 1960s, biochemists discovered that some derivatives of 1,2-dioxetane have a fleeting existence as intermediates in the reactions responsible for the bioluminescence in fireflies, glow-worms and other luminescent creatures. The hypothesis could not be proved because these four-membered cyclic peroxides are quite unstable. Then in 1968 the first example of a stable dioxetane derivative was made at the University of Alberta in Edmonton: 3,3,4-trimethyl-1,2-dioxetane, prepared as a yellow solution in benzene. When heated to 333 K, it decomposed smoothly (rather than explosively, as many peroxides do) to acetone and acetaldehyde with the emission of pale blue light.Luminescence in the thermal decomposition of 3,3,4-trimethyl-1,2-dioxetane, Canadian Journal of Chemistry, Volume 47, p 709 (1969), K.R.Kopecky and C. Mumford The second example of a dioxetane derivative was made shortly after: the symmetrical compound 3,3,4,4-tetramethyl-1,2-dioxetane, obtained as pale yellow crystals that sublimed even when kept in the refrigerator. Benzene solutions of this compound also decomposed smoothly with the emission of blue light. By adding compounds that normally fluoresce in UV light the colour of the emitted light could be altered.Preparation and Thermolysis of Some 1,2-Dioxetanes, Canadian Journal of Chemistry, 1975, 53(8): 1103-1122, Karl R.

The luminescence of glowsticks and luminescent bangles and necklaces involves 1,2-dioxetanedione (CO), another dioxetane derivative that decomposes to carbon dioxide. Other dioxetane derivatives are used in clinical analysis, where their light emission (which can be measured even at very low levels) allows chemists to detect very low concentrations of body fluid constituents.US Patent No. 5,330,900 to Tropix Inc.

The massacre is considered one of the most notorious and devastating atrocities committed by the LTTE during the history of the Sri Lankan Civil War, and continues to be commemorated 20 years on. The massacre The Aranthalawa Massacre took place on June 2, 1987, when a bus carrying Buddhist monks and a few unarmed civilians was ambushed by 20 armed LTTE cadres near the village of Nuwaragalatenna, led by an LTTE leader named Reagan. They then ordered the driver of the bus, which was carrying the monks on a pilgrimage from their temple in Mahavapi to the Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara, to drive into the nearby Aranthalawa jungle. After the bus stopped, the LTTE cadres went on a rampage, attacking the monks with guns and swords and also shooting some of them with machine guns. Among the dead were 30 young novice monks and their mentor, the Chief Priest of the Vidyananda Maha Pirivena, Hegoda Sri Indrasara Thera. Four civilians who were traveling in the bus were also among the dead. Three monks who escaped the massacre sustaining critical injuries continue to require medical assistance. Another monk was permanently disabled. Motives This and similar attacks against Sinhalese civilians were carried out by the LTTE to antagonize the Sinhalese majority against the Tamil populace of the country, thereby creating rivalry between the two main ethnic groups of Sri Lanka. The LTTE hoped such animosity between the two races would result in attacks by Sinhalese against Tamil civilians, which would increase support and funding towards their violent campaign. Reaction Theravada monks are incapable of defending themselves. The harming of monk is considered to be one of the highest offenses in Theravada Buddhism or even among Hindu. The massacre is considered to be one of the most brutal attacks carried out during the conflict in Sri Lanka. Reagan's family was later killed by the army. Each year Aranthalawa Massacre is commemorated by a series of special programs. In 2007, to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the massacre, commemorations were held over the course of four days in Colombo and Ampara, with the main ceremony led by Sri Lanka President Mahinda Rajapaksa taking place in Colombo with the participation of the Mahanayake Theras of all Chapters. An all night Pirith ceremony was held on the same night, and a Sanghika DƒÅna was offered to 200 Buddhist monks on June 3. An exhibition of over 300 photographs of LTTE attacks on Buddhist sites and other acts of destruction was also organized. A plaque has since been constructed close to the site of the incident to commemorate the massacre. Retaliation One of the Tigers who committed the massacre was a local leader called Reagan from Vellaveli. In retaliation the Special Task Force unit of the Sri Lankan security forces ordered Reagan's family members to stand before them in their Vellaveli homes, and after reading their names from a list, shot them to death and dismembered their bodies. Similar attacks Throughout the course of the conflict in Sri Lanka, the LTTE has carried out a number of similar attacks against Buddhist sites. These include: *an attack on the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, killing around 146 pilgrims. *the assassination of the high priest of the famous Dimbulagala Forest monastery, Kithalagama Seelalankara Nayaka Thera, who gave moral support to people living in border villages to fight LTTE intrusions into their villages, eight years after the Aranthalawa Massacre. *a suicide bombing of the Temple of the Tooth, the sacred Buddhist shrine where the Buddha‚Äôs tooth relic is enshrined, which killed 17 worshipers and seriously damaged the temple. *a suicide bombing of a Buddhist temple in Batticaloa during celebrations of the Vesak holiday, killing 23 people including many children.

He is a right-handed batsman and a slow left-arm bowler who currently plays for Lancashire. Parry made his senior debut for Lancashire in 2007 and in 2009 was named Lancashire's Young Player of the Year. From 2008 to 2012 Lancashire had two other left-arm orthodox spinners in their squad, with Parry competing with them for places in the team. Parry became established in Lancashire's limited overs teams, though played less frequently for the first-class side. Having previously represented England Lions, Parry made his One Day International debut against the West Indies in March 2014, and played his first Twenty20 International against the same opponents later that month. Domestic career Parry made two appearances in the 2005 Minor Counties Championship season, as well as appearing in the MCCA Trophy for Cumberland, and was both his league's Player of the Season and Bowler of the Season in helping his club Northern to their ECB Premier League championship success of that year. In the second innings of Parry's debut first-class match, against Durham UCCE in April 2007, he picked up five wickets, including that of former Derbyshire squad-member Christopher Paget, though he did not contribute with the bat. At the end of the 2009 season, Parry was named Lancashire's Young Player of the Year. In April 2010, immediately before the start of the English cricket season, Lancashire's experienced and established spinner, Gary Keedy, suffered a broken collar bone. With several months on the sidelines, Keedy's absence gave the opportunity to young spinners Parry and Simon Kerrigan to play first-team cricket. Lancashire coach Peter Moores said \\"We're lucky in some ways in that we've got Stephen Parry, who played quite a lot of first-team cricket last season, but we've also got Simon Kerrigan, who bowled beautifully to take six wickets in the pre-season game against Yorkshire in Barbados and we could also use Steven Crofty's off-spin\\". Kerrigan was chosen ahead of Parry in the four- day team and cemented his place in the side. However, following a string of impressive twenty20 performances for Lancashire Lightning during the 2010 season, Parry was called up to the England Lions squad for their triangular series with India A and West Indies A. At the time of his selection, he was Lancashire's leading wicket-taker in the 2010 Friends Provident t20, and he finished as the competition's fourth-highest wicket-taker in 2010. He made his debut for the Lions on 8 July in their victory over India A; Parry took three wickets in the match. Parry bowling in a twenty20 match against Durham in 2012 As in the previous year, Parry was unable to break into Lancashire's team in the 2011 County Championship, but was a regular in the list A and twenty20 sides, playing 12 and 17 matches in the respective formats. His 13 list A wickets cost on average 32.30 runs each, while his 17 twenty20 wickets came at 24.94 runs apiece. Speaking in 2011, Gary Keedy explained that he is concerned that spin bowlers who learn how to bowl in the one-day format before playing first-class cricket will not become as effective bowlers as those who transition the other way round. He remarked that Parry \\"is a very fine one-day bowler but I think he takes more pride in bowling a maiden than he does bowling somebody out.\\" Parry spent that December with the England Performance Programme Squad, and coach Peter Moores noted \\"when he worked with the England Performance Programme Squad ... they measured the amount of spin he was getting on the ball and it was as high as almost anybody they had worked with.\\" While Parry was a regular feature in Lancashire's limited overs teams in 2012, Keedy and Kerrigan again shared spin bowling duties for the first- class side. In the hope of getting more exposure at first-class level, Parry considered moving to another club though eventually decided to remain at Lancashire. At the end of the 2012 season Keedy left to join Surrey to give Lancashire's younger spinners more opportunities. During the YB40 in May Parry recorded figures of 5 wickets for 17 runs, the second-best return for a Lancashire spinner in List A cricket (second only to David Hughes' 6 for 29 in 1977). The 2013 season saw Parry play three first-class matches for Lancashire, his first since 2009. International career In February 2014, Parry was named in England's squad for the limited-overs series in West Indies and the ICC World Twenty20 in Bangladesh. On his debut he took 3 for 32 and was man of the match, in England's win in the second ODI against West Indies. He followed this up with figures of 1-60, as England won by 25 runs. He played in the second T20 match between the two sides, taking figures of 0-17 in two overs as the West Indies won by five wickets. In the next match he took figures of 0-32 from his four overs. Parry was part of the England squad for the 2014 T20 World Cup. He only played in one game, against the Netherlands, which England lost by 45 runs. He bowled two overs and finished with figures of 0-23, and was ran out for one when batting. In November 2015, Parry was named in the England squad for the T20 series against Pakistan in the UAE. He played in the first 2 matches of the series, taking 2 for 33 in the first match and 1 for 33 in the second match.

This school is the music division of the Amsterdam University of the Arts, the city's vocational university of arts. The Conservatorium van Amsterdam is the largest music academy in the Netherlands, offering programs in classical music, jazz, pop, early music, music education, and opera. History The oldest predecessor of the Conservatorium van Amsterdam was founded in 1884 as the Amsterdamsch Conservatorium, four years before the completion of the Concertgebouw. In 1920 a competing music academy was established in Amsterdam by a society called 'Muzieklyceum'. The Bachzaal, used by the Amsterdamsch Conservatorium, was completed in 1931. In 1976, the Amsterdamsch Conservatorium, Conservatory of the Muzieklyceum Society, and the Haarlems Muzieklyceum merged to form the Sweelinck Conservatorium. This \\"new\\" academy of music moved to the former savings bank building in the Van Baerlestraat in 1985. In 1994 the Sweelinck Conservatorium merged with Hilversums Conservatorium to form the Conservatorium van Amsterdam. From 1998 its training programmes took place in their facilities in Van Baerlestraat and the Nieuwe Vaart. In 2008 the school moved to Oosterdokseiland. Building Since April 21, 2008, the Conservatorium van Amsterdam has its home in a new building at the Oosterdokseiland, near Amsterdam Central Station. The new building is centrally located in a cultural area, including the 'Muziekgebouw' with three concert halls for classical music and jazz, and the public library. Other faculties of the Amsterdam University of the Arts (Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten in Dutch) are within walking distance. This new complex is designed and equipped to current standards. Students can organize solo or ensemble concerts, create interesting projects with other music students or students from other art disciplines. They also make their own posters and flyers, sell tickets, or record their concerts in one of the concert halls and broadcast them on the internet radio at the CvA website. The design, by Dutch architect Frits van Dongen, is based on the 'Engawa model', the Japanese way of building, where the corridors are situated next to the outer walls of the building and the concert halls, classrooms and study rooms, within. Large windows in the front transmits sufficient daylight into the rooms. This building method is intended to enable students to study without being disturbed, while corridors keep noises out. The new building contains three units. At ground level there are four halls: * Bernard Haitinkzaal, a large hall with 450 seats * Amsterdam Blue Note, a hall for jazz and pop concerts, which seats 200 * Sweelinckzaal, a recital hall with 120 seats * Theaterzaal, which seats 50 The Bernard Haitinkzaal and Sweelinckzaal have windows which transmit daylight, which is exceptional for a concert hall. All halls have recording equipment, so that each concert or playing exam can be recorded. There is also a foyer and a canteen at ground level. At the next level there are four floors with lesson and classrooms and on top of these there are two floors with the library, a lecture hall and study rooms. Acoustic planning was by Akoestisch bureau Peutz, who researched the acoustic requirements of the lesson and study rooms and concert halls.

Hosts and symptoms A view of an infected pepper Colletotrichum capsici has a broad host range, but prefers peppers, yams and eggplants. On chili peppers, Capsicum annuum L., C. capsici infect the stem, fruit, and leaves of the plant, causing anthracnose, die-back and ripe fruit rot. C. capsici infection tends to infect ripe red fruit, and lead to the development of brown necrotic lesions containing concentric acervuli that will eventually appear black from the setae and sclerotia (Srinivasan, Vijayalakshmi Kothandaraman, Vaikuntavasan, & Rethinasamy, 2014). Additionally, the fruit content of capsaicin and oleoresin is reduced, which results in a decrease of its medicinal potency (Madhavan, Paranidharan, & Velazhahan, 2016). Disease cycle Dispersal of C. capsici spores is heavily reliant on water splashes onto host plants or wind-driven rain since water is required for spore germination and penetration into host (‚ÄúHot Pepper Disease - Anthracnose,‚Äù 2010). C. capsici has a necrotrophic lifestyle; therefore, after penetration of the host surface, it secretes many cell wall degrading enzymes into the environment between the host cells (Latunde-Dada, 2001). C. capsici overwinters as conidia or sclerotia, and spend the majority of their life in their conidial stage. Colletotrichum capsici, the asexual stage, consists of hooked shaped conidia produced from acervuli, a subepidermal fruiting body (Than et al., 2008). When grown on plates its colony morphology was observed to have white to grey, a dark green center, and dense, filamentous mycelium (Than et al., 2008). Management =Limit water exposure= Since C. capsici need water for their spores to germinate, limiting water can hinder C. capsici infection. By reducing or don‚Äôt use overhead irrigation and mulching, you can reduce water exposure in general and back splash on the fruit. =Crop rotation= Since other solanaceous species can act as alternative hosts, rotation with non- solanaceous crops is recommended (‚ÄúHot Pepper Disease - Anthracnose,‚Äù 2010). =Hot water seed treatment= By exposing pepper seeds to 52ÀöC water for 30 minutes, shock with cold water, drying the seed, and adding a fungicide like thiram, the infection of C. capsici can be greatly decreased(‚ÄúHot Pepper Disease - Anthracnose,‚Äù 2010). =Inoculum control via seed inspection= Since the primary inoculum for C. capsici are seeds both internally and externally infected, it is important to inspect the seed and dispose of infected seed (Chandra Nayaka, S., Udaya Shankar, A. C., Niranjana, S. R., Prakash, H. S., & Mortensen, 2009). Recently, PCR has become a popular tool to indicate the presence of C. capsici in and on chilli pepper seeds due to its precision, speed, and a background in pathogen taxonomy for the individual conducting the PCR is not necessary considered to traditional blotter and pathogenicity tests (Srinivasan et al., 2014). =Host resistance= Chili pepper breeding programs in Taiwan, Korea, and Thailand have been known to collaborate in order to generate chili species with high C. capsici resistance (Mahasuk, Khumpeng, Wasee, Taylor, & Mongkolporn, 2009).Two well used resistant species are a local Korean variety of C. annuum known as Daepoong- cho and C. chinense, which are crossable species (Kim, Yoon, Do, & Park, 2007; Mahasuk et al., 2009). Additionally, the species C. baccatum is identified as C. capsici resistant (Mahasuk et al., 2009). References *Chandra Nayaka, S., Udaya Shankar, A. C., Niranjana, S. R., Prakash, H.

Fungi survive on crop debris and disease emergence is favored by warm temperatures and wet weather. Hosts and symptoms Colletotrichum coccodes can infect potato, onion, tomato and has a large host range. The disease also infects hosts from the Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae and Solanaceae families). Colletotrichum coccodes can cause lesions, twisted leaves, and a bleached color on onion. On tomato, can see that there are sunken in dark spots. As the disease continues to develop can begin to see spots that are rotting. The pathogen can infect both green and ripe fruit; spots are not evident on green right away, but over time they develop. (Dillard, 1987). Symptoms are most common on the fruit, but they may also appear on the stem, leaves, and roots. In potato, C. coccodes is characterized by silvery lesions on the tuber surface which result in a deterioration in skin quality. In addition to causing tuber blemish symptoms, C. coccodes also causes symptoms on stems and foliage, which result in crop losses, and is implicated as a factor in the potato early dying disease complex. In the past the pathogen was not regarded as an issue, but it has become more prevalent. Disease cycle Colletotrichum coccodes can survive the winter as hard, melatinized structures called sclerotia. The pathogen may also survive in debris as threadlike strands called hyphae. In late spring the lower leaves and fruit may become infected by germinating sclerotia and spores in the soil debris. Infections of the lower leaves of tomato plants are important sources of spores for secondary infections throughout the growing season. Senescent leaves with early blight infections and leaves with flea beetle injury are especially important spore sources because the fungus can colonize and produce new spores in these wounded areas. The growth of C. coccodes is most rapid at 80 ¬∞F, although the fungus can cause infections over a wide range of temperatures between 55¬∞‚Äì95 ¬∞F. Wet weather promotes disease development, and splashing water in the form of rain or irrigation favors the spread of the disease (Dillard, 1987). The pathogen also produces an acervulus which is full of conidia that help to spread the infection (Hughes, 2009). Management Plant crops on well drained soils, use 3- 4- year crop rotations with plants which are not hosts, and resistant plants. Sanitation can also be important to reduce the spread of inoculum and clean seed should be planted. Soil fumigants may also be used although they may not be as economic as the other methods of control (Dilliard, 1987). Irrigation is to be avoided when fruit begins to ripen to avoid the splashing of spores, it is also recommended to rotate with a nonsolanaceous crop every other year (Davis et al., 2016).

It is considered a hemibiotrophic pathogen because it spends part of its infection cycle as a biotroph, living off of the host but not harming it, and the other part as a necrotroph, killing and obtaining nutrients from the host tissues. History The anthracnose of common bean was first identified in 1875 in the fruit and vegetable garden of the Agricultural Institute of Popplesdorf, Germany by Lindemuth.Leach, Julian Gilbert. 1922.The parasitism of colletotrichum lindemuthianum. University of Minnesota. Retrieved 30 March 2014 By 1878, Saccardo and Magnus had made many observations on the cause of the anthracnose disease, recording their results in Michelia I:129.Stoneman, Bertha. 1898. A comparative study of the development of some anthracnoses. Botanical Gazette 26 (2) (August, 1898). They concluded that it was caused by a fungus, which they named Gloeosporium lindemuthianum after Lindemuth himself. Several years later, Briosi and Cavara discovered the presence of setae on the fungus, reclassifying it from the genus Gloeosporium to Colletotrichum, where it remains today. Recognizing the devastating effect the fungus was having on common bean populations worldwide, it quickly became a heavily studied subject among scientists, who principally investigated means of controlling its spread. In 1911, Barrus reported the discovery of multiple fungal strains, each of which differed in its ability to infect certain varieties of bean plants, which initiated the work of Edgerton and Moreland, who found eleven different strains of the pathogen, but theorized more may exist. Since then, numerous strains have been identified, each targeting specific varieties of bean plants. During the early part of the 20th century, the various races were identified by use of the Greek alphabet, paired with numbers, but at the turn of the 21st century a naming system using binary code was adopted. Under the binary naming system, each plant cultivar is given a binary number, and the code for a particular race of the pathogen is determined by the sum of the binary numbers of the cultivars which it infects Life cycle =Infection= An illustration of the biotrophic primary hyphae post- inoculation.The spores of C. lindemuthianum are dispersed by rain splash and must quickly attach to the aerial parts of the plant in order to infect the host. A heavy rainfall may spread the spores as far as 4.5 meters from the host plant. The spore will then germinate on the new host and form a short germ tube which develops an appressorium, or 'pressing' organ. As the germ tube grows, it pulls the spore and the appressorium together, causing an indentation to occur in the cell wall. An infection peg is then able to protrude from the appressorium and penetrate through the cell wall. Once through the cell wall, an infection hypha grows and develops into an infection vesicle.Dean, Ralph; VanKan, Jan A. L.; Pretorius, Zacharias A.; Hammond- Kosack, Kim E.; Di Pietro, Antonio; Spanu, Pietro De.; Rudd, Jason J.; Dickman, Marty; Kahmann, Regine; Ellis, Jeff; Foster, Gary D. (2012). The Top 10 fungal pathogens in molecular plant pathology. Molecular Plant Pathology. p. 414. Accessed 31 March 2014. =Biotrophic phase= The first stage after infection is known as the biotrophic phase, and consists of a broad primary hyphae, which develops out of the infection vesicle. The primary hyphae occasionally penetrates through additional cell walls by use of mechanical force, but usually will not grow very far from the infection vesicle. It always stays along a wall, such that half of the hyphae's circumference is in contact with the cell wall at all times. The primary hyphae do not penetrate the host cell's plasma membranes, but instead grows between it and the cell wall. As such, these hyphae do not intentionally kill any cells.Munch, Steffen, Ulrike Lingner, Daniela S. Floss, Nancy Ludwig, Norbert Sauer, and Holger B. Deising. 2008. The hemibiotrophic lifestyle of colletotrichum species. Elsevier(165): 41. In these early stages of infection, proteins are released by the infection vesicle which suppress the host's defense responses. One such protein is formed by the nitrogen starvation-induced gene CgDN3. The proteins suppress any hypersensitivity responses from the host to allow unhindered growth and development of the fungus. During the biotrophic phase, the pathogen gains nutrients by transferring hexoses and amino acids from the living host cell to the fungus by use of monosaccharide-H+ symporters. =Necrotrophic phase= About 48‚Äì72 hours after inoculation, depending on the environment, the biotrophic phase ends and the necrotrophic phase begins. It is marked by the development of many thin hyphae, known as secondary or necrotrophic hyphae, which develop off of the primary hyphae and the infection hypha. Unlike the much larger primary hyphae, these secondary hyphae move freely through the host in all directions, penetrating cell walls and membranes alike. In order to more easily ramify throughout the host tissue, the hyphae release enzymes which break down host-specific proteins. Some such enzymes include cutinase, proteases, pectin and pectate lyases. One enzyme, endopolygalacturonase, is a highly specialized cell wall-degrading enzyme which is critical for the growth of the mycelium. Endopolygalacturonase is normally produced by fruiting plants and induces ripening of fruit by degrading polygalacturonan present in the cell walls. C. lindemuthianum releases large amounts of this enzyme, which not only weakens the cell wall by removing the polygalacturonan, ng the area available for cell-wall degradation by other enzymes.Acosta-rodr√≠guez, Ismael, Carlos Pi√±√≥n-escobedo, Ma Guadalupe Zavala-p√°ramo, Everardo L√≥pez-romero, and Horacio Cano-camacho. 2005. Degradation of cellulose by the bean-pathogenic fungus colletotrichum lindemuthianum. production of extracellular cellulolytic enzymes by cellulose induction. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 87, (4) (05): 301-10 All of this cell degradation is not allowed to go to waste, however, as the breaking down of the cell wall releases many oligo and monosaccharides which are then free to be taken up by the fungus. This is a much broader availability of sugars than was available in the biotrophic phase, which consisted mostly of glucose and fructose derived from sucrose. Because of how rapidly the fungus is killing the host, it no longer releases any defense response prevention proteins, relying purely on the rapid death of the host and growth of the pathogen. Additionally, since the mycelium must rapidly spread during the necrotrophic stage in order to supply nutrients to the fungus, it will more easily thrive in younger bean plants, which have softer tissues than their older counterparts. While there is very little discoloration of the host cells before secondary hyphae development, discoloration becomes rapidly apparent about 100 hours post infection. Black spots begin to develop on the surface of the plant, and grows radially outward: the manifestation of anthracnose disease. These are the first visual symptoms of an infected plant, and usually occur along leaf veins on the underside of the leaf. As the lesions grow, they become indented in the center, where conidia begin to develop. These conidia are colorless at first, but develop into light pink, flesh-colored pustules ready to be spread to new hosts by rain. In the event of infection of a bean pod, the conidia may develop in the seeds themselves, where they can remain dormant until the seed begins to germinate and grow, at which point the fungus will begin to grow on the young host.Saettler, A. February 01, 1983. Bean anthracnose Seed-transmitted disease caused by the fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum.. Extension bulletin E - Cooperative Extension Service, Michigan State University. no. 1671, (accessed March 27, 2014). Conidial anastomosis tubes Conidial anastomosis tubes as found in C. lindemuthianum. Image (f): fusion point, (b) birth scar, (c) conidia, (a) CATsMaturing colonies Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, produce conidial anastomosis tubes (CATs) between conidia before leaving the host and before germination, in contrast to the genetic model fungus Neurospora crassa (bread mould) that produces conidial anastomosis tubes from conidia and conidial germ tubes during germination. Other Colletotrichum species produce conidial anastomosis tubes as well. The initial characterization of CATs was made in this plant pathogen in 2003 by Roca et al. in Brazil. CATs first form 15 days after the start of fruiting body development and grow from the conidia. As they grow, they may either fuse with other CATs, as evidenced by fusion points, or make direct contact with another conidium. Because each conidium creates CATs, the result is a network of conidia all connected together. The CAT network is developed very quickly, often within 1 hour of the first CAT connection. The exact purpose of this connection network is unclear, but it permits free flow of cytoplasm, proteins, organelles and even nuclei between conidia. It is unclear whether these CATs can play a role in genetic recombination, as no sexual stages for C. lindemuthianum has been found in nature. Economic effects Green Bean Crop, Storeton Dry bean is an ancient crop, first domesticated over 7000 years ago and is still a staple crop globally.Pynenburg, Gerard Martin. 2010. Argonomic and economic assessment of intensive pest management of dry bean. M.Sc., University of Guelph. Retrieved 4 April 2014 Today, the largest bean producing nations are Brazil, India, China, Mexico, The United States of America, Myanmar, Canada, and Argentina. In all of these nations, anthracnose is considered one of the most invasive and destructive dry bean diseases, capable of destroying up to 95% of a plantation's yield while also threatening growth and development rates. As such, it is very important for producers to have disease-free certified seeds, which are generally produced in arid regions such as Idaho, where the relative humidity does not surpass the necessary 92% for spore germination. Further precaution is often taken by producers, who apply fungicides such as Azoxystrobin, fluodiooxonil or metalaxyl-m. Applied at a concentration of 125 grams per hectare of dry bean crop, azoxystrobin has been shown to increase bean yields by up to 20%. Growing in culture It has been known for some time that the fungus can be grown in a culture. The culture is generally made of a nutrient rich agar, as the fungus generally has a hard time germinating in water due to the water solubility of the appressorium. For optimal growth, the culture should be kept at 22 ¬∞C and at a pH of 8, although it can be grown in temperatures between 0-34 ¬∞C and pH levels between 3-11. Diseases on fungus In 1975, British mycologist Rawlinson published findings of many isometric, uniformly sized particles that he identified as double-stranded RNA viruses in the extract of the Œ±5 race of fungus. The Œ±5 race is noted for its unusually poor sporulation in cultures and its weak pathogenicity. Rawlinson hypothesized these features were caused by the observed viral particles.RAWLINSON, CJ. 1975. DOUBLE-STRANDED-RNA VIRUS IN COLLETOTRICHUM- LINDEMUTHIANUM. Transactions of the British Mycological Society 65, no. oct, (accessed April 01, 2014). However, the particles proved to be inseparable from the fungus, making an effective control difficult to acquire. Instead, he compared growth, pathogenicity and morphology of the Œ±5 race with other races of C. lindemuthianum which were not infected. No significant differences were observed between the infected and non-infected races of the pathogen, although all Œ± races proved to be highly nonnpathogenic, regularly scoring under 1 on the 5 point pathogenicity scale, whereas other races, such as the Œ¥ races, had pathogenicity ratings of 5. While the virus has no observable negative effects on the fungus, its purpose or how it infected the fungus is still unknown. References Further reading Roca M., M.

Management  Partners of the CABI-led programme, Plantwise from the Ministry of Agriculture in Zambia have several recommendations for managing C. orbiculare, these include; using certified, disease-free seed and disease tolerant varieties where possible. They also recommend rotating melons with breaks of at least 2-3 seasons with cereals, legumes or brassicas, because the disease stays in the soil for a long time. They suggest destroying any volunteer crops by burying outside of fields and pruning plants to reduce humidity and increase airflow.

History Walter Daniels was born in Chicago. Daniels became inspired to play the harmonica while in high school, when he witnessed a performance by Johnny Woods on a Public Television documentary about the blues. Harmonica players John Mayall and Paul Butterfield were later inspirations, as were Muddy Waters, Johnny Winter, and John Lee Hooker. Early on, he moved to Austin, Texas, and attended the University of Texas where he studied music theory and tenor saxophone. While still a student at the University of Texas, Daniels became a part of the Austin music scene, and in the mid-1980s became involved with a local cowpunk band called the Hickoids, playing feedback-laden harmonica on the band's Waltz-a-Cross-Dress-Texas EP. Around this time, Daniels also contributed to an acoustic string-band called the Hokum Boys, who produced mainly old-time country music. Daniels continued on in the country music format with the Hank Street Ramblers, releasing a single on Double Naut records entitled \\"Got an Itch to Floss\\". The late 1980s saw Daniels focusing on rock music, pairing up with Austin songwriter Alejandro Escovedo in Escovedo's Buick MacKane project. Around this same time, Daniels contributed to the punk band Jack O' Fire with fellow Austin musician Tim Kerr. [] In the early 1990s, Daniels teamed up with rockabilly frontman Evan Johns in a group called the Gay Sportscasters, releasing two singles on the Only Boy label. In 1994, Daniels began performing with Big Foot Chester, where he served as bandleader, vocalist, and harmonica soloist. In 1995, Daniels went into the studio with Memphis garage-rockers the Oblivians and songwriter Jeffery Evans, contributing harmonica to the Walter Daniels Plays With Monsieur Jeffrey Evans & The Oblivians at Melissa's Garage EP. [] During the 1990s, Daniels began employing the harmonica to experiments with free improvisation, originally on a track called \\"Spider Hop,\\" released as a B-side to a single by Walter Daniels & the Gospel Clodhoppers. Daniels' free improvisation continued in collaborations with North Carolinian composer Eugene Chadbourne, avant-garde trombonist David Dove, and Houston-based, Steel Guitarist Susan Alcorn, and together in concert the group performed the music of Willie Nelson, Ernest Tubb, Bob Wills, and Austin music legend Doug Sahm. This collaboration culminated in the release of the Texas Sessions studio recording. [] Daniels continues to collaborate extensively and has worked with artists as diverse as Texacala Jones, the Hard Feelings (band), John Permenter, Hunt Sales the Leroi Brothers, Roy Loney, and Earl Poole Ball.

This colorless compound is usually handled as a solution in toluene. It is a reagent for the hydrocyanation of Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketones.  Synthesis  Diethylaluminum cyanide was originally generated by treatment of triethylaluminum with a slight excess of hydrogen cyanide. The product is typically stored in ampoules because it is highly toxic. It dissolves in toluene, benzene, hexane and isopropyl ether. It undergoes hydrolysis readily and is not compatible with protic solvents. :Et3Al + HCN ‚Üí 1/n (Et2AlCN)n \\\\+ EtH  Structure  Diethylaluminum cyanide has not been examined by X-ray crystallography, although other diorganoaluminum cyanides have been. Diorganylaluminum cyanides have the general formula (R2AlCN)n, and they exist as cyclic trimers (n = 3) or tetramers (n = 4). In these oligomers, one finds AlCN-Al linkages. One compound similar to diethylaluminum cyanide is bis[di(trimethylsilyl)methyl]aluminium cyanide, ((Me3Si)2CH)2AlCN, which has been shown crystallographically to exist as a trimer with the following structure: :trimeric bis[di(trimethylsilyl)methyl]aluminium cyanide Bis(tert- butyl)aluminium cyanide, tBu2AlCN exists as a tetramer in the crystalline phase: :tetrameric bis(tert-butyl)aluminium cyanide  Uses  Diethylaluminum cyanide is used for the stoichiometric hydrocyanation of Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated ketones. The reaction is influenced by the basicity of the solvent. This effect arises from the Lewis acidic qualities of the reagent. The purpose of this reaction is to generate alkylnitriles, which are precursors to amines, amides, carboxylic acids esters and aldehydes. :500 px References External links * Category:Cyanides Category:Organoaluminium compounds ","title":"Diethylaluminium cyanide"},{"id":"11559623","text":"The DC Youth Orchestra Program (DCYOP) is an ensemble-based music education program in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1960 on the request of DC Public Schools to be the city's youth orchestra, DCYOP now enrolls over 600 students ages 4-18 every year from the DC metro area. DCYOP serves a population representative of the racial demographics of Washington, D.C.: 49% of our students identify as African American/Black, 6% as Latinx, and 16% as more than one race. (40% of DCYOP's teaching artists are of color; 20% are DCYOP alumni.) DCYOP's students are drawn from over 250 public, charter, and independent schools and live in 100 unique zip codes. DCYOP serves as a model for community, uniting students from different backgrounds with a shared passion, and is the District's only preK-12 program that seeks to make high quality, ensemble-based music education available to all students, regardless of socioeconomic status or ability. All students who are interested in learning a musical instrument are accepted into the program, and tuition assistance is offered on a sliding scale so that the program is affordable and accessible to every family. In addition, to further remove barriers to music participation for at-risk students, DCYOP offers tuition-free Children's Orchestra programming on-site at three Title I DC public elementary schools. DCYOP also offers a two-week Summer Chamber Music Intensive and one-week Summer Orchestra Intensive. DCYOP's proprietary curriculum introduces beginning musicians, who choose from 16 instruments, to instrumental group lessons. These students work with DCYOP teaching artists one hour each week to learn a musical instrument. More experienced musicians are evaluated and then placed into one of our 10 ensembles: our introductory Premier Winds (wind, brass and percussion) and Debut Strings; beginner Wind Ensemble (wind, brass and percussion), Concertino Strings, and Sinfonia Strings; intermediate Young Artists Orchestra (strings) and Repertory Orchestra (full instrumentation); and advanced Youth Philharmonic (full instrumentation), Young Virtuosi (chamber orchestra), and our renowned Youth Orchestra (full instrumentation). Each ensemble meets one to three hours weekly for sectionals and rehearsals. DCYOP also offers a tuition-free chamber music program for intermediate and advanced students. DCYOP graduates enjoy successful careers across many disciplines. Alumni are professional musicians in the National Symphony Orchestra and other orchestras, Grammy and Emmy Award winners, New York Times best-selling authors, CEOs, cancer surgeons, Broadway stars, \\"Saturday Night Live\\" cast members, and civic leaders including DC Mayor Muriel Bowser. Many alumni point to DCYOP as a significant factor in their success. DCYOP's Executive Director is Elizabeth Schurgin. Evan Ross Solomon serves as Artistic Director.

Apart from Naval District Washington, the Districts were disestablished and renamed Navy Regions about 1999, and are now under Commander, Naval Installations Command (CNIC). They were established for the purpose of decentralizing the Navy Department's functions with respect to the control of the coastwise sea communications and the shore activities outside the department proper, and for the further purpose of centralizing under one command: : (a) For military coordination, all naval activities, and : (b) For administrative coordination, all naval activities with specific exceptions, within the district and the waters thereof. The limits of the naval districts are laid down in article 1480, Navy Regulations. Those limits extend to seaward so far as to include the coastwise sea lanes (art. 1486 (1), Navy Regulations). \\"Each naval district shall be commanded by a designated commandant, who is the direct representative of the Navy Department, including its bureaus and offices, in all matters affecting district activity\\" (Art. 1481, Navy Regulations.).  1st Naval District  The boundaries of the First Naval District, to be headquartered at Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine (and later in Boston), were established on 7 May 1903 in accordance with General Order No. 128, signed by Acting Secretary of the Navy Charles H. Darling. Until late 1915 no personnel were assigned to the district staff. In 1945 the district was headquartered at Boston, Massachusetts, and consisted of the following geographic areas: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island (including Block Island). The First Naval District was disestablished on 7 October 1976 and control passed to the Fourth Naval District.  2nd Naval District  Created with the other original districts in 1903, the Second Naval District was the smallest of the lot. It was headquartered in Newport, Rhode Island, and covered only Rhode Island and adjacent waters. It was disestablished and its areas incorporated into the First and Third Districts on March 15, 1919, after the end of World War I.  3rd Naval District  The Third Naval District, headquartered at New York, New York, was established on 7 May 1903 in accordance with General Order No. 128, signed by Acting Secretary of the Navy Charles H. Darling. Puerto Rico was initially part of the district due to good communications between New York and Puerto Rico. In 1919 Puerto Rico was removed from the district and placed directly under the control of the Chief of Naval Operations. In 1945 the district, still headquartered at New York, consisted of the following geographic areas: Connecticut, New York, the northern part of New Jersey (including counties of Mercer, Monmouth, and all counties north thereof), and also the Nantucket Shoals Lightship. The Third Naval District was disestablished on 7 October 1976 and functions were transferred to the Fourth Naval District.  4th Naval District  The boundaries of the Fourth Naval District, to be headquartered at League Island Navy Yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, were established on 7 May 1903 in accordance with General Order No. 128, signed by Acting Secretary of the Navy Charles H. Darling. No personnel were assigned to the district staff until late 1915. In 1945 the district, still headquartered in Philadelphia, consisted of the following geographic areas: Pennsylvania, the southern part of New Jersey (including the counties of Burlington, Ocean, and all counties south thereof), and Delaware (including Winter Quarters Shoal Light Vessel). On 7 October 1976 this command absorbed the functions of the First and Third Naval Districts.

Its first chairman was Boyan Petkanchin (1907‚Äì87) who worked to promote and disseminate the knowledge of mathematical logic both in the professional mathematical community in Bulgaria and as popular science. Vladimir Sotirov and Radoslav Pavlov joined the department in 1970, followed by George Gargov, Anatoly Buda, Lyubomir Ivanov, Slavyan Radev and Solomon Passy in 1976-89. In 1996-2000 the department was joined by Dimiter Dobrev, Jordan Zashev and Dimitar Guelev. From 1971 to 1989 the department was merged with the corresponding division of the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics at Sofia University, with Dimiter Skordev heading the integrated structure since 1971. In 1989 the institutional relationship with Sofia University was severed, and the department resumed as a division of the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics, headed since then by Lyubomir Ivanov. The logicians Bogdan Dyankov, Hristo Smolenov, Veselin Petrov and Marion Mircheva stayed with the department for various periods of time, all of them coming from the Institute of Philosophy at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences once the latter was dissolved on account of the dissident activities of its members in 1989. The research of the department is mostly in the area of algebraic recursion theory, modal, temporal and other non-classical logics, as well as logic programming including the development of a version of the Prolog programming language. The department developed also the Streamlined System adopted as the official national system for the Romanization of Bulgarian, and eventually codified by the Bulgarian Law of Transliteration in 2009. A joint multi-institutional project led by the department has contributed to the development and introduction of a new Bulgarian phonetic keyboard layout for personal computers and mobile phones. Besides their research activities, members of the department have an extensive lecturing practice at various faculties of Sofia University as well as other Bulgarian universities. Some members of the department have earned public recognition for their non-academic activities. Sotirov, Ivanov, and Passy were returned MPs in the VII Grand National Assembly on the side of the Union of Democratic Forces, and co-authored the new Bulgarian Constitution. In 2011 the departments of Mathematical Logic and Algebra were merged to form the Department of Algebra and Logic at the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.

In 1997, she got her first Takarazuka Bow Hall show (Angels at Dawn). One of the characteristics of her Takarazuka career is that she had participated in the most overseas performances among her generation: New York City in 1992, London in 1994, Hong Kong in 1998 and Seoul in 2005 (performing Rose of Versailles as a part of the celebration of the establishment of Japan-Korea relationship). Upon the founding the Cosmos Troupe, she participated in her second production of Elisabeth in 1998 and got great applause with her portrayal of Luigi Lucheni (she played Elmer Batthyany in the 1996-7 Star Troupe production). In the 1998 production of Wuthering Heights, she had the role of Edgar in the previous Snow production, who later succeeded her to be the top star of Star Troupe). During the founding era of Cosmos, she got her second Bow Hall lead (The Tempest, as a part of Bow Shakespeare Series) in 1999.

It is located in the center part of Bogot√°. This district is mostly inhabited by lower middle and working class residents. The district was named after an old bridge in the hacienda of Juan Aranda over the \\"Chin√∫a River\\", now called the San Francisco River, that dates to the 16th century. Puente Aranda has of area which are almost entirely urban. This locality has more than 300,000 inhabitants, 5% of the total urban area inhabitants of Bogota.  Geography  To the north, the locality of Puente Aranda borders Calle 19, which serves as boundary with the locality of Teusaquillo. To the south Puente Aranda borders the Autopista Sur and the localities of Tunjuelito and Antonio Nari√±o, to the east with the main avenue Norte-Quito-Sur and the locality of Los M√°rtires. To the west, Puente Aranda borders the Avenida Carrera 68 and the localities of Kennedy and Fontib√≥n. Puente Aranda was in the past a convergence of many streams and wetlands on the Bogot√° savanna. It suffered frequent floodings, in contrast with the now almost entirely urbanized flat area with a slight increase in elevation from east to west. The Fucha River, the San Cristobal River and the \\"Canal de los Comuneros\\" crosses the locality among other canalized streams like Seco River, La Albania River, and the San Francisco River.  History  = Colonial and Postcolonial = The Puente Aranda hacienda was property of Don Jorge Aranda, and was established in a marshy terrain south of the then village of Santaf√© in the 16th century by the oidor Francisco de Anuncibay who arrived to the New Kingdom of Granada in the year 1537. This hacienda was first named \\"Hacienda of Aranda\\" and \\"The Roof of the Jorges\\", where the rivers Chin√∫a and San Agust√≠n merged. It was also the main western path to get to the Magdalena River, which was and still is the most important fluvial artery of Colombia and a bridge was built to facilitate this. Floodings of the Bogot√° River and its tributaries was frequent. In 1768, a bridge was reconstructed with a better structure and named Puente de Aranda (Aranda's Bridge). Then, an esplanade was built along across the wetlands, towards the west in an effort to connect Bogot√° with the port of Honda along the Magdalena River. This way, Honda was then connected to Fontib√≥n and the \\"Avenida de Encomienda\\", nowadays Calle 13 (Avenida del Centenario). Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and his troops camped in the Hacienda of Aranda in 1814 during the wars of independence from Spain. In 1898 the southern line of the Railway of Bogot√° was established which connected Bogota with the Tequendama Falls area as part of the development of the region. The area was until the beginning of the 20th century a rural area of many haciendas. = Urbanization = By 1944, the rapid expansion of Bogot√° towards the south reached the Puente Aranda area, the Aranda bridge was demolished to build Avenida de Las Am√©ricas, a project supported by the Colombian Society of Architects, which would join Calle 13 and dividing into two ways; Calle 13 towards Fontib√≥n and Avenida de Las Am√©ricas towards the locality of Kennedy. The area where these two ways intersect is the site of the new Aranda bridge and the name of the neighborhood of Puente Aranda surrounding the crossing. The area then had a rapid residential and industrial development, with numerous small manufacturing businesses basing their operations in the area. Puente Aranda was zonified and consolidated with the Pilot Plan for Bogot√° in 1951. In 1963, Puente Aranda and its neighboring barrios were declared sectors of Bogota only after Chapinero which had been named a zone in 1954. Since then, Puente Aranda has been producing industrial products as textiles, chemicals, metallurgy, food and services. Puente Aranda then extended to conurbate with the localities of Fontib√≥n and Kennedy to the west, and Antonio Nari√±o and Rafael Uribe Uribe to the south. In 1972, the \\"Special District of Bogot√°\\" was created and divided the city into 16 zones, each of them served by a minor city hall. This was done in an effort to begin establishing a Metropolitan Area for Bogot√°. The 16 mayors, heading the different zones, were appointed by the Mayor of Bogot√°. This system was ratified in an agreement in the year 1977. With the Colombian Constitution of 1991, the Special District became the Capital District dividing Bogot√° into 20 localities and its minor city hall became a local city hall with its city council and a local administrative board.  Demography  The locality has an increasing rhythm of development which by the year 2000 had 1794 city blocks, 700 of these industrial and some 800 residential. There are five relatively important neighborhoods considered Units of Zone Planification: * Ciudad Montes * San Rafael * Muzu * Puente Aranda * Corridor Industrial = Population = The first census was done in 1973, in which Puente Aranda had an estimated population of 221,776 inhabitants. In the 1985 Census Puente Aranda registered a population of 305,123 inhabitants and since then the population started to decrease due to the construction of new residential areas in other parts of Bogot√°. In 1993, Puente Aranda registered a population of 282,491 inhabitants. According to the 2005 Census, Puente Aranda had grown to 370,292 inhabitants.  Transportation  Puente Aranda is surrounded by the Avenida Carrera 68, the Carrera 30, the Avenida de Las Am√©ricas, Calle 13, Calle 19, Calle 3, Calle 6 and Carrera 50, which are its most important roads. It also includes a section over the Avenida Primero de Mayo, all these streets are covered by different bus routes which connect Puente Aranda to the rest of the city. The locality is also served by the bus rapid transit system TransMilenio, with multiple stops on the F and G lines; Marsella, Pradera, Distrito Grafiti, Puente Aranda, Carrera 43, Industrial Zone and CDS Carrera 32.

The word Nashwaaksis comes from the Maliseet language, with the \\"-sis\\" appendage meaning \\"little Nashwaak\\".  History  = Fort Nashwaak = The Nashwaaksis area was first used for seasonal farming by the Mi'kmaq and Maliseet peoples. The first European contact was by the French in the late 17th Century, who granted the land to Joseph de Villebon. In 1691-1692, he built Fort Nashwaak, also called Fort St. Joseph, on the north side of the Saint John River at the mouth of the Nashwaak River. It replaced Fort Jemseg as the capital of Acadia. In 1696 the fort was subject to a siege by the English.Webster, John Clarence. Acadia at the End of the Seventeenth Century. Saint John, NB, The New Brunswick Museum, 1979. P. 11 After de Villebon's death in 1700 and a devastating flood, the fort was abandoned. The site of the former fort was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1924. = British Settlement = Nashwaaksis was settled in the 1760s following the Seven Years' War and developed into a riverfront community opposite what would become the provincial capital at Point Ste-Anne. The community grew with improved transportation links to the city, first with ferry services, then railway and road bridges, culminating in the present Westmorland Street Bridge which includes the perimeter road Route 105 around the neighbourhood. The community of Nashwaaksis became a neighbourhood of Fredericton following municipal amalgamation in 1973.

Enrollment as of December 2019 is 567.  History  Confederation S.S. was built as a Canadian Centennial project, and opened in September 1967, making it the first English secondary school in Valley East, Ontario.  Football  Like all sports teams at Confederation, the mascot is a Charger. Its football program began in 1968 with a Junior Program but, due to financial constraints and a serious injury to a player, the team was discontinued in the mid-1980s. Confederation was without football from that time until the fall of 2002 when it fielded a varsity team which posted a 2‚Äì4 record in its first season. This was considered an accomplishment as the last expansion team of Sudbury District Secondary School Athletic Association, the St. Benedict Catholic Secondary School Bears, had to wait a full seven seasons before their first win. The Chargers have become a regular member of the post-season. In 2003, they made the playoffs for the first time and knocked off the perennial powerhouse St. Charles College Cardinals by a score of 30‚Äì16. They then handed the previously undefeated Lasalle Secondary School Lancers their only loss of the season in the championship game by a score of 14-7. Interest in football all across Greater Sudbury then spiked as several high schools hoped to duplicate Confederation's success. The Sudbury Secondary School Northstars took the field for the first time in over 20 years in 2003 but were unable to match the Chargers' success, going winless in three of four seasons and folding in 2007. To replace them that fall was the Lively District Secondary School Hawks who have traditionally fielded excellent flag football teams. However, in their first season, they also went winless.  Outdoor education  Situated in Northern Ontario's Boreal Forest, Confederation offers an outdoor education program. These courses provide opportunities to develop a personalized approach to healthy active living through participation in classroom activities combined with strenuous outdoor experiences. Students are expected to explore and demonstrate appropriate knowledge, skills, and attitudes in three interconnected themes: * Outdoor Skills ‚Äì necessary for safe comfortable outdoor experiences in all seasons * Personal Development ‚Äì team-building and leadership skills which stress understanding, respect, and appreciation for self and others * Environmental Understanding ‚Äì awareness and respect of all living things and an understanding of basic ecological processes Students learn wilderness skills such as first aid, Nordic skiing, snowshoeing, winter camping, wilderness survival, ecology, hiking, orienteering, backpacking, swimming, canoeing, weather interpretation, teamwork, and leadership. Each semester the classes take canoe trips through the Temagami wilderness, hiking trips in Killarney Provincial Park, and a winter camping trip where they sleep in quinzhees they have constructed.  Music  Confederation is the home of the Evolutionary Rock Band. It was started and run by teacher Norm McIntosh since 1979 (when it was known as the Confed Rock Band). McIntosh was the inaugural recipient of the Canadian Music Teacher of the Year Juno award. He was presented $25000 for the band's many costs on behalf of the musicians' band-aid program. The band consists of four vocalists, an eight-piece rhythm section, four trumpets, four trombones, two alto saxes, four tenor saxes, and a 15-member stage crew. The crew can be farther divided into jobs including sound technicians, guitar effects technicians, light and effects technicians, a fog technician, two spotlight operators, and a crew manager. Evolutionary band and crew member students are between the ages of 14 and 18. The band was featured on Canada AM in April 2007 for its success in breaking the Guinness world record for 'deepest concert below the Earth's surface'. The record was broken at below sea level at 3400 level of CVRD Inco's Copper Cliff North Mine, Copper Cliff, Ontario. In 2008, Evolutionary was recognized as Junior Citizens of the Year at the Community Builders Awards of Excellence for the City of Greater Sudbury. Evolutionary has been visited by such artists as The Tragically Hip, Hedley, Keisha Chante, Sloan, Suzie McNeil, The Trews, Three Days Grace, Finger Eleven, music publishing executives Mike McCarty, and Deane Cameron and record producer Bob Ezrin. Despite the fact that most of the bands' activities take place outside regular school hours, the students involved in the Evolutionary band receive a full credit towards high school graduation. Confederation is the only school in Canada with a professional recording studio. This recording studio is used for a full-credit recording course, which is the only one of its type in Ontario at the high school level. Students are taught how to use the most up-to-date recording software. They gain experience working on short CDs for local artists and they learn how to make radio commercials.  Drama and improvisation  The school has a beginning theater production as well as an improv team in the Canadian Improv tournament. The production and the team have been there for four years and consist of grades 9-12.

The school, built in 1969, is within by the Rainbow District School Board's jurisdiction. History Research conducted over a 10-year period in the 1970s revealed a trend at Manitoulin Secondary School of directing First Nations students into the lower academic streams. The study also showed nearly all suspensions and expulsions were of First Nations students, despite them forming less than half of the student body. As a result, Wikwemikong removed their children from Rainbow District and formed their own high school in their community, resulting in a significant decline in the student population at Manitoulin Secondary School. In 2015, an Indigenous student at the school left after receiving backlash for reporting a racist incident from school administrators. In 2018, a fight broke out on the school grounds involving 50 students, both European-Canadian and Indigenous. The Chief of M'Chigeeng First Nation wrote an open letter stating, \\"that this incident is an indicator of a deeper, more disturbing reality, which is underlying racism that has now reared its ugly head yet again.\\" The school hosted an \\"anti-racism rally\\" in response to these events.

He captained Kent for three months in 1937 and served in both World War I and World War II. He worked professionally for Lloyds Bank. Early life Bryan was born in Beckenham in Kent, the second son of Lindsay and Emily Bryan. His father was a solicitor. Bryan attended St Andrews' Preparatory School in Eastbourne before following his brother Jack on to Rugby School.Lewis P (2014) For Kent and Country, pp.122‚Äì123. Brighton: Reveille Press. He was in the Cricket XI from 1913 to 1915, initially as a bowler. Military service At the outbreak of World War I Bryan was still at school and was too young to enlist. In 1915, aged 17, he joined the Territorial Force, being awarded a commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the 5th Battalion, the Manchester Regiment, the same battalion his brother Jack was serving in and the brother's father had been a Lieutenant-colonel in.Lewis op. cit., pp,128‚Äì129. He was initially posted to a Provisional Battalion as he was too young to serve overseas. He was promoted to Lieutenant in 1917 and, in January 1918, posted to the main complement of the battalion, now old enough to serve on the front line. Bryan arrived on the Western Front in France in April 1918 and was attached to the Royal Sussex Regiment at Friville in the Somme sector. He saw action in the Hundred Days Offensive and was in action until the end of the war. After the Armistice he volunteered for service in the Army of Occupation on the Rhine and was stationed in Germany until the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919 and was transferred to the Territorial Reserve in February 1921. At the outbreak of World War II Bryan was reappointed to the Reserve of Officers before seeing action with the Manchester Regiment in France. He was evacuated from Dunkirk with the Manchesters alongside his brother Jack. In 1942 he was appointed Lieutenant in the Royal Armoured Corps. He was awarded a Bronze Star in 1948, a US award which could be awarded to anyone who had served with US forces. Cricket career Bryan was a left-handed batsman. He played with his brother Jack for Kent's Second XI in 1914 as well as for the Club and Ground side before the start of World War I. He made his first-class cricket debut for Kent against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in June 1920, going on to play five times for the country during the 1920 season as well as six times for the Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship.Ronnie Bryan, CricketArchive.

The show is both traditionally animated (for the adventure story) and computer animated (for the Bible stories). It takes place from 69 - 71 AD, during the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War. There are three seasons or \\"series\\", each comprising 13 episodes: Season 1 is set in Alexandria, Egypt; Season 2 in Jerusalem and Season 3 in Rome. The series was created by Brian D. Brown and Eric J. Danenberg, who also worked on The Storykeepers. Starting with the second season, the show is produced in HD. All three series have now been translated and dubbed into Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin, and Taiwan Mandarin), French, German, Hindi, Korean, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, North American Spanish, and Manx Gaelic. Gary Kurtz, the producer for season one, also produced American Graffiti, Star Wars, and The Empire Strikes Back. Format The show starts with a recap of last week's episode, relevant or not. Then the theme song plays. Act 1 begins with the name of the episode. There's usually about ten minutes of story and then a Bible story, followed by Act 2. There's more story and then another Bible story. Unless it is a two-part episode, the problem is resolved after the second Bible story. There are, however, three Bible stories in one episode. Story =Alexandria (AD 69)= The series begins in the year 69 AD, in Alexandria. There is a rebellion going on in nearby Judea by the Jews and Christians. In response, the governor, Tiberius orders his men, led by Brutacus and Tobias, to crack down on the Jews and Christians. In the first episode introduces the family of Samuel, Diana, their son Macky, and their rarely seen parrot, Pontius, who live in Delta Quarter on the port of Alexandria. They are rebels who hide other rebels in their house. Samuel's friend, a commander for the rebels in Judea, sends his daughters, Leah and Rebecca, to live with Samuel's family. In episode two, Macky and Rebecca have an encounter with a girl named Portia while riding horses. After talking, they find out that she is the Governor's niece. She becomes fast friends with Samuel's family, but they never tell her that they are rebels. Episode three introduces the characters of Miriam and Nathan, Samuel and Diana's friends, as well as fellow rebels. We are also introduced to their adopted African son, Sollie. The entire first season is primarily a series of journeys, trying to protect rebels without the Governor or his cronies finding out. In the third-to-last episode, however, Tobias finds out the truth and they are all forced to flee Alexandria. =Jerusalem (AD 70)= Macky and Portia arrive in Jerusalem during the Roman siege. The people inside are starving, whilst the Romans grow desperate to break through the city walls. Outside the city, Macky makes several key acquaintances. One is Isaac, who pretends to be senile most of the time, but is actually an active member of the rebel underground. His house, filled with hidden rooms and secret passages, is a safe house for the oppressed. Here Macky links up with the rebels (zealots) who live inside Jerusalem and soon becomes a courier between Jerusalem and the outside world. Inside Jerusalem, Macky meets a girl, Sarah. Macky is drawn to Sarah's idealism, which puts a strain on his relationship with Portia. He also meets a Roman officer named Lucius, widowed father of two young children and secretly a Friend of Jesus ‚Äì he was one of Paul's guards, many years earlier in Rome. Macky learns to trust Lucius and he becomes a valued secret ally as Macky faces two old adversaries from Alexandria: Tobias and Brutacus. Towards the end of the siege, Macky takes greater and greater risks, and is finally captured by the Romans. Portia tries to intervene, but can‚Äôt get him released. Instead she ensures that Macky is sent to Rome, her next destination, and his only hope. =Rome (AD 71)= Arriving in Rome, Macky finds himself in a gladiator school for the Circus Maximus, where the only rule is kill or be killed. Macky wants to do neither, so Portia intervenes with a Senator, Antonius, who takes Macky as a slave. Macky discovers that Antonius is a secret Friend of Jesus and that at night, he dons a mask and goes out and rescues fellow Friends of Jesus from jail or helps them escape from slave-masters. Soon Macky in a disguise of his own starts helping the Senator. Antonius has an enemy in the Senate - Marcus, who blames all the Empire's woes on the Friends of Jesus. Marcus would like to prove the notorious masked rebel is actually his enemy, Antonius. But Antonius is too clever for him. Marcus enlists the help of Tiberius, Brutacus, Tobias and Tobias‚Äô mother Luciana, an expert manipulator and political in-fighter with friends in high places. Marcus begins to tighten his grip on Macky and Antonius, and Macky's and Portia's relationship deepens and matures through the difficult choices they have to make.

It was a best-seller in 19th- century Britain, becoming the British Empire's most sensational ethnographic fiction in the first half of the 19th century; its avid readers included Queen Victoria. It was one of the best-selling crime novels of the 19th century, and was the most influential novel about India prior to Rudyard Kipling's Kim (1901). The novel's popularity established the word \\"thug\\" in the English language.  Plot  The plot revolves around a fictional anti-hero protagonist, Ameer Ali, a Muslim thug. This book is a tale of crime and retribution in India, beginning in the late 18th century and ending in 1832. The story lays bare the practices of the Thugs, or \\"deceivers\\" as they were called, who murdered travellers for money and valuables. This work was originally published in 1839 and reprinted in 1873.  Characters  * Ameer Ali: The novel's protagonist, a Pathan (Pashtun) Muslim adopted and raised by a thug. After becoming a prominent jemadar, he and his father relocate to Jhalone and gain the confidence of the local ruler, Raja Govindrao II. * The Englishman: Ameer Ali's interlocutor and a stand-in for Phillip Meadows Taylor. His interviews of Ameer Ali provides a frame for the narrative of the novel. The Englishman describes the physical appearance of Ameer Ali in his imprisonment and will occasionally express moral outrage at some part of the tale, or otherwise offer criticism. * Ismail: The adopted father of Ameer Ali. A respected and high-ranking Muslim thug, he is childless and adopts Ameer Ali. During the first half of the story, Ismail and his family live in a small village near Nagpur. * Bhudrinath: A Hindu thug and early peer of Ameer Ali. He is an expert in the religious ceremonies of the Thuggee faction. * Peer Khan: A Muslim thug and another close ally of Ameer Ali. He retires from thuggee to become a fakir. * Gunesha: A prominent Hindu thug of Ismail's generation. He serves as Ameer Ali's antagonist in the second half of the story. * Cheetoo: A prominent leader of pindari expeditions. Ameer Ali and several thugs join him as mercenary soldiers.  Historicity  Ameer Ali, the fictional anti-hero protagonist of Confessions of a Thug, is a composite of multiple real-life thugs: Feringhea, Ameer Alee, and Aman Subahdar. Feringhea was a jamadar, or captain, and led many expeditions before turning into a prolific informer for the British.Sleeman, W. H. S. (1840).

The historical Ameer Alee, who provided the fictional character's name, was a low-ranking thug mentioned only twice by Sleeman in his definitive work.Sleeman, W. H. S. (1840). Page 63. Finally, Aman Subahdar was described by Sleeman as \\"the foremost thug of his day,\\" but died before the events of the novel conclude. One scene in the novel, in which a thug band led by Ameer Ali suffers a misfortune, is lifted almost word-for-word from Sleeman's book. In the historical version, Aman Subahdar led the expedition.Sleeman, W. H. S. (1840). Page 386. Further, Feringhea and Aman Subahdar were cousins but no such comparable character exists in the novel.

It was In use until 1902 but vacated pre-1973. It is now in ruins. Paulstown Castle represents one of the elements of the architectural heritage of County Kilkenny. A middle- size house of distinctive appearance reputedly built to designs prepared by William Robertson (1770‚Äì1850). The house remains of additional importance for the historic associations with the Flood family of nearby View Mount House, the Healy family, and for the reputed connections with Sir Pearse Butler.  Shankill Castle  Shankill Castle and Gardens is set in parkland on the border between County Carlow and County Kilkenny. Visitors can walk in the grounds and gardens, and there are guided tours of the house. Shankill Castle started as a Bulter tower-house near the ruins of an old church. Peter Aylward bought the lands from his wife's family in 1708, and it was rebuilt and set in a formal landscape with a vista to the front and canal to the rear. In the 19th century, it was enlarged and castellated, serpentine bays added to the canal and an unusual polyhedral sundial given pride of place on a sunken lawn. Other additions were a gothic porch bearing the Aylward crest and a conservatory. The stable-yard and the castellated entrance to the demesne are attributed to Daniel Robertson.

History The 64th Brigade Support Battalion was originally constituted as the 64th Quartermaster Battalion on 29 April 1942 and activated on 15 August 1942 at Camp Barkeley, Texas as the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Laundry). = World War II = The battalion arrived in Lydney, England on 16 December 1943 and was redesignated the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot) or \\"64th QMBD,\\" under the command structure of the Advanced Section (ADSEC) directly supporting the 12th Army Group throughout the war in support of the European Theater of Operations (ETO). alt= The battalion participated in Operation Overlord in Normandy under the command of LTC Albert Barden. The 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot) was the first major sustainment organization to arrive on the beachhead of Normandy, following the axis of advance by pushing classes of supply across the English Channel. For the period from D+41 through D+90, ADSEC had requisitioned enough spare parts to maintain a 30-day level in each using unit and an additional 30-day supply in the army Class II depot. Quartermaster units were to carry a 90-day supply of special-purpose spare parts, which would last until the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot) could establish a central parts depot on the European continent. On 13 July 1944 at Isigny- sur-Mer, the battalion was specifically tasked with collecting personal effects and baggage for the safe return to the United States, management of graves registration following the invasion of Normandy, and managing the captured German prisoner of war population. On 29 September 1944, the battalion established a base depot, Q-256, in Reims, in order to conduct salvage operations for the 12th Army Group. It became the largest single salvage installation in the ETO with the purpose of undertaking fifth echelon maintenance and manufacturing projects never contemplated by the War Department. Depot Q-256 was administered by the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot) and operated by the 696th QM Salvage Repair Company (Fixed); these two units had been trained together at Lydney, and combined a total of 586 attached service troops or civilian employees, not including employed German prisoners of war, whose numbers swelled twenty times that number. Depot Q-256, with its facilities scattered throughout the city of Reims, received overflow salvage directly from the armies. In addition to routine processing and packaging, the depot conducted a program of manufacturing, remodeling, and improvisation. Scrap materials were used to reinforce paratroop trousers, fabricate Browning Automatic Rifle belts and rocket ammunition pouches, and patch tent-age. Materials ostensibly destined for scrap were converted into other types of end items: old tires were used to make soles for prisoners' shoes, badly torn shirts and raincoats were transformed into wiping rags, aprons, and typewriter covers, and old wool was converted into \\"shoddy\\" blankets. Besides the fixed repair activities at Reims salvage depot, twelve mobile repair teams and two technical crews worked out of this installation in answer to calls from the field. Ultimately, Q-256 also had to operate a complete machine shop where motors and other heavy equipment, including QM equipment trailers, were rebuilt, although this was originally a responsibility of Ordnance. Such activities were performed in rented French shops with captured German lathes, presses, and other heavy duty machinery. Sufficient machine tools were available to permit the occasional manufacture of badly needed spare parts such as flame cups for one-burner stoves and rotors for gasoline dispensers. By the end of March 1945 the Reims salvage depot occupied 500,000 square feet of closed space and 350,000 feet of open space; this was more than double the total space set aside for Quartermaster salvage and reclamation in all the U.K. depots as of January 1944. At the close of 1944, the depot had processed nine million items, and in March 1945 it was handling 160,000 pieces per day. Items processed in the United Kingdom shortly after D-day for shipment to the continent were in particularly chaotic condition. During the second half of November 1944, combat units of First Army complained that items arriving in the forward areas marked Class B clothing were not suitable for issue, and also reports from its own field liaison officers that 80 percent of the clothing located at Utah Beach marked Class X was actually combat serviceable and included such scarce items as field jackets. COL Beny Rosaler, chief of the Field Service Division, had a solution: assign the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot), which was in Riems at that time, with the task of sorting out the confusion. COL Rosaler commented that \\"it required highly qualified personnel with good judgment.\\" Sign posted outside Dolhain, Belgium next to the typewriter factor During the German occupation of Belgium, following the Battle of Belgium, occupying German forces turned Dolhain, Belgium into a wartime production factory for German-made Olympia typewriters for their war effort. Typewriters had become scarce as the war raged on, and the US government had started a domestic campaign to collect old typewriters for use by allied forces. The allied advance from Paris to the Rhine led to the liberation of cities in the vicinity of the city of Liege, including Dolhain, and subsequent the German destruction of the town as they retreated across the Rhine. The 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot) reestablished a base depot in Liege and Dolhain, repaired the heavily damaged typewriter factory in order to have typewriters reproduced, this time for the allies' war effort. Initially, ADSEC made use of the famous Red Ball Express to rapidly push supplies following the breakout from the beaches of Normandy until November 1944. On 25 March 1945, four \\"XYZ express routes\\" were established; the four XYZ routes extended eastward from Li√®ge, Dueren, Luxembourg, and Nancy to support the 12th Army Group in the final push of the Rhineland Campaign. Months before V-E Day, Office of the Theater Chief Quartermaster had started to plan the post- hostilities organization of Quartermaster activities. Cherbourg, Li√®ge - including the battalion's base of operations, Reims, and Nancy-Metz were to be closed down as soon as their stocks were exhausted and Paris was to be reduced to a minor issue depot for the rear headquarters. 12th Army Group inactivated in July 1945 following the Rhineland Campaign and defeat of the axis powers. No history exists until the battalion was deactivated on 1 March 1949 at Camp Lee, Virginia. = Cold War & Vietnam War = 1st Logistical Command (now the 1st Theater Sustainment Command) shoulder sleeve insignia for Soldiers assigned to the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Petroleum Operating) during Vietnam. alt= From 19 September 1950 to 20 October 1953, the 64th Quartermaster Battalion was briefly reactivated in West Germany during heightened tensions during the Cold War but did not see combat in Korea. On 26 March 1963, the battalion was reactivated and redesignated as the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Petroleum Operations) at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. From 15 April 1966 to 28 February 1970, the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Petroleum Operations) was deployed to Long Binh, Vietnam under the 53rd General Support Group, US Army Support Command Saigon,1st Logistical Command, United States Army Vietnam.https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:64QM_BN_(PO)_Vietnam_MUC_(2)_1970_Submission_to_HRC.pdfThe battalion was tasked organized with the following companies: # Headquarters Detachment, 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Assigned) ## 47th Transportation Company (Medium Truck) (Petroleum) (Attached) ## 223d Supply and Service Company (Direct Support) (Attached) ## 512th Quartermaster Company (Petroleum) ## 538th Transportation Company (Medium Truck) (Petroleum) (Attached) ## 556th Transportation Company (Medium Truck) (Petroleum) (Attached) Because of their resolute courage in the face of the enemy, no operation was delayed because of petroleum unavailability. Further, the Binh Loi-Tan Son Nhut pipeline operated by the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Petroleum Operations) supplied more than 190,000,000 gallons of fuel to the Ton Son Nhut areas with remarkable efficiency. III Corps Tactical Zone. During this period the battalion delivered more than 300,000,000 gallons of bulk fuel in tank vehicles and drove more than 7,000,000 miles under the most adverse and hazardous conditions in support of major tactical maneuvers. The battalion had 10 Soldiers killed in the four years it was deployed. Through their unrelenting perseverance, consummate knowledge and devotion to mission accomplishment, the members of the unit contributed immeasurably to the free world struggle against Communist aggression in the Republic of Vietnam. On 8 April 1970, 28 years from the month it was constituted, the battalion was deactivated in Vietnam. = Post-Vietnam and late Cold War = left On 1 December 1975, the battalion was reactivated as the 64th Support Battalion (Forward) and assigned to the Division Support Command (DISCOM), 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Carson, where it began its long association with the 4th Infantry Division. It deployed as a task force, with 550 personnel to Wiesbaden, West Germany, as part of 4th Brigade, 4th Infantry Division (M) or \\"Brigade 76\\" in April 1976. This deployment was a task force used as a rapid deployment unit with a mechanized brigade made up of units from Fort Carson all of which were on a rotational assignment basis. When expected cost savings from the use of rotation force failed to materialize, the brigade was permanently reassigned to Europe and served in Germany until its deactivation on 15 September 1984 in Germany. Quartermaster Professional Bulletin, Summer 1993 - featuring the 64th Brigade Support Battalion's linage and picture of refueling operations of a tank from the alt=alt= On 15 May 1987, the battalion was reactivated as the 64th Forward Support Battalion under the DISCOM, 4th Infantry Division (M) with a support relationship with 3d Brigade, 4th Infantry Division (M). Following the Gulf War, the battalion rotated on a deployment to Kuwait with 3d Brigade in support of Operation INTRINSIC ACTION 95-03, Phase II to deter Saddam Hussein from another invasion of Kuwait.https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Announcement_of_Campaign_Streamer_for_Southwest_Asia_GO_2005-09.pdf The 64th Forward Support Battalion remained in Fort Carson with 3d Brigade, 4th Infantry Division (M) when the rest of the division (e.g. Headquarters, 4th Infantry Division; 1st Brigade, 2d Brigade, DISCOM, and Aviation Brigade) relocated to Fort Hood, TX in 1995. = Global War on Terrorism = Since the beginning of the Global War on Terrorism, the battalion has deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2003 to 2004, 2005 to 2006, 2007 to 2009, and 2010 to 2011; Operation Inherent Resolve in 2015; and Operation Spartan Shield in 2019. The battalion only had two Soldiers killed throughout all deployments. Alerted on 19 January 2003, the 4th Infantry Division was scheduled to take part in the Iraq War in the spring of 2003 by spearheading an advance from Turkey into northern Iraq. The Turkish Parliament refused to grant permission for the operation and the division's equipment remained offshore on ships during the buildup for the war. Instead, the 4th Infantry Division or \\"Task Force Iron Horse\\" was tasked as a follow-on force to secure the volatile Sunni Triangle. 3d Brigade (Strikers) was tasked with moving along the east side of the Tigris River to seize Samarra. After suppressing the former regime forces and stabilizing the lawlessness, the brigade assisted the 173d Airborne Brigade in Kirkuk. By June 2003, 1st Brigade occupied Tikrit, 2nd Brigade occupied Baqubah, and 3d Brigade occupied Balad and Samarra. Throughout this time, the 64th Brigade Support Battalion began building up Logistical Support Area Anaconda under the command of then-LTC Gustave Perna once the airfield was seized, which became one of the largest logistical complexes throughout the war. In March 2004, the battalion redeployed to home to Fort Carson with 3d Brigade. On 16 December 2004 in accordance with the transformation of the Army, the 64th Forward Support Battalion was redesignated the 64th Brigade Support Battalion. As part of the modular transformation, assets previously held at division level, but habitually attached a division's brigades during operations were made organic to those brigades. The 64th Brigade Support Battalion was relieved from assignment to DISCOM, 4th Infantry Division and reassigned to the redesignated 3d Heavy Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division with a direct-support relationship. From 1 November 2005 to January 2007, the 64th Brigade Support Battalion deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom. During the deployment, the battalion and 3d Brigade were attached as part of the larger \\"Task Force Band of Brothers,\\" 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). The 3rd Brigade Combat Team's mission included training the Iraqi Security Forces, assisting in the rebuilding of the Diyala Province infrastructure, as well as continuing to root out the anti-Iraqi forces that inhabit the region. The 64th Brigade Support Battalion maintained a continuous presence on FOB Warhorse near Baqubah during this deployment. Within a month of their return to the US, on 19 January 2007, the division began the task of resetting the equipment, retraining the personnel, and preparing for a return to Iraq in late 2007. The battalion deployed once again to Iraq, serving from December 2007 to January 2009 to Sadr City, Baghdad during the height of sectarian violence and the surge. In March 2010, the battalion deployed alongside the brigade to southern Iraq, in the capacity as an Advise and Assist Brigade, which detailed a small number of senior NCOs and officers, and redeploying during the withdrawal of US Forces from Iraq in 2011. During 2012, 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team sent more than 300 of its officers and senior noncommissioned officers in support of Operation Enduring Freedom; however, the battalion was not directly involved. These 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team Security Forces Assistance Teams deployed on a mission to the southern provinces of Afghanistan to help mentor and train current Afghan National Security Forces, as one of the first brigades in the Army to be given this mission. In February 2015, the 3rd ABCT deployed to Southwest Asia in support of U.S. Central Command. During the nine-month deployment, the unit provided combatant commanders a versatile, responsive, and consistently available force to meet requirements across a range of military operations in the region. These military operations included ongoing operational and contingency operations, operational support and theater security cooperation activities, as well as bilateral and multilateral military exercises that extended over 15 countries throughout the region. From February 2019 to November 2019, the 3rd ABCT deployed to Southwest Asia in support of Operation Spartan Shield and Operation Inherent Resolve; conducting the same aforementioned mission in 2015. = Operation Atlantic Resolve = leftThe 64th Brigade Support Battalion deployed for the fourth time to Europe, but for the first time in the 21st century, in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve from January to November 2017 in response to renewed Russian aggression in eastern Europe.

(c. 1440/1445 ‚Äì 3 October 1513) was the German goldsmith, printer and publisher who printed and published the Nuremberg Chronicle, a landmark of incunabula, and was a successful bookseller of works from other printers. In 1470 he established the first printing house in Nuremberg. Koberger was the godfather of Albrecht D√ºrer, whose family lived on the same street.  Life  Nuremberg Chronicle Anton Koberger was born to an established Nuremberg family of bakers, and makes his first appearance in 1464 in the Nuremberg list of citizens. In 1470 he married Ursula Ingram, the daughter of a well-off tradesman, and after her death he remarried a member of the Nuremberg patriciate, Margarete Holzschuher (1470‚Äì1539), daughter of city councilor Gabriel Holzschuher, in 1491. She was also a cousin of the city councilor Hieronymus Holzschuher who was portrayed by his friend D√ºrer in 1526. In the year before his godson D√ºrer's birth in 1471 he ceased goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher. He quickly became the most successful publisher in Germany,Bartrum, Giulia, Albrecht D√ºrer and his Legacy, British Museum Press, 2002, pp 94-96, absorbing his rivals over the years to become a large capitalist enterprise, with twenty-four presses in operation, printing numerous works simultaneously and employing at its height 100 workers:Walter Gebhardt, \\"N√ºrnberg macht Druck! Von der Medienhochburg zum Printzentrum.\\" in Marion Voigt (ed): Lust auf B√ºcher. N√ºrnberg f√ºr Leser. N√ºrnberg. (2005) pp 11-43. printers, typesetters, typefounders, illuminators, and the like. Constantly improving his business prospects, he sent out traveling agents and established links with booksellers all over Western Europe, including Venice, Europe's other great centre of printing, Milan, Paris, Lyon, Vienna and Budapest. At the supply end, he obtained two papermills. In all he fathered twenty-five children, of whom thirteen survived to adulthood. He probably commissioned the Haller Madonna from D√ºrer, as a gift for his daughter Ursula who had married the young patrician Wolf Haller of the famous Haller von Hallerstein family. Wolf Haller initially entered his father-in-law's business as a helper and traveler, but after a few years he fell out with him and fled to Vienna, where he died in 1505.ADB: Anton Koberger (German biographical lexicon) Koberger's printing house survived his death only until 1526. The many sons turned out to be partly wasteful, partly incapable, and apparently at odds. Some of them continued as goldsmiths and jewelers. The business continued, albeit not as a publisher, only as an assortment. The last known work is a ‚ÄúBohemian Bible‚Äù, printed in 1540 by Melchior Koberger with the publisher Leonhard Milchtaler. Major printed editions Folio Page from \\"The Golden Legend\\" printed by Anton Koberger, 1488. The image depicts a saintly woman being anointed, possibly St. Mary or any number of other female saints. Of Koberger's many different printed editions which he produced from the late 15th century to the early 16th century, three stand out in particular. He printed an illustrated edition of the Bible in High German in 1483, complete with many remarkable woodcut illustrations. The text is from the first German Bible printed by G√ºnther Zainer in the 1470s. Despite popular misconception, Martin Luther's celebrated translation of the Bible into Low German, i.e. Vernacular German, in the early 16th century was not the first German Bible, the Zainer edition appearing nearly 50 years before Luther's, and Koberger's editions of the same translation shortly thereafter. (Legend holds that Luther had approached initially Koberger's printing house to produce his translation of the Bible into German but the printing house declined the project. Scholars have speculated that the Koberger printing house might have continued well beyond 1526 had they accepted the project.) Koberger also printed an edition of the Golden Legend by Jacopp dal Vorgine in German in 1488, also illustrated with woodcuts of saints and religious themes. His most celebrated project is the so-called Nuremberg Chronicle of 1492, or Liber Chronicarum, probably the most extensively illustrated edition of the incunabula period, c. 1450‚Äì1500. Editions were produced in both Latin and German. The work was so popular, it is believed by scholars to have had one of the largest print-runs of the Incunabula Period. Because of the popularity, pirated editions appeared almost immediately after Koberger's edition. A page from the Nuremberg Chronicle, leaf 25 (page 49) printed by Anton Koberger circa 1492. Present day Today, the Anton Koberger Press is a diversified company with interests in printing, luxury retail and watchmaking.

Ryan is also a television game show historian and creator. Ryan was a long-standing staff member of Goodson-Todman Productions and Mark Goodson Productions, where he created the concept for the game show Blockbusters. Ryan also created the rebus puzzles for the game show Classic Concentration. He was also a writer and creator of puzzles for the game shows Body Language, Catch Phrase, Password Plus and Trivia Trap. Lottery games As senior games executive at Goodson's lottery division, Steve created games with million-dollar payoffs for many state and international lottery game shows including: The Big Spin for California, Bingo-Lotto for Lithuania Lottery, Bonus Bonanza for Massachusetts Lottery, A Chance de Ouro for Brazil Lottery, Flamingo Fortune for Florida Lottery, Illinois Luckiest for Illinois Lottery, Instant Riches for Illinois Lottery, New York Wired for New York Lottery, Powerball: The Game Show for Multi-State Lottery, Second Chance Sweepstakes for Ohio Lottery, Telelotto for Estonia Lottery, Win'n Spin for South Africa Lottery, Zama Zama for South Africa Lottery, and 25th Anniversary Game Show for Pennsylvania Lottery.

He began his career as a puzzle columnist at Copley News Service where he created several puzzle and game features for readers across America and other English speaking countries. Those features include ‚ÄúPuzzles & Posers‚Äù which is a mixed grill of cerebral calisthenics designed to explore player's powers of reason, logic and ingenuity, and ‚ÄúZig-Zag‚Äù the original word maze-puzzle which challenges players to search for words from given categories. Both features have run non- stop from 1973 and 1975 (respectively) to current day. Both of Ryan's features have the distinction of being Copley News Service's longest running features in the history of the news organization. Creators Syndicate absorbed both features when Copley News Service sold in 2008. Books Dozens of Steve Ryan books have evolved from his puzzle features and his work in television. Steve self-published his first book in 1975 titled ‚ÄúPuzzle Cards.‚Äù His ‚ÄúGrape Vine‚Äù puzzle in that book is recognized as the earliest known puzzle to utilize what is known as the ‚Äúfreeway rule‚Äù within a genre of puzzles known as mazes-with- rules as referenced in SuperMazes by Robert Abbott. Worldwide, many Steve Ryan puzzle books have been translated and published for Chinese, Russian, Czechoslovakian, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, Indian, Malaysian and Indonesian markets. Ryan is also co-author of The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows, the most comprehensive book of its kind. This encyclopedia is often referred to as the Bible of the game show industry. As a reference book it documents every game show that has ever appeared in a national market whether it be in cable, syndication or network. Three updated editions have been published to date. The book has been used as a Jeopardy! answer: The answer was, \\"'Beat the Odds,' 'Music Bingo' and 'Fast Draw' are entries in an encyclopedia of these by Schwartz, Ryan & Wostbrock.\\" A contestant came in with the correct question, ‚ÄúWhat are game shows?‚Äù Magazines In addition to the books authored by Steve Ryan, his work has appeared in such magazines as Games, Nick, Nickelodeon, Nick Toons and World of Puzzles in the U.S. and Games & Puzzles in the United Kingdom. Will Shortz, while editor at Games magazine, acknowledged the work of Steve Ryan as some of the best in the world of puzzles. Puzzle creations by Steve Ryan have been utilized by the Game's National Puzzle Test. His puzzles always rate as visually intriguing, with a high rate of contestants attempting to solve, yet with a lower than normal rate of success. That's the secret behind most Steve Ryan creations: visually stimulating and mentally captivating. A basic Steve Ryan philosophy has always been to make a puzzle appear easy to solve, yet quite engaging to conjure the solution. Box games Stix & Stones, a box game created by Steve Ryan, received the Parents' Choice 2010 Award for new game. After years of challenging fans to solve his brainteasers with pencils, players are asked to put down those pencils and grab a handful of sticks and stones to create images using the fewest possible number of sticks and stones. It's a game that encourages creative thinking with little or no artistic skill required. Ryan likes to say, ‚ÄúIf you could play against Pablo Picasso, all you‚Äôd have to do is out think him because he has to use the same sticks and stones as you do to create his image.\\" Career As a child, Ryan was inspired by the mathematical recreations of Henry Dudeney and Sam Loyd. Later, while studying Art and Design at California State University Long Beach, Steve polished his skills to illustrate his own puzzle and game creations. And, now, after decades of passionate work, Ryan's word games, number quizzes, problems in logic, devious dissections, scrambled letters, mazes-with-rules, mathematical recreations and more continue to inspire readers to sharpen their pencils and sharpen their wits. Many of his fans know him as the Picasso of Puzzles and Gauguin of Games.

He was capped once for England at under-23 level. As a manager, he took charge of Walsall, Cardiff City and Hednesford Town. He is most known for his time at Wolverhampton Wanderers, for whom he played from 1968 to 1984. Career =Background and Bradford Park Avenue= His older brother Terry was a professional footballer. Kenny Hibbitt started his senior career with his home town club Bradford Park Avenue. He then left for ¬£5,000 in November 1968. =Wolverhampton Wanderers= He joined Wolves debuting as a substitute in a 0‚Äì1 defeat to rivals West Bromwich Albion on 12 April 1969. He did not feature again though until 12 September 1970, when he scored his first of many goals in a 2‚Äì2 draw at Chelsea. During his time at Molineux Hibbitt won the League Cup in 1974 and 1980 scoring in the 1974 final. He played in the 1972 UEFA Cup Final where the club lost narrowly to countrymen Tottenham Hotspur. He also helped the club win two promotions back to the top flight. He finally left Wolves in 1984 on a free transfer. In total, he played 544 games for Wolves, scoring 114 goals; the second most appearances a player has made in Wolves history. In 2011 he was inducted to the Wolverhampton Wanderers 'Hall Of Fame'. =Coventry City= He joined Coventry City in 1984. He spent two seasons at Highfield Road. =Bristol Rovers= He joined Bristol Rovers in 1986. There his playing career came to an abrupt halt in February 1988 when he broke his leg playing against Sunderland. He remained with the Rovers after this as assistant to manager Gerry Francis.

However, Neal's time in charge was brief, departing after only a couple of months to become assistant to Steve Coppell at Manchester City. Hibbitt took over the team once again before handing the reins over to Russell Osman. Osman's period in charge was short however and in December 1996 Hibbitt took over team affairs for the third time, before being replaced by Frank Burrows in February 1998. The arrival of Burrows saw Hibbitt revert to his role as director of Football. His influence was now greatly diminished however, and at the end of the 1997/98 season he left the club altogether. =Later career= He returned to management with non-league Hednesford Town in September 2001. Despite rescuing the club from a poor start and preserving their place in their division, he was dismissed at the end of the season. He now works for the Premier League, reviewing the performances of the referees. He also assists in training local football team Kingswood who play in the Gloucestershire County League.

The pagan Prussians rose against their conquerors, who tried to convert them to Christianity, after Lithuanians and Samogitians soundly defeated the joint forces of the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order in the Battle of Durbe (1260). The first years of the uprising were successful for the Prussians, who defeated the Knights in the Battle of Pokarwis and besieged castles held by the Knights. The Prussians launched raids against the Che≈Çmno Land (Kumerland), where the Knights first established themselves in the late 1220s. The apparent aim of these raids were to force the Knights to devote as many troops in defense of Che≈Çmno as possible so that they could not provide help to the besieged castles and forts. In 1263 the Natangians led by Herkus Monte raided Che≈Çmno Land and took many prisoners. Master Helmrich von Rechenberg, who was at Che≈Çmno at the time, collected his men and pursued the Natangians, who could not move quickly due to a large number of captives. The Teutonic Knights intercepted the Prussians near L√∂bau (now Lubawa, Poland). Their heavy warhorses smashed the Natangian formation, but Herkus Monte with trusted warriors attacked and killed the master Helmrich and marshal Dietrich. Leaderless knights were defeated, and forty knights perished along with a number of low-ranking soldiers. In terms of killed knights, it was the sixth largest defeat of the Teutonic Knights in the 13th century. After the battle it looked like the Prussians might win the uprising, but because of their infighting between numerous clans, they did not seize the opportunity to strike the final devastating blow. Instead individual clans continued to act on their own. References *  External links  *Town of L√∂bau in Prussia on Map of mid 17th century.

The test is manufactured by Oxford Immunotec in the UK. It is available in most European countries, the United States as well as various other countries. It was developed by researchers at the University of Oxford in England.http://www.isis-innovation.com/news/news/oxfordimmunotec-nov02.html  Test overview  T-SPOT.TB counts the number of antimycobacterial effector T cells, white blood cells that produce interferon-gamma, in a sample of blood. This gives an overall measurement of the host immune response against mycobacteria, which can reveal the presence of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Because this does not rely on production of a reliable antibody response or recoverable pathogen, the technique can be used to detect latent tuberculosis. This technique has the advantage that it is comparatively fast (results within 24 hours), and less influenced by previous BCG vaccination compared with the traditional testing method for latent tuberculosis, the tuberculin skin test. This is due to the fact that both tests use different antigens for stimulation. While the tuberculin skin test uses purified protein derivative, a heterogeneous mixture of more than two hundred different mycobacterial peptides, the T-SPOT.TB uses relatively Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens (peptides called ESAT-6 and CFP-10). ESAT-6 and CFP-10 are expressed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but are absent from all currently used BCG vaccines and most nontuberculous mycobacteria. Based on those test principles, it is thought that the T-SPOT.TB is more specific than the tuberculin skin test.  Test performance  In one study in Germany, 70 out of 72 patients with confirmed TB infection were T-SPOT.TB positive, indicating a sensitivity of 97.2%. However, more recent data from a study in children with active TB disease in the UK suggest that the sensitivity of the T-SPOT.TB may in fact be worse than that of the tuberculin skin test (sensitivity reported as 66% and 82%, respectively). The performance of interferon-gamma release assays in children has also been questioned by other publications. A metaanalysis of studies in children with active tuberculosis published in 2011 suggests that the sensitivity of the T-SPOT.TB is very similar to that of the tuberculin skin test (pooled sensitivity reported as 84% and 80%, respectively).

The route was co-signed with other highways along nearly all of its route from Kingman to the border at Nogales. SR 93 was the original designation for the highway from Kingman to Wickenburg, which was built in 1946. In 1965, the northern terminus of the state route was moved south to an unnamed desert junction with U.S. Route 89 just north of Wickenburg, and the southern terminus of U.S. Route 93 was moved south to the US 89 junction. The Arizona Highway Department sought U.S. Highway status for SR 93 across the rest of the state, but the proposal was never granted by AASHTO. On December 17, 1984, the SR 93 designation was removed south of the Grand Avenue/Van Buren Street/7th Avenue intersection in Phoenix. The route was completely decommissioned in 1991. History An early shield used by SR 93. By 1935, the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) had received two extension requests for U.S. Route 93 south of what was then its southern terminus in Glendale, Nevada. Arizona State Highway Engineer T.S. O'Connell requested US 93 extend southwest into California to meet US 99 in El Centro. At a later time, he reconsidered and sent a second request for US 93 multiplex with US 466 over the new Boulder Dam into Arizona and end at US 66 in Kingman. This created a conflict, leading to both proposals being accidentally denied. After a misunderstanding regarding the conflicting proposals from O'Connell, the second proposal was re-evaluated and approved. Thus, US 93 was extended into Arizona. In 1936, the Arizona Highway Department began exploring the possibility of a further extension of US 93. The first extension proposal called for US 93 to end in Phoenix, being extended from Kingman by way of US 66 through Ash Fork. A new US 193 was proposed from Phoenix through Sacaton and Casa Grande to Picacho. At the time, US 89 served the road between Ash Fork and Phoenix, while State Route 87, State Route 187 and State Route 84 ran between Sacaton and Picacho through Casa Grande (of which only SR 87 still traverses today). Welcome sign for Wikieup on former SR 93, now US 93. Upon hearing of the proposed extensions, citizens of Wickenburg, Arizona, Wikieup and Aguila protested to have US 93 run through their towns instead. The protest was considered and the Arizona Highway Department changed its proposal to meet the protester's arguments. The Arizona State Legislature passed a bill instructing the Highway Department to eventually designate and maintain a route for US 93 from Kingman to US 60 via Wikieup once construction work was completed on existing US 93 within the state. The first extension proposal was modified, asking for the US 93 concurrency with US 66 and US 89 to be signed instead as US 93T and for the proposed US 193 to become US 93A. On June 7, 1937, the finalized proposal was submitted to the AASHO, with the US 93T and US 93A suffixes omitted. The proposal was not accepted. Construction for the proposed extension of US 93 was approved on August 21, 1942. On October 11, 1946, the highway between US 89 near Wickenburg and US 66 in Kingman was officially added to the state highway system as State Route 93. The hope was that SR 93 would eventually become the long-awaited extension of US 93 south of Kingman. The early route of SR 93 took a southeast jog to SR 71 and US 89 in Congress. Between 1956 ad 1961, SR 93 was redirected onto a more direct routing to SR 71 southwest of Congress. In 1954, the SR 93 designation was extended south along US 89, US 60, US 70, US 80, SR 87, SR 387 and SR 84 to the United States-Mexico International Border in Nogales. SR 93 now served the cities of Phoenix, Casa Grande and Tucson. In 1958, the Arizona Highway Department proposed for the original section of SR 93 to become an extension of US 93. During the AASHO meeting on June 26, 1958, the request was denied. At the time the proposed alignment of SR 93 between SR 71 and US 89 did not exist and was still in survey planning. This proposed route wasn't officially planned until 1962. The entirety of SR 93 from Kingman to Wickenburg was officially designated the Joshua Forest Parkway in 1963. 1966 Burro Creek Bridge The Arizona Highway Department renewed and modified its earlier extension proposal of US 93 on April 30, 1965. The modified proposal stated the US 93 extension was to take over all of SR 93 between Nogales and Kingman, rather than just the route between Kingman and Wickenburg. During this time, the Burro Creek Bridge had begun construction. The U.S. Route Numbering Committee of the AASHO considered this action on June 28, 1965, but the idea was ultimately denied. According to the AASHO, the route was substandard in many areas, didn't carry nearly enough traffic to justify U.S. Highway status and part of the road had yet to be completed to Wickenburg. Part of the proposal was reconsidered on June 28, 1965, approving an extension of US 93 between Kingman and Wickenburg under the condition that substandard areas of the road were improved quickly. With the extension of US 93, the SR 93 designation was retired north of Wickenburg, but continued to exist between Wickenburg and Nogales. Over time, the route of SR 93 was modernized, being joined by Interstate 10 and Interstate 19. Part of SR 93 between Chandler and Casa Grande was abandoned in 1972 and the route was re-routed onto I-10. In 1984, SR 93 was truncated south of its junction with I-10 BL / SR 85 (Van Buren Street), at the intersection of Grand Avenue and 7th Avenue in Phoenix. The SR 93 designation was finally retired on August 16, 1991. Though never reaching the Mexican border, US 93 was eventually extended further south from US 89 north of Wickenburg. In 1991, the AASHTO approved a request from the Arizona Department of Transportation to eliminate all of US 89 south of Flagstaff. Thus, US 93 was extended to its current southern terminus at US 60 in Wickenburg. Route description At its original northern terminus in Kingman, State Route 93 branched off of U.S. Route 66 (Andy Devine Avenue) at Louise Avenue, which is several miles east of where U.S. Route 93 and U.S. Route 466 branched northwest to Boulder City and Las Vegas. The old two-lane SR 93 headed east, south of and parallel to the new alignment of Interstate 40 until it came to the new section of SR 93 built to connect with the new freeway at DW Ranch Road. (I-40 exit 59). The old road turnoff from the current U.S. 93 alignment is still apparent 4.9 miles (7.9 km) south of the I-40/US 93 interchange. Ghost Ranch Lodge on former SR 84/SR 93 in Tucson. The sign was designed by artist Georgia O'Keeffe. From Wickenburg to the southeast, SR 93 was co-signed with U.S. Routes 60, 70 and 89 to Phoenix, via Grand Avenue. At Grand Ave.'s terminus, located at Van Buren Street and 7th Avenue (Five Points), the quartet of highways picked up U.S. Route 80 from San Diego. On Van Buren Street, the \\"SR 93\\" emblem was at the bottom of the 60-70-80-89-93 totem pole for years (along with Business Loop 10 in the 1970s and '80s). The co-signing continued through Tempe on Mill Avenue and Apache Boulevard, and Mesa's Main Street (but without BL-10, which went south from Phoenix on 44th Street to join Interstate 10 at 48th Street near Broadway Road.). At downtown Mesa's Country Club Drive, SR 93 made a south turn and was co-signed with State Route 87. About five miles (8 km) south of Chandler, SR 87 forked off to the southeast and SR 93 had its own unshared road south about 30 miles (48 km) to Casa Grande. The middle section of this road was abandoned to the Gila River Indian Community in 1973 after it was overlapped by the adjacent Interstate 10 freeway in 1970. The old road continues a bit south of I-10's Casa Blanca Road as a Gila River Indian route, but dead ends at a new canal. The remainder of the road, from the canal to its former junction with what is now SR 387 near exit 185 on Interstate 10, is closed to traffic. The old road can be seen from images on Google Earth or other satellite images. When SR 93 was delisted, the road to Chandler from the south became SR 587 to connect SR 87 south of Chandler with I-10 at Casa Blanca Rd. The southern stub, from I-10 to downtown Casa Grande, was posted SR 387. Grand Avenue border gate in Nogales. Southern terminus of SR 93. Southeast from Casa Grande, SR 93 overlapped State Route 84 to Tucson. SR 84 was later truncated to the Picacho interchange with I-10. SR 84 now terminates in Casa Grande. SR 93 remained co-signed with I-10 from Picacho to Miracle Mile in Tucson, and then was co-signed with Tucson's Business Loop 10 on Miracle Mile (formerly State Route 84A, now the southernmost leg of State Route 77), and then co-signed again with U.S. Routes 80 and 89 (and State Route 789, a strange little highway) down Oracle Road to Drachman Street. In Tucson, the highways zigged three blocks east on Drachman St. to Stone Avenue and then headed south to downtown Tucson under the railroad tracks south to Tucson's Five Points at 17th Street and 6th Avenue. From 17th St., U.S. 80/89 and SR 93/789 extended south on 6th Ave. through South Tucson to the old S. Tucson interchange. Headed south toward Mexico, US 89, SR 93, and SR 789 were co-signed to the Grand Avenue border gate in Nogales. The 1960-era highway exists nearly unchanged from Tucson to Green Valley, east of the new Interstate 19 and in Nogales.

The manga was published by the distributor Tokyopop, and was released on April 24, 2007. It follows Graystripe's adventures trying to escape from the Twolegs, who have taken him in as their kittypet. It is drawn by James Barry. Plot summary The Lost Warrior opens with narration from Graystripe, a warrior who was separated from his Clan, ThunderClan, after being kidnapped by humans trying to deforest his home. He is then taken in as a house cat by a Twoleg (human) family. He somewhat likes the Twolegs and their kits but he cannot stand to be away from his Clan and his fellow warriors. He makes an attempt to flee but gets lost in Twolegplace and battles with a kittypet named Duke. After being forced to flee the fight, Graystripe is led back to the nest he has been staying in by a female kittypet named Millie he meets, who assures him that losing to Duke is nothing to be ashamed of. The two cats get to know each other better and Millie finds a small forest in the middle of the Twolegplace. She then shows it to Graystripe and asks him to teach her how to hunt and fight after learning of his previous life. After a dream in which he is visited by his deceased mate, Silverstream, and his daughter Feathertail, and another fight with Duke and his allies, Graystripe finally makes the decision to try to return to ThunderClan. In another dream about Silverstream, after Graystripe tells Silverstream that he wishes he could be with her, Silverstream reminds him that his place is with ThunderClan. She also tells him that he already has a traveling companion. Later, Graystripe asks Millie to come with him to ThunderClan, and is taken aback at her refusal. He then leaves for ThunderClan alone. Graystripe ends up getting lost in Twolegplace for days before collapsing from exhaustion. Millie changes her mind and goes out to catch up to Graystripe. Upon meeting him, she discovers him feverish and weak; he even calls her by Silverstream's name. Millie nurses him back to health and asks him about Silverstream. Then the two set off to try to find ThunderClan. What they don't realize is that ThunderClan, along with the rest of the Clans, no longer resides in the forest. Characters * Graystripe ‚Äì the main character, a kidnapped warrior of ThunderClan. During the events of Dawn, he was captured by Twolegs, and adopted by a loving family. Unfamiliar with the ways of Twolegplace, and his memories of wild life fast fading, Graystripe almost sinks into despair, but Millie helps him, and he trains her as a warrior, recalling his own love of the wild. At the end of this book, he and Millie are seen setting off on a long journey, determined to reach the Clans, no matter what it takes. * Millie ‚Äì a former kittypet (house cat). She meets Graystripe in Twolegplace and helps him in many ways physically and emotionally. She chooses to come with him on his quest, and proves her tenacity and courage many times during the trilogy. A useful (and possibly unique) trait of Millie's is the ability to speak dog, which she uses to great effect in Warrior's Refuge. In the Power of Three series, this skill is never mentioned, but Lionblaze notes that Millie is extremely good at fighting dogs. *Duke and his friends ‚Äì a trio of strong and territorial kittypets. They battle and beat Graystripe when he first arrives, but by the end of the book, the combined efforts of a strengthened Graystripe and newly trained Millie is enough to fight them off. Ironically, as Duke leaves in shame, he hypocritically calls Graystripe 'savage', but Graystripe, remembering what it means to be a warrior, does not listen to him, and walks proudly away with his 'apprentice', Millie. Duke and his cronies are not seen for the rest of the manga series. Critical Reaction The Lost Warrior was praised by Publishers Weekly, which felt that \\"Many little (and perhaps some larger) girls will find this kitty fantasy irresistible\\". School Library Journal praised how \\"the \\"manga inspired\\" artwork and panels work well with the story. The format allows Graystripe's imagination and emotions to be expressed\\". The reviewer felt that the book was too short and had little action. Leroy Douresseaux praised both the writing and artwork of the book: \\"Writer Dan Jolley hits the ground running, showing the chops of a veteran comic book writer by concisely and quickly bringing the reader into Erin Hunter‚Äôs world of Warriors....Artist James Barry draws in a manner that is similar to animated films.\\"  Publication list  * The Lost Warrior (EN), HarperCollins (paperback), 24 April 2007 * The Lost Warrior (EN), HarperCollins (paperback alternate), 2007 * The Lost Warrior (EN), HarperCollins (paperback, import), 2008 * The Lost Warrior (EN), HarperCollins (library binding), 1 May 2007 * The Lost Warrior (EN), HarperCollins (library binding), September 2007 * Der verlorene Krieger (DE), Tokyopop (paperback), 2008 * Ztracen√Ω v√°leƒçn√≠k (CZ), Zonerpress (paperback), 2008 * Kadonnut soturi (FI), Pauna Media Group (paperpack), 2009 * –ü—Ä–æ–ø–∞–≤—à–∏–π –≤–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å (RU), Tokyopop (paperback), 14 October 2010 * Graustreif und Millie (DE), Tokyopop (paperback), 14 October 2010 * The Lost Warrior (EN), HarperCollins (full color reprint), 8 August 2017 References Category:2006 American novels Category:American fantasy novels Category:Tokyopop titles Category:Warriors (novel series) Category:HarperCollins books Category:2006 children's books Category:Books about cats Category:Comics about cats Category:Original English-language manga ","title":"The Lost Warrior (manga)"},{"id":"11560762","title":"1902 St. Louis Cardinals season"},{"id":"11560774","text":"Donald Elroy Boll (July 16, 1927 - December 29, 2001) was an American football offensive lineman in the National Football League for the Washington Redskins and the New York Giants.

Wellman entered minor league baseball as a player in and began coaching in . Wellman attended Sam Houston State University and Southwestern University. Managerial career Wellman began his coaching career with the 1988 Pulaski Braves. He was a coach in the Atlanta Braves system from 1988 to 1991, including 1990 with the Burlington Braves and 1991 with the Durham Bulls. Wellman managed outside of the Braves organization from 1992‚Äì2003, with the exception of 2000, when he was a coach for the minor league Louisville RiverBats. He returned to the Braves as the hitting coach for the Greenville Braves in 2004-2005, and the Mississippi Braves in 2006. Wellman was the skipper of Mississippi from 2007-2010. After the Mississippi Braves finished the 2010 season with a 63-74 record, Wellman's contract was not renewed. He joined the Springfield Cardinals of the Texas League, Double-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals, as hitting coach, and served three years (2011‚Äì2013) in that post before his appointment as manager of the Travelers, who also play in the Texas League.

He protested the umpire throwing his pitcher out of the game for using a foreign substance by covering home plate with dirt, then tracing in the dirt a new, significantly larger home plate. He then went on to uproot bases and throw them, crawl in a prone position across the infield like a soldier, and pretend to bite and hurl the rosin bag at an umpire as if it were a hand grenade. He concluded his tirade by pretending to eject the umpires themselves with a fist-pump and then blowing a farewell kiss to the crowd while taking a bow. The episode was broadcast on sports shows across the United States and gained him widespread fame on the Internet. Wellman was given a three-game suspension effective June 4, 2007. The Braves reappointed Wellman manager of the Mississippi Braves on December 7, 2007. In March 2009, ESPN showed the top-10 meltdowns in sports history and judged Wellman's to be #1. Upon showing the clip, Hannah Storm said ‚Äúand there he goes, never to be seen from again.‚Äù Co-anchor Josh Elliott added ‚Äúend of his career.‚Äù However, this was incorrect. He was still the manager and on September 13, 2008 he led the Mississippi Braves to the Southern League championship beating the Carolina Mudcats 3-2 in the 10th inning of the decisive Game 5. He was also brought up to the major league Atlanta Braves team for a couple of weeks in September 2008, tradition for top minor league managers in the Braves organization. On May 26, 2016 in a game against the Northwest Arkansas Naturals he was ejected after protesting a runner called out. Before being ejected he stood in what appeared to be a military parade rest position, before throwing the rosin bag as a grenade. Upon being ejected by the umpire he first kicked the second base then pulled the base from the ground and walked away with it.

Pelican was laid down 10 November 1917 at Gas Engine and Power Co., Morris Heights, New York; launched 12 June 1918; sponsored by Miss E. B. Patterson; and commissioned 10 October 1918, Lt. (j.g.) G. E. McHugh, USNR, in command.  World War I mine clearance operations  Upon completion of fitting out, she sailed for Scotland on 6 April 1919, to assist in the sweeping of the North Sea Mine Barrage. Arriving 20 April, she and other minesweepers immediately went to work in sweeping mines. = 9 July 1919 incident = During this service Pelican's naval career almost ended when it had hardly begun. While sweeping several mines, one of them exploded underneath her hull causing her to take on a great amount of water and slowly settle by the head. Despite heavy seas, and threat of imminent sinking, Pelican's crew, with the assistance of two of her sister ships, and after 19 hours of effort, managed to bring the badly damaged vessel into port at Scapa Flow for temporary repairs. The 9th of July, however, proved a momentous day. Exploding mines damaged three minesweepers, the tug Patuxent, and a subchaser. Again sweeping in company with , shuddered under the impact of an explosion at 0925 that, in turn, countermined another mine 25 yards off her starboard bow; in a chain reaction, a third explosion (probably caused by the second) rolled the sea 30 yards astern, carrying away the sweep and resulting in the loss of a \\"kite\\" and 70 fathoms of precious wire as well. But all these mishaps proved but a preliminary to what transpired soon thereafter. At 1000, an upper level mine exploded beneath Pelican, which in turn triggered five simultaneous countermines around her. The little ship disappeared in a veritable cloud of spray that, when it subsided, revealed Pelican- heavily hit, battered, and holed-assuming a list before beginning to settle. As the seemingly mortally wounded minesweeper wallowed in the swells, Auk, immediately altered course to close Pelican. Passing a line at 1008, within 10 minutes of the explosions, Auk drew alongside Pelican. After seeing one hose line part, Auk passed another to aid Pelican in pumping out the rapidly rising water below decks. However, the rough seas repeatedly slammed the ships together, damaging lines and hoses, and forcing their replacement. At 1054, passed a towline and began moving ahead with the crippled Pelican, in turn tethered to Auk, astern. Eider fell in with the group as it labored ahead, securing to Pelican's starboard side, Eider and Auk acting much in the fashion of waterwings, keeping their sister ship afloat between them. Difficulties soon arose, however, as the ships struggled toward the Orkneys. A head sea sprang up, tossing the minecraft about and straining moorings and hose lines. Pump lines carried away and, soon thereafter-shorn of the means for keeping her afloat-Pelican began to settle further by the bow. The pressure of the water in the flooded forward compartments in the damaged ship now buckled and distorted the forward fireroom bulkhead-the only barrier between Pelican and the sea. At 2300, Capt. Bulmer of Auk ordered most of Pelican's crew transferred to Eider. A dozen volunteers chosen from the crew (all had stepped forward when asked to hazard staying on board)all that was absolutely necessary \\"to care for the ship\\"-remained on board Pelican. Gradually, however, the pumps of Auk and Eider, working full capacity after the lines had been repaired and again placed in operation, succeeded in lowering Pelican's, waterline. The battle to keep Pelican afloat continued on into the night and into the predawn darkness, men standing by with axes to chop through the mooring lines should Pelican give any indication of imminent sinking. Finally, on the morning of 10 July 1919, the flotilla limped into Tresness Bay where Auk's pumps continued to help lower Pelican's waterline even further. Fully repaired at Newcastle-on-Tyne, Pelican departed for home, arriving at New York on 6 December 1919. Pelican next transferred to the Pacific Fleet and operated out of Pearl Harbor, until decommissioned there 3 May 1922.  Recommissioning for World War II  Recommissioned 17 August, she performed miscellaneous tasks, such as survey work and photography missions, while attached to Naval Air Station, Pearl Harbor. Reclassified AVP-6 on 22 January 1936, Pelican was assigned to Commander, Aircraft, Scouting Force for further duty. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor found Pelican on the West Coast. With the beginning of war, the sturdy little vessel commenced tending aircraft and serving as convoy escort, until May 1943, when she joined the Atlantic Fleet.  Transfer to the Atlantic Fleet  She alternated tending seaplanes and serving as convoy escort, performing an un-glamorous but vital part of the war effort. Reporting to the Fleet Sound School in March 1945, Pelican assisted in experiments with new ASW gear until October, when she arrived at Charleston Navy Yard.  Decommissioning  Decommissioned 30 November, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 19 December. She was sold for scrap in November 1946.

It is the sequel to his 1959 novel, The Hustler. Plot The novel is set twenty years after The Hustler. Fast Eddie now runs a pool hall of his own. After seeing a lookalike of Minnesota Fats on the television, he decides to go in search of the real one, whom he finds in the Florida Keys. Eddie persuades Fats to go on a national tour. He meets Arabella, an English woman, who moves in with him. The finale is set at Lake Tahoe, where Eddie manages to best a number of younger players. Television is a major subplot. At the beginning, Eddie watches most of his pool on the television, and tends to play the game by himself. Film adaptation The novel was adapted into a 1986 drama film directed by Martin Scorsese from a screenplay by Richard Price, based on the novel.

As if this isn't enough to cope with, Banks finds his freedom hampered by the politically motivated appointment of an old enemy, Detective Superintendent Richard \\"Dirty Dick\\" Burgess, to head the investigation. Finally, warned off the case, the only way Banks can salvage his career is by beating Burgess to the killer.

It lies on the Oder-Havel Canal near Niederfinow in Brandenburg. The lift overcomes a difference in elevation of 36 metres.  History  Aerial Photo Picture from inside the lift structure On 17 June 1914 the large navigation between Berlin and Stettin was opened. Near Niederfinow the difference in elevation was overcome using a staircase lock with four chambers. One can still visit the remains of these locks today (seen in the foreground of the accompanying aerial photograph). The capacity of the staircase locks was quickly exceeded, therefore, between 1927 and 1934, the boat lift was built and inaugurated on 21 March 1934. The lift is 60 m high, the length 94 m, taking five minutes for the trough to move through the 36m elevation difference. The following enterprises were involved: { Foundations * Beton- und Monierbau AG, Berlin * Christoph & Unmack GmbH, Berlin * Philipp Holzmann AG, Berlin Steel structure * August Kl√∂nne, Dortmund * J.

Krupp Grusonwerk, Magdeburg Electrical system * Siemens-Schuckert werk, Berlin * Allgemeine Electrizit√§ts-Gesellschaft, Berlin Foundations and steel structure of the aqueduct * Beuchelt & Co, Gr√ºnberg } By 26 January 1939 100,000 boats had already passed through the lift. In the inaugural year there was 2,832,000 tonnes of traffic. The lift was the subject of a general overhaul in 1980 and the lifting cables were renewed in 1984/85. Today the boat lift is too short for some barge trains which must be separated to pass the lift. The lift is running near to its capacity with about 11,000 boats passing through each year,Das Original, Berliner Zeitung, 16 October 2006 in German so in 1997 the decision was made to build a new, bigger lift. The Niederfinow lift is a popular tourist destination with about 500,000 visitors per year. Due to this a new larger car park was opened in 2003.  Technology  Information plaque Steel construction of the upper aqueduct The trough counterweights The boat lift consists of 14,000 Tonnes of riveted structural steelwork standing on steel columns. The Oder-Havel-Kanal approaches the head of the lift on a 4,000 Tonne riveted steelwork aqueduct. The trough when filled weighs 4,290 tonnes and hangs on 256 steel cables, these cross over guide rollers and support 192 counterweights which balance the trough. The security of the lift is maintained by keeping half the cables in tension and the other half relaxed in reserve. The guide rollers have a diameter of 3.5m. Pin gearing with D.C.motors in Leonards electric motor speed controllers, connected together by a shaft allow a symmetrical drive. This arrangement allows the exact synchronisation of the four pin gears. The four Leonard controllers each have an output of 55 kilowatts totalling 220 kilowatts. Four worm geared shafts are driven which intersect with internal threads built into the troughs. These move freely under normal circumstances but would seize if a cable broke providing extra safety. Planning for the new boat lift Because of the continuing increase in traffic on the Oder-Havel-Kanal, in 1997 it was decided that a new, bigger lift should be built next to the present one In the autumn of 2006 earthworks began between the lift and the old staircase locks. The new lift, which is being built by Bilfinger BergerGerman Ship Lift Rebuilt as Stimulus Floods Waterways and the site is being developed in partnership with Johann Bunte, is due to be finished in 2021Probebetrieb f√ºr Schiffshebewerk Eberswalde verz√∂gert.

The monastery, which is now a major teaching and retreat center of the Southern Drukpa Lineage of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, is located at the northern end of the Thimphu Valley about from the capital. It sits on a hill above the end of the road at Dodeyna and it takes about an hour to walk up the steep hill to reach the monastery from there. According to Bhutanese religious histories, the place was first visited by Padmasambhava in the 8th century. In the 13th century it was visited by Phajo Drugom Zhigpo the Tibetan Lama who first established the Drukpa Kagyu tradition in Bhutan. Johnsingh (2005) describes the beauty of the place and the occurrence of goral there. Chagri Monastery, Bhutan Chagri Dorjeden was the first monastery established in Bhutan by Ngawang Namgyal in 1620 when he was 27 years old. The Zhabdrung spent three years in strict retreat at Chagri and resided there for many periods throughout the rest of his life. It was at Chagri in 1623 that he established the first Drukpa monastic order in Bhutan. In 1705, the 7th Druk Desi, Umze Peljor, retired to Chagri Monastery, where he lived until his death in 1707.

Other Jewish graves are found nearby as part of the Common Burying Ground and Island Cemetery on Farewell Street. History The cemetery was founded in 1677 or possibly earlier. In the Newport land records, a deed was recorded on 28 Feb 1677 for a certain parcel of land, 30 feet square, sold by Nathaniel Dickens to Mordecai Campannall and Moses Packechoe for a burial-place for the Jews of Newport, and this purchase may have been an addition to a cemetery that was already in existence as of that date.Kohler, Max J. \\"The Jews of Newport\\", Publications of the American Jewish Historical Society, Issue No. 6 (1897), p. 68 The synagogue is the oldest surviving synagogue building in the United States, and the cemetery is the second oldest Jewish cemetery in the country. The cemetery gates are decorated with torches turned to face downward, an acknowledgement of the ending of life's flame. Prior to the establishment of Temple Ohabei Shalom Cemetery in Boston in 1844, Jews from Massachusetts were sent to the Touro Synagogue Cemetery, the West Indies, or Europe for burial in sacred ground. Judah Touro, a philanthropist who was born and reared in Newport, contributed $40,000, an immense sum at the time, to the Jewish cemetery at Newport. This funded the restoration and maintenance of the cemetery. He is buried in the Jewish cemetery of Newport. The inscription on his tombstone reads: \\"To the Memory of / Judah Touro / He inscribed it in the Book of / Philanthropy / To be remembered forever.\\"Fleming, p. 31. The cemetery's Egyptian revival gate and fence were designed by Boston architect Isaiah Rogers (1810‚Äì49) who designed an identical gate for Boston's Old Granary Burying Ground.James Stevens Curl, The Egyptian Revival, Routledge, 2005, p, 300 By the mid-19th century, the maritime prosperity that built Newport's fine colonial churches, synagogue, public buildings and homes had vanished when the port of Providence superseded Newport after the British destroyed Newport's wharves during the American Revolution. The great mansions of Newport in the Gilded Age were still in the future. Newport in the 1850s was an old seaport town whose air of genteel decay and cool sea breezes had recently begun to attract members of Boston's intellectual elite as a summer retreat. There were virtually no Jews in Newport in this period; the synagogue was shuttered. American writer Henry Wadsworth Longfellow visited the area in July 1852 and showed an interest more in the cemetery than in the synagogue, which he described as being \\"a shady nook, at the corner of two dusty, frequented streets\\".Einboden, Jeffrey. Nineteenth-Century US Literature in Middle Eastern Languages. Edinburgh University Press, 2013: 21. Longfellow was inspired to write his poem \\"The Jewish Cemetery at Newport\\" during this visit. Longfellow, a scholar who knew Hebrew, begins his poem by expressing his surprise at coming upon a synagogue in an old New England port town, due to the dearth of Jews in New England during that time and the Colonial era. The American Jewish poet Emma Lazarus wrote a sort of redux of Longfellow's poem in 1867 JWA - Emma Lazarus - Early Jewish Themes titled, \\"In the Jewish Synagogue at Newport\\". Some interpreters contend that Lazarus intended with her poem to let Longfellow know that the Jews might be down, but that they were not dead. However, this interpretation matches neither the mournful tone nor the explicit references to the defunct nature of the Newport synagogue, such as \\"no signs of life\\", and the general reference to Hebrew as \\"a language dead\\", not to mention the concluding line referring to \\"the mystery of death\\". In this latter interpretation, Lazarus was concurring with Longfellow regarding the sanctity of Jewish memory while acknowledging the unlikelihood of a Jewish national revival, which really only blossomed in the decade following the deaths of Longfellow and Lazarus.

It runs from the New Hampshire state line, continuing there as New Hampshire Route 18 northward to U.S. Route 2 (US 2) in the town of St. Johnsbury. The route parallels and connects to Interstate 93 (I-93) and is a former routing of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway. Route description Vermont Route 18 begins at the New Hampshire state line between Littleton and Waterford. After crossing the Connecticut River into Vermont, VT 18 veers westward to cross under I-93 into Lower Waterford village. VT 18 then continues northwest running closely parallel to I-93 on its west side for roughly until Stiles Pond. Just north of the pond, I-93 changes direction from northwest to southwest. VT 18 crosses under I-93 at this point with an interchange at Exit 1 (the only numbered exit on I-93 in Vermont). Soon after the I-93 junction, VT 18 ends at U.S. Route 2 about past the St. Johnsbury town line. US 2 continues into the town center. VT 18 is part of the Connecticut River Byway.

CFP-10 is a 10 kDa secreted antigen from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It forms a 1:1 heterodimeric complex with ESAT-6. Both genes are expressed from the RD1 region of the bacterial genome and play a key role in the virulence of the infection.  Function  10-kDa culture filtrate protein (CFP-10) is an antigen that contributes to the virulence Mycobacterium tuberculosis. CFP-10 forms a tight 1:1 heterodimeric complex with 6kDaA early secreted antigen target (ESAT-6). In the mycobacterial cell, these two proteins are interdependent on each other for stability. The ESAT-6/CFP-10 complex is secreted by the ESX-1 secretion system, also known as the RD1 region. Mycobacterium tuberculosis uses this ESX-1 secretion system to deliver virulence factors into host macrophage and monocyte white blood cells during infection. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the core components of the whole ESX-1 secretion system include Rv3877, and two AAA ATPases, including Rv3870 and Rv3871, a cytosolic protein. The ESAT-6/CFP-10 heterodimer complex is targeted for secretion by a C-terminal signal sequence on CFP-10 that is recognized by the cytosolic Rv3871 protein. Rv3871 then interacts with the CFP-10 C-terminal, and escorts the ESAT-6/CFP-10 complex to Rv3870 and Rv3877, a multi-transmembrane protein which makes up the pore that spans the cytosolic membrane of the virulent host cell. Once ESAT-6/CFP-10 is next to the membrane of the virulent host cell, the CFP-10 C-terminal attaches and binds itself to the cells surface. The ESAT-6/CFP-10 complex‚Äôs secretion and attachment to the virulent host cell shows its contribution to the pathogenicity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. [4].  Structure  The 10-kDa culture filtrate protein (CFP-10) and 6kDaA early secreted antigen target (ESAT-6) complex is a 100 amino-acid sequence protein. ESAT-6/CFP-10 has a hydrophobic nature as well as a high content of Œ±-helical structures. Resonance structure analysis of the complex reveals two similar helix-turn-helix hairpin structures formed by the individual proteins, which lie anti-parallel to each other and forms a four-helix bundle. Its long flexible arm projecting off the four-helix bundle, formed by the seven amino-acid C-terminal of CFP-10, is essential for binding and attaching to the surface of host white blood cells; such as macrophages and monocytes. If this C-terminus is cleaved off, the complex shows greatly reduced attachment ability.

In the United States only citizens have ever been able to vote, and in 1964 only literate citizens could vote, so it was legal to ensure that (1) a potential voter was literate, and (2) a potential voter was a United States Citizen. Through the employment of literacy tests, oral demands to interpret the United States Constitution and detailed questions about a potential voter's origins and how long the potential voter had been in the United States, Republican workers would challenge minority voters, especially those with broken English. William Rehnquist, later chief justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, is said to have been the head of a group of lawyers hoping to challenge voters in minority Democratic precincts. Operation Eagle Eye was a two-year effort, and the laws in Arizona have since made this kind of challenge illegal.  Precursors (1954‚Äì1962)  Beginning in the early 1950s and 60s, it became popular for politicians to appeal to Southern whites through racially charged campaign messages. > \\"Many succeeding Republican candidates and almost all Republican presidents > made racial appeals ‚Äì some subtle, some otherwise ‚Äì to southern whites still > angry at federal abolition of the Jim Crow system. This became known as the > ‚ÄòSouthern Strategy‚Äô\\". Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson‚Äôs overwhelming popularity in the polls at the time ‚Äì just a year in after taking office in the aftermath of Kennedy‚Äôs assassination ‚Äì and his relentless talk of civil rights and voting rights heightened Republican National Committee concerns and swung the door wide open for voter suppression strategies of all kinds. It was in this context that the infamous Operation Eagle Eye was born. As shameful and un-American as it was, RNC‚Äôs goal was simple ‚Äì to develop a strategy around voter suppression to win elections ‚Äì and it has been effective. Many now believe that the 1958 ballot security program implemented in Arizona was the precursor to Operation Eagle Eye and the blueprint for which it was designed.  Launch (1964)  The Republican National Committee announced its plan to conduct a nationwide ballot security program entitled \\"Operation Eagle Eye\\" in 1964. It was to be employed in the presidential election between Barry Goldwater and President Lyndon B. Johnson. At the time, Operation Eagle Eye was virtually unknown but a highly organized and financed effort by the Republican party to suppress minority voting. The RNC insisted it was necessary to protect the integrity of the American ballot and against voter fraud. \\"OEE\\" became the nation's first large-scale anti-voter fraud campaign where the Republican National Committee recruited tens of thousands of volunteers to show up at polling places, mostly in inner-cities, to challenge voter eligibility. In particular, whether the voter was able to read since literacy was a requirement to vote. The recruited poll watchers used a variety of tactics, including asking voters to read a portion of the Constitution, cameras, two-way radios, and calls to Republican- friendly sheriffs. This attempt to thwart electoral fraud by challenging voters at the polls only served to intimidate minorities and swing elections in favor of Republicans. Future Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist was a prominent figure during the years of Operation Eagle Eye. He was a poll watcher with direct involvement in challenging voters at the polls as early as 1958. Years later during Rehnquist's Senate confirmation hearings to become Chief Justice, a US District Attorney in Phoenix at the time testified that he had seen Rehnquist challenging black and hispanic voters at precincts in South Phoenix. Rehnquist denied any such involvement. However, his association with OEE remained a stain on his reputation despite being confirmed as Chief Justice in 1986. Another key figure in Operation Eagle Eye was Charles Barr, its National Director. He was responsible for employing \\"100,000 poll-watchers with the objective of challenging over a million voters\\", however, he denied any discriminatory practices. =1964 ballot security program initiatives= The General Outline of the 1964 Ballot Security Program included the following instructions: * Create in each state an effective Ballot Security Organization under leadership of the State Ballot Security Officer. * Research and study State Election Laws, irregularities and errors, and how to combat and correct. * Attend national educational conferences for Ballot Security Officers. * Observe and report pre-election violations. * Recruit and train poll watchers and challengers, where permitted, to secure each precinct. * Appoint qualified and true Republicans as election officials in each precinct. Determine that registration is being properly conducted. * Strive to improve canvassing methods to identify unqualified, non-existent voters and eliminate them from the lists. * Plan, schedule, supervise and teach training courses designed to eliminate fraud and error for Republican election officials, watchers, and challengers. * Prepare and distribute materials and check lists for study and reference by precinct officials. * Focus press attention on the problem and program. * Secure effective cooperation of law enforcement officials. * Set up an Election Day security network to advise and act on ballot irregularity matters. * Collect information in the event of prosecution or other proceedings following an election. * Determine that ballots and machines are safeguarded after the election. * Develop new plans and ideas to improve future operations by Ballot Security Officers, considering possible legislative amendments to improve the election laws for future elections. = Operation = # Purging voter lists through vote caging: Typically a method of purging voters lists, voter caging consists of sending mail to addresses on the voter registration polls and counting the number of returned or undelivered pieces of mail. This becomes the basis for purging the voter list. This is unreliable because mail can be returned for any number of reasons. However, in 1964, Eagle Eye supporters challenged 1.8 million voters' eligibility with this tactic. # Distribution of deterrent paraphernalia: Eagle Eye supporters also sent misleading or deceptive mailers to the voter lists. Some examples of this voter intimidation were mailers indicating a voter who had committed a traffic violation, etc. would be arrested after voting, or anonymous calls to minority voters telling them they would be harassed at the polls. The most offensive was encouraging minority voters to write-in Dr. Martin Luther King's name for president knowing this would nullify their votes. # Deployment of poll watchers to challenge voters on Election Day: Challenging voters at the polls could happen in a number of ways. They could be asked humiliating questions, demanded to show citizenship papers, or asked to show proof they could read. Voters were challenged if they appeared on the purged voters list. Psychological deterrence was a significant aspect of the OEE efforts. The Republican strategy attempted to discourage illegitimate voters from committing fraud by simply creating the appearance that they were being watched. It was for this reason that RNC leaders also encouraged poll watchers to bring cameras.  Political legacy (1970s‚Äìpresent)  In 1964, the Republican, Barry Goldwater suffered a stunning defeat. And although President Johnson won the election by a wide margin, out of Operation Eagle Eye emerged a frightening concept: > \\"Some of the methods employed by Eagle Eye became part of the modus operandi > of subsequent Republican campaigns. These include challenging of Democratic > voters at polls without cause, humiliation of uneducated voters, efforts to > slow down voting in Democratic precincts, special targeting of minority, > low-income neighborhoods for challenges and developing an attitude among > ballot security teams that encourages stereotyping low-income and minority > voters as venal and stupid.\\" After Operation Eagle Eye, literacy tests were challenged by the state of Arizona and the federal government instituted a ban on the requirement.

History Pelican was laid down as YMS-441 on 27 November 1943 by Robert Jacob Inc. of City Island, New York; launched 13 November 1944; and commissioned 21 February 1945, Lt. Pierre LaTour, USNR, in command. After shakedown on the east coast, YMS-441 sailed for the Pacific 10 April, finally arriving at Okinawa in August. While there, she participated in minesweeping exercises and in several minesweeping operations with the U.S. 3rd Fleet. Returning to the United States in February 1946, YMS-441 operated along the California coast until November, when she sailed to Guam. Arriving in Guam in January 1947, YMS-441 swept for mines in the Caroline and Marshall islands. While at Guam, YMS-441 was named USS Pelican and classified AMS-32 on 18 February. Sailing for Pearl Harbor in late September, Pelican arrived in October and immediately entered the yards to be outfitted as an experimental ship for the Eniwetok atomic bomb tests. All her minesweeping gear was removed and special electronic gear was installed. Based in the Eniwetok Atoll area, she supported the test in the first half of 1948. After returning to Pearl Harbor in June 1948, the electronic gear was removed and her minesweeping gear was replaced. Pelican remained in the Hawaiian Islands area for the next two years of her service. At the start of the Korean War, USS Pelican deployed to Korea. In October 1950, Pelican was part of a group consisting of , , , , , , , , four Republic of Korea minesweepers, and a helicopter from that cleared the heavily mined port of Chinnampo in less than two weeks. She remained in the Far East until 1955. On 7 February, she was reclassified MSC(O)-32 and on 16 April of that year, she was loaned to Japan, becoming Ogishima (MSC-659). Returned to the U.S. Navy in April 1968, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 May 1968.

(26 March 1878 ‚Äì 4 April 1971) was a British economic historian who specialised in the medieval period. He was born in Brighton in 1878, the son of Dr. F. W. Salzmann, and educated at Haileybury College and Pembroke College, Cambridge. He studied natural sciences, aiming to make a career in medicine; however, after inheriting a small private income, he gave this up to work in history. He married Maud Russell in 1904, and had two sons and two daughters. He did not serve in the First World War, through ill-health; he taught at St. George's School, Harpenden from 1916 to 1918. In 1918 he moved to Cambridge, and there tutored students. In 1934, his marriage to Maud was dissolved, and he moved to London, shortly thereafter moving to Lewes in Sussex, where he lived to his death. His first book, The History of the Parish of Hailsham, was published in 1901. He then began his work in economic history, writing on Sussex industries for the Victoria County History. In 1913 he published English Industries of the Middle Ages, and in 1931 English Trade in the Middle Ages. The building industry had been omitted from English Industries, though it was touched on in an enlarged edition ten years later, and in 1952 he produced A Documentary History of Building in England Down to 1540, a comprehensive study of both the practical and organisational aspects of the industry. In 1934 Salzman succeeded W.H. Page as general editor of the Victoria County History. He held the post until 1949, overseeing the production of fifteen volumes, covering Oxfordshire and Warwickshire as well as Sussex, and was succeeded by Ralph Pugh. Salzman's other academic works included biographies of Henry II (1914) and Edward I (1968), as well as the general studies English Life in the Middle Ages (1926), England in Tudor Times (1926), and A Survey of English History (1930). He wrote a pair of popular collections ‚Äì Medieval Byways (1913) and More Medieval Byways (1926) ‚Äì of short essays on individual topics, \\"cookery\\" or \\"memories\\", built around extracts from contemporary records and providing an insight into medieval life seen from an unusual angle. In 1926 he published a play, The Girdle of Venus. In 1909 he became the honorary editor of the Sussex Archaeological Society, a post he would hold for the next fifty years. He was president of the society from 1954 to 1956, and published a history of it in 1946. In 1955, he was appointed as a Commander of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, and in 1965 awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Sussex.

The series of events concern the following districts: *Skvira, June 23, 1919: a pogrom in which 45 Jews were massacred, many were severely wounded, and 35 Jewish women were raped by army insurgents. *Justingrad, August, 1919: where a pogrom made its way through the shtetl with an unspecified number of Jewish men murdered and Jewish women raped. *Ivankiv Kiev district, 18‚Äì20 October 1919. In the pogrom carried out by Cossack and Volunteer Army troops, 14 Jews were massacred, 9 wounded, and 15 Jewish women and girls were raped by units under the command of Struk in three days of carnage.Harry James Cargas, Reflections of a Post-Auschwitz Christian. On meeting Kurt Waldheim. Pg. 136 Immediate reactions The leaders of the White Army issued orders condemning the pogroms, but these were largely unheeded due to widespread anti- Semitism.Benjamin Frankel, A Restless Mind: Essays in Honor of Amos Perlmutter. Published by Routledge, pg. 272 Lenin had spoken out against pogroms in March, and in June, the Bolsheviks assigned some funds for victims of pogroms. However, the events received little coverage in the Bolshevik press. Escalation of hostility The Kiev pogroms of 1919 proved the first of many such events.Zvi Y. Gitelman, A Century of Ambivalence: The Jews of Russia and the Soviet Union, 1881 to the Present. Pg. 65-70. Indiana University Press, 2001. . There were a total of 1,326 pogroms across Ukraine around that time, in which between 30,000 and 70,000 Jews were massacred. The pogroms were marked by utmost cruelty and face-to-face brutality. Thousands of women were raped. Hundreds of shtetlekh were pillaged, and Jewish neighborhoods were left in ruins. According to some estimates, overall, in the pogroms of 1918-1921, half a million Jews were left homeless.Sharman Kadish, Bolsheviks and British Jews: The Anglo-Jewish Community, Britain, and the Russian Revolution. Published by Routledge, pg. 87 Of these 53.7% were committed by Petlura's Ukrainian nationalists, the remainder by troops from White Volunteer Army (17%), the Bolsheviks' Red Army (2.3%), or local bands. These estimates include deaths due to massacre-induced disease or starvation. More recent estimates based on newly available Russian records judge the percentage killed by the White Volunteer Army to be much higher, perhaps as high as 50 percent.\\"Manus I. Midlarsky, The Killing Trap: genocide in the twentieth century. Published by Cambridge University Press. Page 45  Background and causes The Kiev Pogroms of 1919 were splurges of looting, raping, and murder chiefly directed against the shops, factories, homes, and persons of the Jews.William C. Fuller, The Foe Within: Fantasies of Treason and the End of Imperial Russia, 2006 Ukraine had the largest concentration of Jews in Russia (part of the Russian organized Pale of Settlement) at the time and was also the scene of the bitterest and most prolonged fighting between Jews and non-Jews. This is important because according to research there is a positive correlation on a broad scale between the number of Jews, in a given place, and an increased likelihood of pogroms, and they become more likely when long-term subordination and superordination of social groups is in dispute.Heinz-Dietrich L√∂we, \\"Pogroms in Russia: Explanations, Comparisons, Suggestions\\", Jewish Social Studies , New Series, Vol. 11, No. 1 (Autumn, 2004) , pp. 17 The Kiev Pogroms of 1919 were not the first of their kind in Ukraine, and other instances of violence occurred and were carried out against Jews in and around Kiev in the 1880s Kiev Pogrom (1881) and the first decade of the 20th century Kiev Pogrom (1905). Ultimately the tension from these events never really subsided, it laid just beneath the surface and could be seen as a cause of further violence. However the Jewish massacres in the Ukraine in the year 1919, which set the whole land ablaze, can not be compared with these previous pogroms due to its essence and scope. The Kiev Pogroms of 1919 were the bloodiest and the most atypical of the pogroms in Ukraine, taking place after the fall of the imperial regime and under conditions of bitter strife, where violence of every kind was basically unrestrained. Fueled by anti-semitism and propaganda against the Jews, the massacre of the Jews in Kiev, in 1919, was essentially a method for Political Warfare.Elias Hiefetz, The Slaughter of the Jews In the Ukraine In 1919, 1921, preface The tsarist regime attempted to \\"divert the attention of the socially and politically discontented masses in another direction, the direction of least resistance.\\" Elias Hiefetz, The Slaughter of the Jews In the Ukraine In 1919, 1921, chapter 1. Essentially it was a way of redirecting popular discontent away from the government and onto a visible minority group. They did this by inciting the lower classes against the Jews who were largely defenseless, and who, they also proposed, were responsible for the misery of the people as a whole. The Jews were depicted as the exploiters of the people, as the leeches of society, who drained the blood of the worker and robbed him of the bounty of his economic activity. Another cause of the Kiev Pogroms of 1919, was economic difficulties and changes in the urban environment. Economic difficulties and political strife tended to increase the probability of pogroms and this was certainly the case with Ukraine which was in a state of conflict and transition during the Ukrainian War of Independence and afterwards when it had separated from Russia. The stress of changes in the urban environment also provided fertile ground for violence against Jews, stresses such as immigration, not only by Jews from other parts of the empire but by outsiders in general made the pogroms possible.Heinz-Dietrich L√∂we, \\"Pogroms in Russia: Explanations, Comparisons, Suggestions\\", Jewish Social Studies , New Series, Vol. 11, No. 1 (Autumn, 2004) , pp. 18 See also * Kiev pogrom (1905) * Kishinev pogrom Footnotes Further references * Harold Henry Fisher: The Famine in Soviet Russia, 1919-1923: The Operations of the American Relief Administration * William Henry Chamberlin, The Russian Revolution, 1917-1921.

Two of the games included, Half-Life 2 and its first stand-alone expansion, Episode One, had previously been released as separate products. Three new games were also included in the compilation: the second stand-alone expansion, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, the puzzle game Portal, and Team Fortress 2, the multiplayer game sequel to Team Fortress Classic. Valve also released a soundtrack containing music from the games within the compilation. A separate product entitled The Black Box was planned, which would have included only the new games, but was later canceled. The Orange Box was first released for Microsoft Windows and the Xbox 360 in October 2007, while the PlayStation 3 version, developed by EA UK was released in December 2007. A digital Orange Box pack, containing the five games, was released in May 2010 for Mac OS X following the release of Steam for the platform, while a similar version for Linux followed after the Steam's clients release for Linux in early 2013. The Orange Box received critical acclaim, with Portal being recognized as a surprise favorite of the package. The PlayStation 3 version of The Orange Box was noted for several technical shortcomings that were not present in the other versions, only a few of which were fixed through a single patch. Overview Episode Two introduced new rural environments to the Half-Life series. The Orange Box features five complete games compiled into one retail unit: Half-Life 2 and its two continuations, Episode One and Episode Two; Portal; and Team Fortress 2. All of these games use Valve's Source engine. Through the Steam platform for the Windows version, the games can collect and report in-depth data such as where the player's character died, completion time, and total victories in multiplayer modes. This data is compiled to generate gameplay statistics for Episode One, Episode Two, and Team Fortress 2. Although Half-Life 2 has the largest proportion of Achievements, there are 99 spread across all five games, exceeding the 50-Achievement limit that Microsoft maintains to feature the most Achievements of any Xbox 360 product. These Achievements include killing a certain number of monsters, finding hidden weapon caches, or other tasks specific to each game. All the games except Half-Life 2 contain in-game commentary that can be enabled, allowing the player to listen to the developers discuss the creation and purpose of particular sections and components of each game. This has been a feature of every Valve game since Half-Life 2: Lost Coast due to the commentary's popularity in that game, according to Erik Wolpaw, lead writer for Portal. =Half-Life 2= Half-Life 2 is a science fiction first-person shooter game and the sequel to Half-Life. While remaining similar in style to the original, Half-Life 2 introduces new concepts to the series such as physics-based puzzles and vehicle sections. The game takes place in the fictional City 17 and surrounding areas as the player takes on the role of scientist Gordon Freeman. Freeman is thrust into a dystopian environment in which the aftermath of the events of Half-Life have come to bear fully upon human society, and he is forced to fight against increasingly unfavorable odds in order to survive. In his struggle, he is joined by various acquaintances, including former Black Mesa colleagues, oppressed citizens of City 17, and the Vortigaunts, all of whom later prove to be valuable allies. Half-Life 2 received critical acclaim, including 35 Game of the Year awards, when it was originally released for Windows in 2004. , over 6.5 million copies of Half-Life 2 have been sold at retail. Although Steam sales figures are unknown, their rate surpassed retail's in mid-2008 and they are significantly more profitable per-unit. =Half-Life 2: Episode One= Half-Life 2: Episode One continues from the events of Half-Life 2. Episode One builds on the original, adding cooperative play with friendly non-player characters such as Alyx Vance, whose new abilities complement Freeman's abilities and allow her to comprehend and respond to the player's actions by lending help. It is set immediately after the end of Half-Life 2 in the war-torn City 17 and nearby areas. Episode One follows scientist Gordon Freeman and his companion Alyx Vance as they continue to cope with the events chronicled in Half-Life 2 and humanity's continuing struggle against the Combine. The game was originally released in 2006 for Windows as a standalone game and was generally well received. =Half-Life 2: Episode Two= Half-Life 2: Episode Two was first available as part of The Orange Box and focuses on expansive environments, travel, and less linear play. In the game, Gordon Freeman and the series' other major characters move away from City 17 to the surrounding wilderness following the closing events of Episode One. The game was praised for its new environments and features and was well received by critics. =Portal= Portal is a single-player first- person action/puzzle game that was first available as part of The Orange Box. The game consists primarily of a series of puzzles, solved by creating portals which the player and simple objects can pass through in order to reach an exit point, while being ordered by an AI-programmed robot named GLaDOS. The portal system and the unusual physics it creates are the emphasis of the game. Portal was a surprise favorite of The Orange Box, receiving widespread praise and several Game of the Year awards. =Team Fortress 2= Team Fortress 2's graphical style has been well received by critics. Team Fortress 2 is a multiplayer team-based first-person shooter that was first available as part of The Orange Box. The game is a sequel to the original Quake modification, Team Fortress, and Valve's Half-Life modification, Team Fortress Classic. Its focus is on two competing teams that attack each other in order to achieve varying objectives, including capturing control points or defending them from attack, or capturing a flag. Players can choose to play as one of nine classes in these teams, each with different strengths and weaknesses. Unlike most other Source-powered games, Team Fortress 2 features a cartoon art style and non-realistic graphics. Team Fortress 2 was very well received by critics; it was particularly praised for its unique artistic direction and graphics. It is the only multiplayer game to appear in the collection. The Xbox 360 version has not received any updates since July 21, 2009 and the PlayStation 3 version received no updates at all, both missing out on most of the PC exclusive content such as item drops, custom loadouts, new gamemodes, cosmetics, new weapons, and trading. The game was made free-to-play in 2011, at which point all players who had purchased the game before that point (either on its own or through the Orange Box) were awarded an exclusive hat named \\"The Proof of Purchase.\\" Purchasing the Orange Box still awards the item. Development =The Black Box= Valve planned on releasing an additional compilation for Windows entitled The Black Box, which would have contained only the new material‚ÄîEpisode Two, Portal, and Team Fortress 2. The Black Box was later cancelled for retail and is now only available through Steam exclusively to owners of certain ATI graphics cards, who received a voucher for a free copy of The Black Box. During development, the simultaneous release of two game compilation packages with different content combinations was touted by Valve as a new direction for the game industry. Gabe Newell, co-founder of Valve, said, \\"The Black Box and The Orange Box represent a new approach to publishing multiple products on multiple platforms.\\" After first discontinuing The Black Box, however, Valve released all the new material for individual download via Steam. The Black Box was to be priced lower than The Orange Box. To compensate for the cancellation of The Black Box, Valve offered gift subscriptions to Steam users who had previously purchased Half-Life 2 or Half-Life 2: Episode One and then purchased The Orange Box so that they could give their second copies of those two games as gifts to people added to their Steam Friends list. Still, the cancellation of The Black Box sparked complaints from game critics and consumers alike, unhappy that they were obliged to pay for games that they already owned. It also raised concerns among those who had bought the ATI Radeon HD 2900 XT graphics card, which came with a voucher for The Black Box, but Valve clarified that only the retail version of The Black Box had been cancelled. While Valve never expressed its reasons for this decision, industry writers speculated that it might have been to increase profits on retail copies or to avoid customer confusion between similar game packages and their availability across the platforms. =PlayStation 3 version= While the Windows and Xbox 360 versions of The Orange Box were developed and published by Valve, the development of the PlayStation 3 port was outsourced to the Electronic Arts studio EA UK. In an interview with Edge magazine before the game's release, Valve co-founder Gabe Newell commented, \\"I think the people who have The Orange Box on the PS3 are going to be happy with their game experience. We've done the PC and 360 versions here and EA has a team doing the PS3 version ‚Äì and they'll make the PS3 version a good product; EA got the job done in putting a lot of people with PS3 experience on the project. But I think it's harder to get it to the same standard as the 360 and PC versions\\". Despite this, he noted that Valve will probably handle PlayStation 3 versions of its products in the future. In a preview of The Orange Box in November 2007, 1UP.com revealed numerous problems with the late beta build of EA's PlayStation 3 version of The Orange Box, citing pervasive frame rate issues which, they claimed, \\"at best merely hinder gameplay and at worst make the experience downright unplayable.\\" IGN's Hilary Goldstein disagreed, writing that although EA \\"is one of the worst offenders when it comes to porting games to the PS3,\\" the frame rate issues were not bad enough \\"to make me throw my controller in disgust.\\" On January 3, 2008, IGN reported that Valve employees had created a thread on Valve's website forums for players to list the problems they had encountered and to suggest fixes, which caused speculation that a patch was being planned to address the issues in the PlayStation 3 version, such as the frame rate issues, the connection problems in Team Fortress 2, and the slow loading times in Portal. A patch for the PlayStation 3 version was later released in North America on March 19, 2008 and in Europe a short while after that; however, it made no mention of fixing frame rate issues or slow loading times. =Region-specific versions= Valve deactivated accounts with CD keys that were purchased outside of the consumer's territory in order to maintain the integrity of region-specific licensing. This generated complaints from North American customers who had circumvented their Steam end-user license agreement by purchasing The Orange Box through cheaper, Asian retailers. Some customers who then purchased the game a second time from a local vendor experienced difficulty adding the new CD key to their accounts in order to activate their newly purchased games and also had trouble communicating with Steam's customer support team about this problem. Doug Lombardi of Valve stated, \\"Some of these users have subsequently purchased a legal copy after realizing the issue and were having difficulty removing the illegitimate keys from their Steam accounts. Anyone having this problem should contact Steam Support to have the Thai key removed from their Steam account.\\" The German version of The Orange Box is set to a low violence mode in order to comply with German laws regulating the sale of violent video games. Blood effects are replaced by sparks and bullet wounds are replaced with dents as if the characters were metal robots. Additionally in Team Fortress 2, instead of body parts being scattered after a player's character is blown apart, various items such as hamburgers, coils, rubber ducks, and Chattery Teeth appear (known as \\"sillygibs\\" by the community). Characters from different classes leave different items and different ratios of these items when killed by explosives. In the Half-Life games, bodies fade away after the death of non- player characters and the blood has been altered to a gray color. =Soundtrack= The soundtrack for The Orange Box consists of music that Valve employees composed for Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Portal, and Team Fortress 2. It also includes the original version and an exclusive remix of \\"Still Alive\\", both by Jonathan Coulton. It was released on December 21, 2007 and is sold by the official Valve Store, Amazon.com, and digital music services such as iTunes, Napster, and eMusic. A more-complete version of this soundtrack that also includes music files from Half-Life and Half-Life 2 was released on Steam as part of the Audiosurf package. \\"Still Alive\\" was subsequently released as a free downloadable song for the rhythm game Rock Band on March 31, 2008. =Promotions= Pre-purchasing of the Windows version on Steam began on September 11, 2007. Those who pre-purchased via this method received a ten-percent discount and were able to play the Team Fortress 2 beta starting on September 17, 2007. The Orange Box comes with Peggle Extreme, a ten-level playable demo of Peggle Deluxe that is only available for PC, with graphical themes from The Orange Box. Peggle, published by PopCap Games, is a puzzle game combining elements of pinball and pachinko. Reception franchise. The Orange Box was met with universal acclaim from reviewers. The averaging website GameRankings cites both the Xbox 360 version and the PC version as the highest-rated game of their respective platforms. AllGame editor Mark Hoogland called The Orange Box \\"the gold standard for bundled (video) games\\". IGN described The Orange Box as \\"the best deal in video game history,\\" and awarded both the Windows and Xbox 360 versions with an Editors' Choice Award. All three versions won GameSpot's Editors' Choice Award. Approximately 3 million copies of The Orange Box were sold by the end of November 2008. Portal was singled out for praise by reviewers. Official Xbox Magazine admired its unique puzzle gameplay mechanics, stating that it was the first major advance in puzzle gaming \\"since Russians started dropping blocks\\", referring to Tetris. Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw, The Escapist's usually acerbically critical reviewer, stated in his Zero Punctuation review that he could not think of any criticism for Portal, saying that it had \\"some of the funniest pitch-black humor [he had] ever heard in a game\\" and concluded that it is \\"absolutely sublime from start to finish.\\" The PlayStation 3 version's critical review scores suffered because of the technical issues first uncovered by 1UP.com. While discussing the retail version on a podcast, 1UP.com staff members agreed that a significant number of the frame rate problems had been resolved, but not all of them. They concluded that the PlayStation 3 version was not quite as smooth as the Xbox 360 version and recommended that \\"if you own both [consoles], you should do the 360\\" version. Kotaku's Michael McWhertor echoed that recommendation, though stated that those who only have a PlayStation 3 should still consider The Orange Box. While frame rate issues were the main complaint, the PlayStation 3 version was also criticized for unreliable voice chat and excessive network delay or lag in Team Fortress 2, as well as long load times generally. It was, however, praised for featuring anti-aliasing and a quick-save feature, neither of which were present in the Xbox 360 version (but were present in the PC version). After release, the game received further criticism from fans for the lack of surround sound support when using an optical cable. An open letter to Valve, asking them to put pressure on EA to release a fix was posted to the Steam forum. A response was posted by a Valve employee going by the name of \\"BurtonJ\\", directing disappointed customers to a dedicated thread on the subject. =Awards= The Orange Box won a number of awards for its overall high standard and use of technology. The compilation won \\"Computer Game of the Year\\" at the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' 11th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards (now known as the D.I.C.E. Awards) and was nominated in the \\"Overall Game of the Year\\", \\"Action Game of the Year\\", and \\"Outstanding Innovation in Gaming\\" categories. The Orange Box won the \\"Breakthrough Technology Award\\" and the \\"Best PC Game Award\\" at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards, and was additionally nominated in the \\"Game of the Year\\", \\"Best Shooter\\", \\"Best Xbox 360 Game\\", and \\"Best Multiplayer Game\\" categories. It was also named the second-best video game of 2007 by Time Magazine, while the PlayStation 3 version was nominated in the category of Action and Adventure at the BAFTA Video Games Awards. Valve also received developer awards for their work on The Orange Box. The Orange Box received 17 Game of the Year awards and over 100 awards in total. The Orange Box was placed as the 22nd most influential video game in history by the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition, 2009. Portal won \\"Outstanding Achievement in Game Design\\", \\"Outstanding Achievement in Gameplay Engineering\\", and \\"Outstanding Character Performance\\" for Ellen McLain's vocal portrayal of GLaDOS at the 11th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. The game won 76 awards, including 37 Game of the Year awards, and was recognized for innovative design and game mechanics. The dark humor of Portal and the ending music track \\"Still Alive\\" were also singled out for awards. Team Fortress 2 was nominated in the categories of \\"Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction\\" and \\"Outstanding Achievement in Animation\\" at the 11th Interactive Achievement Awards. Although unsuccessful at the IAA, the game did receive 10 awards, including five Game of the Year awards, and other awards for its artistic direction and multiplayer gameplay. Half-Life 2: Episode Two won four awards, including one Game of the Year award, and was recognized for excellent NPC AI, level design, and story.

In recent years the companies suffered a financial downturn, and have been the subject of intense criticism and litigation for allegedly illegal business practices as a residential landlord. Corporate Structure and Holdings CitiApartments, Inc. is a subsidiary of Skyline Realty, Inc., and also operates buildings owned by various limited liability companies, all of which are in turn owned by founder Frank Lembi and various members of his family. Among the most prominent of these are Trophy Properties and Ritz Apartments. As of 2006 and 2007 CitiApartments and its affiliates owned 307 apartment buildings with a total of more than 6,500 apartment units housing more than 7,000 residents, making it the second-largest owner of residential rental property in San Francisco at the time. It also owned five boutique hotels, two office buildings, a real estate brokerage, a mortgage brokerage, and a property management firm.  History  = Origins = Frank Lembi, originally a pharmacist, became a real estate broker after returning from military service in 1946. Shortly after, he formed Skyline Realty as a brokerage. He bought the business outright upon his business partner's death in 1968. Lembi's empire today includes: FirstApartments (created to substitute CitiApartments), Personality Hotels, CitiSuites, Hotel Diva. = Recent Business Developments = Beginning in the early 1990s Skyline Realty shifted its focus from brokering real estate to buying and managing apartments. CitiApartments has taken a buy and hold approach to its investments, making heavily leveraged purchases of mid-sized older buildings in nearly every neighborhood of San Francisco but mostly in the Tenderloin and Nob Hill. Because most of the city's housing stock comprises smaller buildings, with only several large complexes, the company achieved a dominant position within its market. Due to San Francisco's strict rent control laws, which prohibit all but very modest rent increases and prevent landlords from terminating tenancies without cause, CitiApartments could not immediately profit from building upgrades. Instead, it took a longer-term approach by: * Offering buyouts and incentives for tenants to relocate * Waiting until tenants left before renovating their units * Re- renting upgraded units at much higher market rates, or as high-rent furnished corporate suites or hotel rooms * Cutting building management expenses = A family business = Founder Frank Lembi's son, Walter Lembi, was a significant owner until his death in 2010. Grandson Taylor Lembi also owns two apartment buildings and is part of the business. David Raynal, COO, is Frank Lembi's nephew. In various combinations and through affiliated companies they own the buildings managed by CitiApartments.  Controversy  = Lawsuits = On August 16, 2006, the Office of the City Attorney of San Francisco filed a lawsuit against CitiApartments and related companies and individuals claiming an \\"egregious pattern of illegal business practices\\" that amounted to a \\"panoply of lawlessness, intimidation tactics, [and] retaliation against residents.\\" Among the city's claims are: intimidating tenants into leaving rent controlled units, unannounced visits by armed guards, illegally entering units, changing locks, shutting off utilities, retaliating against tenants who refused buy-outs, remodeling units without necessary permits or inspections, and illegally renting out residential units as hotel rooms and executive suites. In April, 2006, 23 tenants filed a private lawsuit against the companies. Among the claims are intimidation of tenants by armed guards, harassment and threats, coercive interrogation sessions to pressure tenants into signing agreements, illegal construction intended to harass tenants, and tenant lockouts, all intended to force below-market rent controlled tenants to leave so the company could renovate and re-rent at a higher rate. In addition there have been numerous lawsuits against the companies on behalf of individual plaintiffs. One of which was handled by San Francisco landlord/tenant attorney Drexel Bradshaw of Bradshaw & Associates, P.C., who sued CitiApartments under the RICO statute of 1970. The fraudulent use of the telephone and U.S. mail is cause for RICO prosecution. In July, 2009 several additional lawsuits were filed against CitiApartments Inc. and at least 56 related entities, including one class action suit, by former tenants alleging a deliberate pattern of illegally withholding and delaying return of rental deposits. CitiApartments was sanctioned more than $30,000 in one instance, and $50,000 in another, for what a judge described as \\"willful\\" failure to comply with document discovery requests. = Eliminating competition = CitiApartments often paid as much as 50% more for a building than its value to the rest of the market, and as a result may have raised overall market prices by 5-10%. This drove away competition from weaker and more cash-sensitive property investors. Starting in late 2006 it bought nearly all of the multi- unit apartments sold in the city as they became available. Critics claimed that the only reason CitiApartments could afford the premium was that it made more money on buildings than companies that operate within the limits of the law, or that it made unrealistically optimistic promises to its lenders about its ability to force rent-controlled tenants out of their apartments. = Shaky finances = CitiApartments and its sister companies bought buildings on credit from outside investors, with down payments as low as 5% of the total purchase price (as opposed to 30-40%, which is more common for comparable commercial real estate purchases). Because of the high prices paid for buildings, and the high amount financed, the buildings have negative cash flow and cannot support their mortgage. The company's lenders typically provided higher than usual loan reserves that would give CitiApartments sufficient money to make interest payments while also paying off or evicting existing tenants, based on a financial model by which it would replace at least 75% of the tenants within two years. Critics long complained that in the event of a market downturn or other unexpected event, CitiApartments was in danger of defaulting on its mortgages and would have to sell them at distressed prices or in foreclosure, which would have a ripple effect that depresses commercial real estate throughout San Francisco. Such predictions came to pass in January, 2009, when the parent company had to assign 51 of its (then) 307 properties to one lender, UBS AG, in lieu of foreclosure, because they collectively had a negative cash flow of approximately $3 million per month. In 2009 the Lembi Group was in financial distress due to a combination of softening rents due to the late 2000s recession (which hurt the effectiveness of its strategy of replacing existing rent-control tenants by attrition and eviction), inability to renew or refinance existing loans due to the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010, and a resulting decrease in value and saleability of commercial properties that made it impossible to re-sell buildings to avoid foreclosure. Given the high financial leverage and the group's having initially paid above-market prices, many of their loans were underwater. As of that time the company was attempting to renegotiate approximately $1 billion in loans, and in possible default on another $164 million loan. By the summer of 2009 the company had transferred 51 properties to one lender in lieu of foreclosure, and was in foreclosure proceedings on more than 60 others. On Oct. 29, 2009 the San Francisco Chronicle published a story stating the Clark County, Nev., district attorney's office, has \\"a warrant out for Walter Lembi, managing director of the financially troubled Lembi Group, for allegedly passing $298,500 worth of bad checks earlier this year at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.\\" = Past Controversies = Frank Lembi was CEO of Continental Savings of America, a savings and loan institution that was taken over by the Office of Thrift Supervision to prevent insolvency due to bad high-risk real estate loans in the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. He and son Walter were named in numerous lawsuits related to that company. = CitiApartments Response = To promote its position as a caretaker of San Francisco's older housing stock, CitiApartments had co-hosted various housing-related and low- income charities and causes, and provided one nearly free studio apartment to a needy family. It disseminated numerous press releases on the subject since the inception of the lawsuits and adopted the slogan \\"Restoring San Francisco's Neighborhoods.\\" CitiApartments through interviews and press releases categorically denied all claims, and rejected all criticism made against it with respect to violating its tenants rights. It described itself as an upstanding property manager, and claimed that any disputes with tenants were groundless, minor, or normal and incidental for a landlord of its size. = Bankruptcy = In February 2020, Four real estate companies owned by San Francisco's largest landlord, the Lembi Group, filed a bankruptcy court in California for Chapter 11 protection. The companies are members of the CitiApartments Inc, Lembi Group's biggest shareholder of apartments in San Francisco. The four companies put 16 residential assets together, which became leverage for a $132.4 million loan.

The investigation focused on eight members of the 2007 De Anza College baseball team. The allegations were investigated by the Santa Clara County, California Sheriff's Department, and reviewed by Santa Clara County District Attorney Dolores Carr. June 4, 2007, Carr stated that no charges would be filed. This decision was questioned by many, and the Office of the California Attorney General Jerry Brown was invited by the prosecutor to perform an independent investigation of the available evidence. May 2, 2008, the Attorney General's office determined that there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone present with a crime. Allegations of assault Three members of the De Anza College women's soccer team alleged that, on March 4, 2007, while attending a party off-campus at the home of a member of the college's baseball team, they heard a commotion, and knelt to look through an un-screened French door pane. They witnessed an intoxicated 17-year-old girl being sexually assaulted by two or more people. They further stated that a number of other people were in the same room, observing the incident and cheering. They were told to go away and the door was blocked. The women stated that they intervened, removed the girl, and took her to the hospital.Witnesses to Alleged De Anza Rape Speak Out http://www.ktvu.com/news/13370961/detail.html It was found she was covered with someone else's vomit. Investigation The members of the soccer team reported the incident, and the Santa Clara Sheriff's Department investigated. No arrests were made, even after a second woman came forward to say that she too had been sexually assaulted by De Anza college baseball players. The results of the investigation were turned over to the Office of the Santa Clara County District Attorney. The sheriffs did not investigate the scene until nearly 23 hours after the woman was brought to hospital. The district attorney's office conducted additional investigations, and presented its evidence to a grand jury. On June 4, 2007, District Attorney Dolores Carr announced that she would not charge anyone involved in the alleged incident with a crime. Carr later explained that to reveal the details of the case that led her to this decision would have a chilling effect on other rape claims. Santa Clara Sheriff Laurie Smith stated that she believed a sexual assault did occur. D.A. Carr submitted the case to the Office of the State Attorney General for review. Public reaction and aftermath The decision not to prosecute was questioned widely. There was negative reaction in the form of public protests, and adverse comments by the county sheriff, by a number of newspaper columnists, and editorial page writers. Carr invited Jerry Brown, then the California Attorney General, to conduct an independent assessment of the evidence. Brown accepted, and his office commenced an investigation, later releasing its results. It determined there was evidence that a crime had occurred, but there was also insufficient evidence to identify those responsible. The investigation noted the physical descriptions of the attackers varied so widely that they could not be accurately identified. The victim was characterized as having no memory of the incident after her arrival at the party. The report concluded that these factors made proof beyond a reasonable doubt, as required for a criminal trial, impossible. The report further indicated that widespread intoxication among the party's attendees hampered the accuracy and reliability of their memories of the event. As a result, Carr's office announced that no charges would be filed, and the criminal case was closed. ABC News 20/20 episode An ABC News 20/20 episode aired on June 5, 2009 on the 2007 De Anza case. During the episode April Groelle, Lauren Chief Elk and Lauren Bryeans allege that they witnessed a rape of a teenager by members of the baseball team and stated: if three witnesses aren't enough, 'why is rape even a crime?' Meanwhile, Sheriff Laurie Smith called the case 'frustrating', saying it was possible the baseball players were sticking to a code of silence. After the episode, one of the baseball players gave an interview about the party. Civil case The victim then proceeded to take the case to civil court in February 2011, seeking monetary compensation from her attackers. Defendants Knopf and Chadwick claimed that the sex was consensual. Six other men were also listed in the lawsuit when the trial began in late February, but subsequently settled with the plaintiff or had the lawsuit against them dismissed. In the civil trial, another woman, \\"Jane Doe II\\", indicated that she wanted to testify about her own rape by one of the defendants in Jane Doe's case, which took place 10 weeks before the 2007 party. That defendant later settled, but according to the plaintiff's attorneys, a witness came forward placing Chadwick in the room during Jane Doe II's rape. Jane Doe II's case was excluded from the trial, as the court found there was not enough evidence that Chadwick had planned the attacks. On April 7, 2011, the jury in the civil case found Knopf and Chadwick to be not liable for the allegations against them so no damages were awarded. After Judge Aaron Persky's sentencing of Brock Turner in 2016, Persky was criticized by Jane Doe's attorneys for allowing suggestive photos of the unidentified victim, taken at a party a year after the gang rape, into evidence, and preventing other victims from testifying.Was Stanford rape judge Aaron Persky biased in 2011 case?. Daily Forward, Josefin Doleston, June 10, 2016. Retrieved 21 June 2016. Attorneys for \\"Jane Doe\\" said the photographs were not the only evidence that Persky unfairly permitted. Four of the baseball players had invoked Fifth Amendment rights not to self-incriminate during the discovery phase of the litigation. According to a lawyer for Doe, that was a critical juncture: it prevented the victim's team from obtaining evidence that could have helped them pursue their case. The original judge in the case ruled in 2010 that the defendants could refuse to testify, but that would also mean that they would be prohibited from subsequently testifying in the case. That ruling was, however, overturned by Persky after he took over the trial in 2011, a move that Doe's attorneys say undermined her case. Persky was recalled by voters on June 5, 2018.
