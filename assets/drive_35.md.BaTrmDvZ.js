Movements within the manosphere include the men's rights movement, incels (involuntary celibates), Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW), Pick-up artists (PUA), and fathers' rights groups. The manosphere has been associated with online harassment as well as some mass shootings and other real-world acts of violence, and has been implicated in radicalizing men into committing violence against women.  History  The manosphere grew out of social movements such as the men's liberation movement of the 1970s and 80s. Groups now considered to be a part of the manosphere, such as the men's rights movement, predate the term \\"manosphere\\". The term, a play on the word \\"blogosphere\\", is believed to have first appeared on Blogspot in 2009. It was subsequently popularized by Ian Ironwood, a pornography marketer and author. The term entered the popular lexicon when news media began to use it in stories about men who had committed acts of misogynist violence, sexual assault, and online harassment. 2010 has been identified as \\"a clear tipping point\\" by researcher Emma A. Jane, at which the manosphere communities moved towards the mainstream from their previous position on the fringes of the Internet. She hypothesizes that this popularization was spurred by the advent of Web 2.0 and the rise of social media, in combination with ongoing systemic misogyny and patriarchal society. The manosphere was well established by 2014, and its ideas had entered more mainstream discourse, where they are sometimes used among men not necessarily identified with any specific manosphere group.  Ideology and content  The manosphere is a heterogenous group of online communities that includes men's-rights activists (MRAs),; ; ; ; incels (involuntary celibates),; ; Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW),; ; ; pick-up artists (PUAs),; ; ; ; ; and fathers' rights groups.; ; Some of these groups have adversarial relationships with one another. Debbie Ging writes that several groups, such as MRAs and PUAs, \\"exaggerate their differences in displays of infight posturing, in spite of the fact that their philosophies are almost identical\\". While the specifics of each group's ideology sometimes conflict, the general ideology of manosphere groups centers on the promotion of some forms of masculinity, hostility towards women, strong opposition to feminism, and exaggerated misogyny. Journalist Caitlin Dewey argues that the main tenets of the manosphere can be reduced to (1) the corruption of modern society by feminism, in violation of inherent sex differences between men and women; and (2) the ability of men to save society and/or achieve sexual prowess by adopting a hyper-masculine role and forcing women to submit to them.Dewey, quoted in The manosphere has its own distinct jargon. Men are commonly divided into \\"alpha\\" and \\"beta\\" males within an evolutionary-psychology framework, where \\"alphas\\" are seen as sexually dominant and attractive to women, who are hardwired to want sex with alphas but will pair with \\"beta\\" males for financial benefits. Among MRAs and PUAs this argument is known as \\"alpha fux beta bux\\". \\"Red pill\\" philosophy, using a metaphor borrowed from the film The Matrix, is a central tenet of the manosphere; it concerns awakening men to the supposed reality that society is fundamentally misandrist and dominated by feminist values. Donna Zuckerberg writes, \\"The Red Pill represents a new phase in online misogyny. Its members not only mock and belittle women; they also believe that in our society, men are oppressed by women.\\" Manospherians believe that feminists and political correctness obscure this reality, and that men are victims who must fight to protect their existence. Accepting the manosphere's ideology is equated with \\"taking the red pill\\", and those who do not are seen as \\"blue pilled\\" or as having \\"taken the blue pill\\". Such terminology originated on the antifeminist subreddit /r/TheRedPill and was later taken up by men's rights and MGTOW sites. The manosphere is associated with the far-right and the neoreactionary, white nationalist alt-right movement. Zuckerberg writes that many alt-right members are either pick-up artists or MGTOW, and \\"the policing of white female sexuality is a major concern\\" of the alt-right, The severity of the antifeminism espoused within these communities varies, with some espousing fairly mild sexism and others glorifying extreme hatred. Racism and xenophobia are also common among groups in the manosphere, and perceived threats against \\"Western civilization\\" are a popular topic. The manosphere has been associated with online harassment as well as some mass shootings and other real-world acts of violence, and has been implicated in radicalizing men into committing violence against women. Sites The manosphere comprises various websites, blogs, and online forums. Noted sites include /r/TheRedPill, Return of Kings, A Voice for Men, PUAHate, and SlutHate. Reddit has been a popular gathering place for manosphere supporters, and several forums on the site are geared toward its ideas. However, in the late 2010s Reddit began to take steps to discourage more extreme manosphere subreddits. Some were banned, such as /r/incels (banned in 2017) and its successor /r/braincels (banned in 2018); other subreddits such as /r/MGTOW and /r/TheRedPill have been \\"quarantined\\", meaning that a warning is displayed to users about the content of the subreddit and users must sign in before they're allowed to enter. As a result, some of these communities have found new homes on websites that are more welcoming of extreme content, such as Gab. Public perception The manosphere has received significant coverage in the media from its association with high-profile violent attacks including the 2014 Isla Vista killings in California, the 2015 Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon, and the 2018 Toronto van attack, as well as phenomena such as the sustained online abuse towards female members of the video game community that came to be known as Gamergate. Following the Isla Vista shooting, the killer Elliot Rodger was found to have been an active participant on the PUAHate manosphere forum. Following the attack, Dewey wrote that, while the manosphere was not to blame for Rodger's attack, \\"Rodger's misogynistic rhetoric seems undeniably influenced by the manosphere\\". The sociologist Michael Kimmel argued \\"it would be facile to argue the manosphere ... urged [Rodger] to do this. I think those places are kind of a solace ... They provide a kind of locker room, a place where guys can gripe about all the bad things that are being done to them by women\\". Arthur Goldwag described the manosphere in the Spring 2012 edition of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Report as an \\"underworld of misogynists, woman-haters whose fury goes well beyond criticism of the family court system, domestic violence laws, and false rape accusations... [who are] devoted to attacking virtually all women (or, at least, Westernized ones).\\" He added a caveat later that year, saying, \\"It should be mentioned that the SPLC did not label MRAs as members of a hate movement; nor did our article claim that the grievances they air on their websites ‚Äì false rape accusations, ruinous divorce settlements and the like ‚Äì are all without merit. But we did call out specific examples of misogyny and the threat, overt or implicit, of violence.\\" In 2018, the SPLC added male supremacy as a category they track on their list of hate groups. The British anti-extremism group Hope not Hate included the manosphere in its 2019 State of Hate report.

Today, passenger services on the 64.5 km-long Hamburg Eidelstedt‚ÄìNeum√ºnster section are operated by AKN. The stations on the current line of A1 between Hamburg Hauptbahnhof and Eidelstedt in the Hamburg urban area were not part of the original route and are served only occasionally by the AKN.  History  A VTA railcar of the AKN on the line On 8 September 1884, the Altona- Kaltenkirchner Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft (Altona-Kaltenkirchen Railway Company), which was established in the previous year, opened the line from Altona to Kaltenkirchen for passenger traffic. Freight operations commenced on 24 November 1884. The line was initially operated by the Kintzel & Lauser company, which had also built the line and owned share in the Altona- Kaltenkirchen Railway Company. There was initially no provision for the transfer of freight to the state railways, but it was possible for freight to connect with the Hamburg tramway in Altona. Accordingly, a central buffer coupling was selected, which was also necessary at the beginning because of the sharp curves of the line. The AKE took over the management of the line in 1892. The line was originally planned as narrow gauge railway, but it was then built as standard gauge. It largely followed the Altona-Kiel road (Altona- Kieler Chaussee) built between 1830 and 1832 with its southernmost section running north along Holstensra√üe from the Kaltenkirchen station (Kaltenkirchener Bahnhof) in G√§hlerplatz in Altona. It ran over the Hamburg- Altona link line using folding track (this was able to fold to give one line or the other a clear passage), running on street level from Schulterblatt station (about where Haubachstra√üe now runs) to the Viktoria barracks. Further north it crossed the border of the common customs territory of Hamburg/Altona where the Bahnhof Nebenzollamt (minor customs office railway station) was established. Customs checks were carried out there until 1888 when Hamburg joined the Zollverein (German customs union). In 1893, the link line was rebuilt on an embankment to the north of the Holsten Brewery and Holstensra√üe station was built, as it exists today, with the AKE operating at street level on the G√§hlersplatz‚ÄìNebenzollamt section. On 20 August 1898, the line was extended via Kaltenkirchen to Bramstedt and Nebenzollamt station was renamed as the Bramstedter Bahnhof (Bramstedt line station). South of Eidelstedt there was a slope that caused difficulties for longer trains. In 1902, a connection was built to the state railway in Eidelstedt, where freight wagons were transferred. On 17 December 1912, the line between Altona and Eidelstedt was laid parallel to the Hamburg-Altona‚ÄìKiel railway on the current route because of the increasing traffic of the Altona-Kiel road. The line speed was now 40 km/h. The terminus in Altona was to the north of the link line in Sonderburger Platz, now Kaltenkirchener Platz, at the newly built (second) Kaltenkirchen station. This was used by the post office until 1962 and was then taken over by it. A loading facility for parcel traffic was built on the site from 1965 to 1973; until then parcel traffic had been housed in the old post office building on Stephansplatz. Permission to extend the line to Neum√ºnster was sought in 1913 and it was approved on 1 December 1914. Operation on the new line commenced on 1 August 1916. In 1914, the company had been renamed as the Eisenbahn Altona-Kaltenkirchen-Neum√ºnster (Altona-Kaltenkirchen-Neum√ºnster Railway). The terminus was at the Neum√ºnster S√ºd station on the Neum√ºnster‚ÄìBad Oldesloe railway. After the Second World War the track was left in a poor condition. Wiemersdorf station was destroyed by the explosion of an ammunition train. After 1957, the track was operated with a simplified form of train control using instruction over the radio. In 1962, a connection was built for the Hamburg S-Bahn to the AKN route from Holstenstrasse station, Diebsteich station was built and the southern terminus of the AKN route was moved to Langenfelde. In 1974, the track was rebuilt with continuously-welded rail. The platforms between Eidelstedt and Kaltenkirchen were raised to a uniform height of 76 cm and extedended to a length of 100 metres. Crossings were abolished or secured with half-barriers. This allowed the travel time between Kaltenkirchen and Eidelstedt to be reduced to between 38 and 44 minutes. A central signal box was put into operation in Ulzburg S√ºd in 1976 and signal boxes were also installed in Quickborn, Hamburg-Schnelsen and Kaltenkirchen (from 1982). Since 1983, they work with microprocessors instead of relay technology. Signalling on the line began to be controlled from an electronic interlocking in Kaltenkirchen from 2002. The entire route was converted by 2005. The line between Ulzburg S√ºd and Kaltenkirchen S√ºd was duplicated between 1997 and 2001. For this purpose, the line in Henstedt-Ulzburg was shifted by several hundred metres to the west. The line now passes under the centre through a 630-meter-long tunnel and the end of Henstedt-Ulzburg station towards the tunnel is now located underground. The operation of traffic on the new line started on 28 August 2000 and about a year later the work was completed and the new buildings were officially opened. Between Eidelstedt and Schnelsen part of the track was rebuilt between 2001 and 2004 to pass under three streets. A new Eidelstedt Zentrum station was built on this section. The entrance to Eidelstedt station was changed. The line passes under the eastern S-Bahn track and then connects with the S-Bahn tracks, making it possible for trains to continue on the S-Bahn tracks. South of Eidelstedt station it connects with the freight line towards Langenfelde. Since 2006, the line between Schnelsen and Quickborn has been upgraded; double track has been in operation between B√∂nningstedt and Hasloh since 28 October 2007. The Hasloh‚ÄìQuickborn S√ºd section has been duplicated since May 2011; this was followed by the commissioning of double track between Halstenbeker Stra√üe and Schnelsen station in October 2011. Double track has been operational between Schnelsen and B√∂nningstedt since October 2012. With the completion of this work, there will initially be no further duplication. Track renewals since 1989 have almost exclusively used Y-shaped sleepers. Over 100 km of the AKN network is now equipped with them. Between 2001 and 2004, Kaltenkirchen station was rebuilt in a cutting and a 400-metre-long tunnel was built to its north. This replaced several level crossing. Since 1 December 2002, the AKN has leased the section of line between Neum√ºnster S√ºd and Neum√ºnster from DB Netz and it runs to Neum√ºnster, continuing to Heide and B√ºsum.  Upgrades  New Kaltenkirchen station New and old Kaltenkirchen stations Kaltenkirchen S√ºd station The southern section of the line between Hamburg‚ÄìKaltenkirchen has been upgraded in many places since 1995. In the medium term it is planned to complete the duplication and to integrate it into the Hamburg S-Bahn network. The following projects, among others, had been completed by October 2012: *a grade separated connection with the S-Bahn network in Eidelstedt, *the new Eidelstedt Zentrum station in a sub-surface location, *duplication between Eidelstedt Zentrum and Quickborn, * duplication between Ulzburg S√ºd and Kaltenkirchen S√ºd with the elimination of all grade crossings and construction of a new Henstedt-Ulzburg station and a nearly 600 m long tunnel at this location, *a new Kaltenkirchen station in a sub-surface location. There continues to be single track between Eidelstedt and Kaltenkirchen, on individual sections between Eidelstedt and Eidelstedt Zentrum, between Quickborn and Ulzburg S√ºd and between Kaltenkirchen S√ºd and Kaltenkirchen. The entire line is controlled from the AKN operations centre in Kaltenkirchen via local electronic interlockings. All stations on the southern sector from Kaltenkirchen to Eidelstedt are equipped with electronic passenger information displays with the exception of Schnelsen; on the northern section individual stations such as Bad Bramstedt and Neum√ºnster S√ºd are so equipped. Former stations Elsensee station lay between Hasloh and Quickborn S√ºd and was mainly used by employees of the Th√∂rlschen margarine factory. This was closed during World War II due to air raids and moved to Hamburg-Harburg. Although superfluous, the station was only that closed in 1974 during the reconstruction of the line. Gut Gayen station lay between Bad Bramstedt and Wiemersdorf. A sandy platform still exists. Until 2002, Eidelstedt Ost station was a few hundred metres to the north of the current Eidelstedt Zentrum station. Current operation  AKN's local trains now run mainly at 20-minute intervals on the Eidelstedt-Kaltenkirchen section. These intervals apply on weekdays between 5 AM and 11 PM and on Saturday between 7 AM and 9 PM. In peak hours, there are additional services with trains largely running every 10 minutes. Later in the evenings and on Sundays, services run at 40-minute intervals. Between Kaltenkirchen and Neum√ºnster services mainly run every hour. In the peak, some trains on the A2 service (from Norderstedt Mitte to Ulzburg S√ºd) continue in the gaps between A1 services to Kaltenkirchen. A3 services also run between Henstedt-Ulzburg and Ulzburg S√ºd every hour. The busiest part of the line is the section between Ulzburg S√ºd and Henstedt- Ulzburg, which regularly has up to nine trains per hour in each direction. The route is regularly used for freight to and from the Norderstedt industrial railway (Norderstedter Industriebahn) and is required as a detour route when the Hamburg-Elmshorn-Neum√ºnster line is blocked for long-distance freight trains. Passengers  In 1884, the trip from Altona to Kaltenkirchen took more than two hours. Nevertheless, more than 150,000 passengers were carried in the first year. In 1930, the first railcars were used to carry the traffic more cost-effectively. After the Second World War daily passenger services were restored on 25 May 1945. In 1946, there were already ten daily passenger trains. Passenger numbers rose: in 1945 there were 1,495,000 passengers and in 1948 there were 3,883,000 passengers. From 31 March 1953, passenger services continued from Neum√ºnster S√ºd station over the tracks of Deutsche Bundesbahn‚Äôs Neum√ºnster‚ÄìBad Oldesloe line to Neum√ºnster station. With the extension of the Hamburg S-Bahn, the southern terminus for passenger services was moved from Kaltenkirchener station in Altona to Langenfelde in 1962 and finally to Eidelstedt in 1965. The S-Bahn tracks (now lines S21 and S3) are located west and parallel with the track of the AKN, which continues to be used for freight. In 1947, more than three million passengers were carried for the first time. The exact number was 3,517,733. In 1967, the number had fallen to 2.84973 million. When it became part of the Hamburger Verkehrsverbund (Hamburg Transport Association, HVV) numbers rose to 4.21393 million passengers in 1974. Freight  10,000 tonnes were carried in the first year. The biggest users were peat manufacturers. Initially, there was no direct transfer traffic with the state railway, all freight had to be transhipped. Transfer between the systems became possible in 1902. The line had 22 railway sidings with a total of 13.59 km of track in 1934. 560,000 tons of freight was carried in 1940, but it had fallen to 348,000 tons in 1950. Since 1 January 2008, the remaining freight traffic (mainly transfers from the main line of the Norderstedt industrial railway and from Boostedt station) has been carried by DB Schenker Rail. Rollingstock  Since the beginning of operations until the end of the Second World War, the AKN had a total of 28 steam locomotives, which handled all traffic until the arrival of the first railcars, built in 1930. Two more railcars were added before the end of the war. Five Esslingen railbuses were introduced for passenger services in 1951, which operated until 1963. From 1956 to 1963, MAN delivered ten more railbuses and an additional four Uerdingen railbuses were added. A total of ten control cars achieved the required capacity. In 1927 the AKN had 25 biaxial and five triaxial carriages, seven of which were also equipped for the carriage of mail. 42 covered and 72 open wagons were acquired from Deutsche Reichsbahn. Seven milk wagons carried the daily milk shipments. By 1960, this pool of rollingstock had changed only slightly. Milk wagons no longer appear in the statistics in 1936. Diesel locomotives operated for the first time on the AKN network in 1948. A total of 20 diesel locomotives operated on the line hauling freight until 1972. From 1976, new VTE railcars were operated between Eidelstedt and Kaltenkirchener. Since 1993, new VTA railcars have been used. Eight trains have been given third-rail current collectors, so that they could run on the S-Bahn network.

The first formation of the division was converted to a mechanized division after about nine months. Its second formation served for six months in 1942 in the defense of the fortress of Sevastopol, in the southern sector of the siege lines. After being destroyed there in July, a third division was formed by re- designating an existing rifle division near Leningrad in August, and it successfully held its positions for nearly a year and a half, in spite of shortages of food and supplies due to the German/Finnish siege. The 109th then participated in the offensive that drove the Germans away from the city in early 1944, helped drive Finland out of the war, and then joined the offensive along the Baltic coast towards Germany. This third formation compiled an admirable record of service, but was disbanded in 1946.  1st Formation  The first 109th Rifle Division began forming at Tatarsk in the Novosibirsk Oblast on April 15, 1939, based on a cadre provided by the 79th Rifle Regiment of the 73rd Rifle Division. Col. Nikolai Pavlovich Krasnoretzkiy was appointed to command on June 1, and he would hold that post through this formation's existence. In January, 1940, the division moved to Kharanor to be reorganized as the 109th Motorized Division.Charles C.

In December/January there was also a 2nd Rifle Division in the Arkhangelsk Military District. It consisted of, in part: * 381st Rifle Regiment - re-designated from the 1330th Rifle RegimentThe 1330th was formed in September, 1941, from the Odessa Militia Division to form part of the 421st Rifle Division. This half-formed division was evacuated from Odessa to the Crimea in October. Charles C.

Note that Forczyk states that the division was formed based on remnants of the 2nd Cavalry Division. Sharp states that 2nd Cavalry was almost entirely dismounted on arrival in Crimea, and was renamed 2nd Rifle on November 25, 1941; Sharp, \\"Red Sabers\\", Soviet Cavalry Corps, Divisions and Brigades 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. V, 1995, p. 38 It was part of the Separate Coastal Army, where it served for the duration of its existence. In the final defense of the Sevastopol Fortress, the 109th fought as part of the \\"First Sector\\", and its divisional commander, Maj. Gen. Pyotr Georgyevich Novikov, also served as the Sector commander. The division was tasked with the defense of the high ground that blocked German entry into Balaclava; in fact, the 456th Rifle Regiment held the same area where the British 93rd Highland Regiment made its famous \\"Thin Red Line\\" stand in October, 1854.Robert Forczyk, Where The Iron Crosses Grow, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, UK, 2014, pp. 194-95 In spite of directions from above, the commander of German XXX Army Corps began an attack on the 109th on June 7, 1942, as part of the overall final offensive against Sevastopol. 456th Rifle Regiment inflicted heavy casualties, in part through antiaircraft and sniper fire, while the 381st Regiment, initially taken by surprise, also threw back the enemy with heavy losses. After four more days of piecemeal attacks, the German corps had suffered over 1,000 casualties for no gains. A larger-scale offensive, with armor support, began on June 11, and captured Ruin Hill from the 602nd Regiment. Despite this the division continued to resist strongly; unfortunately the adjoining 388th Rifle Division defending the village of Kamary was not faring so well. Novikov decided to attempt to relieve one regiment of that division in place on the night of June 12/13, but this move was detected by the Germans who successfully launched an attack to disrupt it. Late in the afternoon of the 13th, with Soviet defenses in the center of the sector in disorder, a further German assault overwhelmed and routed the 602nd. While the rest of the division continued to hold firm, Novikov had no option but to pull his forces back 1,000 - 1,500 metres on June 16 roughly along the line of the Sapun Heights.Forczyk, Where the Iron Crosses Grow, pp. 196-200 A lull set in over the next few days, but on the night of June 28/29 German Eleventh Army launched its final assault all along the line. By the end of this disastrous day for the Soviet defenders the 109th was still relatively intact, but concentrated around Balaclava. Realizing he was about to be cut off, Novikov ordered his division to force-march toward Coastal Battery 35 on the Chersonese Peninsula, where he formed a defensive perimeter with about 50,000 men, mostly stragglers. He was handed command of the Separate Coastal Army on the 30th as the Soviet leadership fled; when he tried to follow in a sub-chaser on July 2 the ship was intercepted and sunk, and Novikov was captured. 456th Rifle Regiment made a last stand around Coastal Battery 18, but by the evening of July 4 all the remaining forces on the peninsula were destroyed or captured.Forczyk, Where the Iron Crosses Grow, pp. 205-13 The 109th Rifle Division was officially stricken from the Soviet order of battle on July 30.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 40  3rd Formation  The division was reformed on August 6, 1942 at Pulkovo in the 42nd Army of Leningrad Front from the 21st NKVD Rifle Division, which had been involved in the defense of the city for the previous twelve months.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, pp. 140, 163 Its partial order of battle became: * 381st Rifle Regiment - from the 6th NKVD Rifle Regiment * 456th Rifle Regiment - from the 8th NKVD Rifle Regiment * 602nd Rifle Regiment - from the 14th NKVD Rifle Regiment * 404th Artillery Regiment * 339th Antitank Battalion * 229th Sapper Battalion.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 40 Upon its redesignation the division was under the command of Col. Mikhail Danilovich Papchenko, but he was replaced within a week by Col. Nikolai Andreevich Trushkin. Trushkin was promoted to Major General on April 21, 1943, and remained in this post for most of the rest of the war. Just prior to its re-designation, between July 20‚Äì23, the division had taken part in an attack on the German-held fortified village of Staro-Panovo, southwest of the city, which succeeded in liberating the village and part of the adjoining Uritsk.Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad, 1941-1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA, 2002, pp. 214-15. Despite the date, Glantz identifies the division as the 109th. Although the gains were small, it was the first time the German siege lines had been pushed back and held, boosting the morale of the defenders.Iosef Pilyushin, Red Sniper on the Eastern Front, Pen & Sword Books, Ltd., Barnsley, UK, 2010, pp. 159-69 In the late autumn the division was relieved from front-line duty for nearly a month for rebuilding and replenishment, then was deployed again to the Pulkovo sector, now facing the Spanish Blue Division.Pilyushin, pp. 181-82 The Spanish were withdrawn from this sector on January 6, 1943, replaced by the German 23rd Infantry Division.Pilyushin, p. 184 The 109th became part (somewhat confusingly) of the 109th Rifle Corps from November, 1943, and remained in that Corps for the duration. In January, 1944, 109th Corps left 42nd Army and was transferred to the 2nd Shock ArmyCombat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 8, 35 in the Oranienbaum Bridgehead. Later that month 2nd Shock took a leading part in the offensive that finally drove the German forces away from Leningrad.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 40. Pilyushin's memoir mistakenly states that the division and corps engaged as part of 42nd Army during the offensive. In May, the 109th was transferred north to the 21st Army facing the Finnish forces in Karelia.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 40 The division helped to penetrate the second Finnish defensive belt on June 14, capturing several strongpoints; following this, it continued to advance on the right flank of its Army, reaching positions about 15 km east of Viipuri by July 15.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 428, 435 On June 22 the division was awarded the battle honor \\"Leningrad\\" as well as the Order of the Red Banner for its role in this campaign. With Finland out of the war, the 109th made its final transfer, to 8th Army in Estonia, near Narva, in August. Until the end of the war it assisted in clearing the Baltic coast as far as the Courland Peninsula. On several occasions the division served as a \\"follow-on\\" force in amphibious operations against German forces on the Baltic islands, but it never led an amphibious assault landing.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 40 On December 16, General Trushkin left command of the division to Col.

This approach suggests: * 1) a separation of the traits related to three aspects of activities: social-verbal, motor- physical and mental aspects of behaviour. In contrast to that, all other models of a structure of temperament describing an energetic dimension (for example, traits of Activity or Extraversion) do not differentiate between the traits regulating physical, social-verbal or mental activities. Yet, someone who enjoys performing prolonged and/or intense physical work might tire of social conversations very quickly. Likewise, a fast-talking person might not necessarily be able to manipulate objects swiftly or perform rapid mental calculations. * 2) an integration of the principle of habit formation in behavioural regulation into the structure of psychological individual differences (the principle was studied experimentally since the pioneering work of Nikolai Bernstein Bernstein's studies in kinesiology and then subsequent studies in neuroscience demonstrated that there is a transfer of control over construction of behaviour between several areas of the brain, depending on novelty and complexity of the tasks. Neurophysiological (cortical) systems regulating probabilistic aspects of actions gradually pass control to the \\"habit\\" systems (in basal ganglia when an individual learns the action or already has sufficient familiarity with the program of actions. The activity-specific approach differentiates between temperament traits related to several levels of complexity of behaviour Other models of personality and temperament did not differentiate between traits related to probabilistic and deterministic aspects of behavioural regulation. Meanwhile, it is well-known in neuroscience that behaviour in complex, probabilistic and novel situations is regulated by different (neocortex) systems than behaviour in well-learned or in simple situations (regulated more by basal ganglia). Rusalov demonstrated that this distinction is applicable to the structure of temperament. For example, when it comes to Endurance, Intellectual Endurance relates to capacities for prolonged mental activities whereas Physical (Motor) Endurance in his model relates to capacities for stereotypical, well-learned physical work. Similarly, the trait of Plasticity in Rusalov's model relates to activation of the frontal cortex controlling the ease of integration of new programs of actions whereas the trait of Tempo relates to the speed of integration of previously learned or simple actions.  History  This approach was developed within experimental psychophysiology in studies on adults only and therefore was not used in developmental psychology (in studies and practical applications of children's temperament). First known expression of this idea was in the work of Dodge, who studied mental fatigue. Dodge suggested that physical and mental efforts are regulated by different nervous processes. This idea was verbalized again by Vladimir Nebylitsyn, then further developed in differential psychology and psychophysiology experiments from the late 1970s by Rusalov, who was working in Nebylitsyn's laboratory and inherited this laboratory after a sudden tragic death of Nebylitsyn ). Rusalov proposed activity-specific theory of temperament, which was further developed by his graduate student Trofimova in her Compact version of the Structure of Temperament Questionnaire. The idea of the structure of temperament separating the traits related to social-verbal, motor-physical and mental aspects of behavior was incorporated by Trofimova in the neurochemical model Functional Ensemble of Temperament that links the relationships between monoamine neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and hormonal systems to the 12 temperament traits.  Models of temperament within the activity-specific approach =Rusalov\`s (STQ-150) (electro-physiological) model= Vladimir Rusalov, who continued the line in research in the Laboratory of Differential Psychophysiology (Institute of Psychology of Russian Academy of Sciences) started by Nebylitsyn and Teplov, recorded EEGs and measured evoked potential, absolute threshold in visual, auditory, and tactile modalities, strength of excitation and mobility in auditory and visual modalities, problem solving in deterministic and probabilistic conditions, endurance in solving the tasks, and the speed of solving a variety of tests. Rusalov concluded that temperament traits are activity-specific, i.e. traits regulating physical, social-verbal and intellectual aspects of behaviour are based on different neurophysiological systems. He showed that an energetic level or tempo of performance might differ for the same individual when he/she is solving three different types of tasks (physical, verbal or intellectual. Rusalov suggested, therefore, that individual differences in these three types of activities should be assessed and analyzed using separate scales. Rusalov's activity-specific model of the structure of temperament Rusalov's model suggests that the structure of temperament can be presented as 12 traits: 4 aspects of behaviour (ergonicity (endurance), plasticity, tempo and emotionality), which are grouped by three aspects of behavior: motor-physical, social-verbal and intellectual. This model was incorporated in the extended Structure of Temperament Questionnaire. The factor analysis of the data received on Russian, Australian, American, Canadian, Urdu-Canadian, Polish- Canadian and Chinese samples confirmed a separation between the factors related to these three aspects of behavior. =Compact STQ-77 (neuro-chemical) model= Trofimova, who was doing her PhD in Rusalov's lab in the early 1990s suggested that the trait of impulsivity reflects the speed of initiation of immature (emotionality-based) behavioural response, whereas Tempo and Plasticity relate to the speed of more integrated behavioural response. She suggested therefore that all three traits relate to the speed of an integration of an action. Her alternative activity-specific model of temperament included Empathy and Sensation seeking as orientation-related traits and also suggested a re-arrangement of Emotionality traits. The STQ-77 model is therefore based on Rusalov's model and also on Luria‚Äôs theory related to three neuroanatomic systems (sensory-informational, programming and energetic) regulating human behavior. This model first appeared as an architecture of the Compact version of the Structure of Temperament Questionnaire (STQ-77) in 2007. The factor analysis of the STQ-77 data received on Russian and Canadian samples confirmed a separation between the factors related to motor-physical, social-verbal and mental aspects of behaviour. Subsequently Trofimova reviewed studies in neurophysiology, neurochemistry, clinical psychology and kinesiology and linked functionality of neurotransmitters to the 12 traits of the STQ-77 model in a framework of a neurochemical model Functional Ensemble of Temperament Trofimova‚Äôs model of the structure of temperament (‚ÄúFunctional Ensemble of Temperament\\") The differences between Rusalov's and Trofimova's models are: * the choice of a grouping of temperament traits by dynamical aspects (endurance, speed of integration and orientation), presented as three columns in the Figure; * a presence of orientation-related traits in Trofimova's model which were not included in Rusalov's model. These traits describe the behavioural orientation of a person with preferences to specific types of reinforcers: sensations (Sensation Seeking), other people's state (Empathy) or knowledge about causes of natural processes (a trait named as Sensitivity to Probabilities). * a different structure of the traits related to emotionality. FET considers emotionality traits as systems amplifying three dynamical aspects of behaviour presented in the three columns of the model. Amplification of orientation aspects emerges in the trait of Neuroticism; amplification of speed of integration (i.e. immature integration) emerges as Impulsivity and amplification of subjective feeling of energetic capacities emerges in the trait of Self-confidence. Both models differentiate between physical and verbal-social aspects of well-determined activities (2 middle rows, 6 traits), and consider the traits related to the mental, intellectual aspects of activities (3 top traits of the FET model) as traits regulating behaviour in probabilistic, complex situations. Such differentiation is in line with the neuroanatomic localization of control over motor coordination (via parietal cortex), verbal functions (via left temporal cortex) and mental functions (via frontal cortex). Comparison to other models of temperament  Previous models of a structure of temperament did not distinguish among the traits regulating behaviour in different areas of activity. They consider, for example, energetic capacities in motor and social activities (extraversion or Strength of the nervous system) as based on a nonspecific general arousal of the nervous system. Many models of temperament and personality follow a so- called \\"general arousal\\" approach, considering only one general trait related to the energetic component of behaviour: \\"strength of excitation\\" (Pavlov, Jan Strelau) \\"liveliness\\", ‚Äúvigilance‚Äù (Cattell), extraversion (Eysenck, Five- Factor model in personality), \\"activity\\" (Heymans, Buss & Plomin, 1984; Rothbart, et al., 2000), approach behavioural system (Gray), drive persistence (Telegen, 1985) or just \\"arousal\\"\\"(Mehrabian, 1996). However, it appears \\"obvious\\" that a person who, for example, exhibits ability for long and intense communication is not necessarily able to sustain long and intense physical or mental work. Moreover, early temperament models (offered by Pavlov, Eysenck, Gray) were originally developed through animal studies under relatively deterministic conditions using insensitive statistical methods that could not explain individual differences in complex probabilistic human behavior. These models therefore missed the social and mental specifics of human activities. The activity-specific approach suggested that the separate regulation of mental and physical activities within the nervous system should be reflected in a separation of traits related to different aspects of behaviour. This meant that animal models of temperament should be upgraded with the traits related to specifics of human activities. Yet, here is an overlap of the temperament traits described within the Activity-specific and alternative models of temperament: * Temperament traits of the FET model reflecting three formal-dynamical aspects of behaviour (energetic, dynamic/speed of integration, and orientational) are in line with the separation between energetic and mobility traits of temperament in experiments of the Pavlovian tradition (Pavlov, Teplov & Nebylitsyn, Rusalov, Strelau). * Regulatory traits of directionality/orientation described by the FET model are line with Jung's theory of Introversion and Extraversion. This theory describes first type as sensitivity, behavioural orientation to internal thinking (an analog of FET trait of Sensitivity to Probabilities) whereas the second Jungian type describes orientation to socialization with other people, or social type of sensitivity. FET model borrowed the idea about a biologically-based trait of Sensation seeking from Zuckerman\`s concept of Sensation seeking (1994). The analogs of the temperament traits of Empathy and Sensation Seeking within the STQ-77/FET model were described by Eysenck and Eysenck (1985) as \\"toughmindedness\\" and \\"non-conformity\\" (facets of the Psychoticism factor); Cloninger (et al., 1994) (\\"novelty seeking\\"); S. Eysenck (1985) (\\"venturesomeness\\" and \\"empathy\\"), Taylor and Morrison (1992) (\\"sympathetic-indifferent\\", \\"responsive-inhibited\\", \\"subjective-objective\\"), Rothbart, Ahadi, and Evans (2000) (\\"orienting sensitivity\\"), and Baron-Cohen (2003) (\\"systemizing\\" and \\"empathizing\\"). * Similar to the FET model, several other temperament models included traits related to social activities that were separated from those related to physical (general) activities. The second version of Eysenck‚Äôs Extraversion scale of the EPI separated Sociability (as the energetic component of social activities) and Impulsivity items. In 1985, Eysenck and Eysenck upgraded their 2-factor model (extraversion and neuroticism), adding Psychoticism as a temperamental trait describing issues of compliance with social expectations. This model was again upgraded to the Eysenck Personality Profiler (EPP), which had 21 sub-traits grouped into the 3 initial Eysenck factors (1995). Buss and Plomin‚Äôs temperament study with infants was based on the EAS model, which included Activity and Sociability as separate factors (Buss & Plomin, 1984), and the same separation was offered in Zuckerman (2002) 5-factor model. Mehrabian (1996) offered a three-dimensional temperament model, which in addition to the two basic dimensions of \\"Arousal\\" and \\"Pleasure-Displeasure\\" (emotionality) had a dimension describing social behaviour as \\"Dominance-Submissiveness\\". Similar dimensions (Social activity and Dominance-Submissiveness) were used by Taylor and Morrison (1992). * temperament traits regulating behaviour at two levels of situational emergency, associated with different degree of emotional response are classically described as two groups: Emotionality and Activity/Energy. Combination of two extremes in these two basic dimensions were used to explain Hippocrates-Galen' four classic temperament types since the end of the 18th century, in the work of Kant, Heymans, Wundt, Stern, Pavlov, Adler, Stranger, Lasursky, Kretschmer and Sheldon. After the functions of the ARAS and limbic systems were linked to physical and emotional arousal, Eysenck named this golden pair as 'Extraversion' and 'Neuroticism', followed by Thayer, Watson and Tellegen and the Big Five model of personality. Two emotional dispositions, Neuroticism and Self-Confidence were described from the 1970-80s in a number of Approach/Withdrawal (A/W) models (Akiskal, Gray, Simonov, Thomas & Chess, Windle & Lerner). Similarly to this approach, other models also described at least three levels of control. For example, Ortony, Norman, and Revelle differentiated between ‚Äúreactive‚Äù (by analogy with Emotionality traits), ‚Äúroutine‚Äù (by analogy with ‚Äúdeterministic‚Äù, or well-learned traits) and ‚Äúreflective‚Äù (by analogy with ‚Äúcontextual‚Äù, or ‚Äúprobabilistic‚Äù traits) levels of behavioural regulation. Critiques and upgrades The benefits of activity-specific approach of Rusalov's model of temperament do not mean, however, that this model is complete. Several factor analytic studies of the STQ consistently showed that the three Emotionality scales of the STQ (Motor Emotionality, Social Emotionality and Intellectual Emotionality) were not as activity-specific as the Ergonicity (endurance), Plasticity and Tempo scales and basically constituted one factor Trofimova suggested that Rusalov's 12-trait temperament model can be re-worked into another 12-trait temperament model that unifies the former Rusalov's three traits of Emotionality in one dimension of neuroticism. Moreover, Trofimova pointed out that intellectual activity uses analytic differentiation of contextual information whereas a tempo of activity uses more explicit, readily available and well-defined behavioural elements. For this reason, the scale of Intellectual Tempo within Rusalov's model might reflect a tempo of pre-learned cognitive elements but not an analytic activity. Trofimova suggested that only the scales of only Motor and Social-verbal Tempo (but Intellectual Tempo) should stay in the model whereas the speed of generation of less-defined behavioural integration should be called Plasticity. By the same logic, Motor and Social Plasticity represent manipulation of well-defined behavioural elements and these traits describe therefore tempo- and not plasticity-related aspects. For this reason Trofimova suggested to consider only one and not three types of Plasticity and two types of Tempo. Rusalov's model was also missing the scales of Impulsivity, Self-Confidence, sensation seeking, and empathy ‚Äì but these scales were added in the STQ-77 and the Functional Ensemble of Temperament model. Applications  Activity-specific approach in temperament was employed in: * organizational psychology in vocational assessments related to recommended placement of staff and fitness for various jobs. * clinical psychology as a framework for new versions of DSM or ICD. Clinical studies conducted the FET/STQ-77 models showed that the activity-specific model of temperament matches the structure of symptoms of mental disorders described in main classifications much better than other temperament models, and is capable of differentiating between anxiety and depression * differential psychology and general psychological assessment of most consistent, biologically based traits.

Early life and education  Zalewski was born on 25 August 1917 to a Polish family settled in Samgorodek, Ukraine since the seventeenth century. He took part in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 in Czerniak√≥w. Went to Tadeusz Czacki High School in Warsaw, where he was in the same graduating class as the poet priest Jan Twardowski. In 1947 he graduated from Warsaw University of Technology, which he began before the war, eventually graduating from the Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology. Career He has designed a whole range of new industrial construction.

He wrote the book Shaping Structures with Ed Allen. Among others streams forces were introduced as a method for the calculation of the structure. He retained his connections in Venezuela for many years, however, and continued to design structures there during academic holidays and sabbaticals.

Philadelphia Magazine, p. 36. Her figurative work serves as a metaphor for exploring her life experience, and she uses people, places, and objects closest to her to convey ongoing themes.. Constantine is the recipient of numerous awards, including a Certificate of Excellence from the Portrait Society of America, five awards from the Woodmere Art Museum in Pennsylvania, and one from the Allied Artists of America in NYC. Her work has been exhibited in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts Museum, Philadelphia City Hall, the National Arts League in New York City, and the Woodmere Art Museum in Chestnut Hill, PA. Three of her paintings were featured in Alla Prima: A Contemporary Guide to Traditional Direct Painting, published in 2009 by Watson-Guptil, NY. Her painting \\"Self Portrait with a Man\\" was purchased by The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine arts for their permanent collection in December 2018. Constantine holds a certificate in Painting from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and lives and works in Center City, Philadelphia. Biography Rachel Constantine was born in Philadelphia in 1973. In 2003, she received a certificate in Painting from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where she graduated with honors. Since then, she has participated in almost 50 exhibitions, won five awards from the Woodmere Art Museum in Pennsylvania, a Certificate of Excellence from the Portrait Society of America, eleven awards from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and another from Allied Artists for America in New York City. In 2006, Constantine was invited to exhibit in Artworks Gallery at the Philadelphia Museum of Art as the local complement to the Museum's exhibition: Wyeth: Memory and Magic. Her work can be found in The Vivian O. and Meyer P. Potamkin Collection in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and is featured in the new hard-cover illustrated book Alla Prima: A Contemporary Guide to Traditional Direct Painting written by Al Gury, the chairman of the Pennsylvania Academy's painting department. Education The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, PA *: Graduated with 4-year Certificate in Painting (1999‚Äì2003) * Fleisher Art Memorial, Philadelphia, PA *: Classes in Drawing, Printmaking and Ceramics * The University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA *: Majored in Painting (1991‚Äì1993) Works In her Monument (2006), Constantine explores themes that are at once personal and timeless. The composition alludes both to the symbolic nature morte of the Baroque era and to the still lifes of Chardin. Her own sensibility adds poetry as well as an edge of modern anxiety and sadness. In her Swan Pond (2002), the amount of thinner, oil, and so forth added to the paint has a profound effect on the quality of the brush calligraphy and the details in a painting. Broad, scumbled masses provide the setting for paint that has varying degrees of oil added to it. The gazebo, water reflection, and swans achieve their clarity because they are rendered with brushstrokes that are more thickly loaded with paint and also because that paint has a small amount of oil added. This follows the \\"lean to fat\\" concept of layering. The \\"fatter\\" final, detail touches sit on top with clarity due to the added oil, which created a sharper edge over the less oily paint beneath. =Beyond the Surface= Constantine made her curatorial debut at the Principle Gallery in Alexandria, Virginia, with Beyond the Surface, a group show featuring work from realist artist who include conceptual elements in their work along with their high levels of technical mastery. Artists chosen by Constantine include Daniel Sprick, Mario Robinson, Charles Morris, Rose Frantzen, Stephen Layne, Amy Kann, Renee Foulks, Stephen Early, and Stephen Cefalo.\\"American Art Collector,\\" (2013, November). Beyond the Surface, p. 156. =Interview= Constantine's projects are typically sparked by a particular quality that she observes in someone that she feels compelled to try to capture and translate visually. She almost always paints people she knows because she prefers to have that emotional connection going in. Constantine says, \\"my paintings don't necessarily aim to be \\"about\\" the person I'm working with; it's the characteristics of the individual that I try to use as a vehicle to express larger concepts. Typically, I'll bring subject into my studio, try my best to get them to relax and not \\"model,\\" and then photograph them in an attempt to achieve a specific pose that speaks to me. I try to have as few preconceptions as possible at this point, because my whole goal is to capture a \\"found moment.\\" Once the pose is set, I bring the model back for sittings, as needed.\\" Constantine thinks that classical painting is all about light; she finds in her own work that a piece's success often rises and falls according to the accuracy of its depiction. she says, \\"in learning to paint light, one learns to capture emotion. That's why I rarely use artificial light sources; there's a limitlessness about the color and range of natural light that artificial light just can't reproduce. To my thinking, color in and of itself does not make art. There's form, function and foundation there, it's one thing to say something's beautiful- because there's beauty in almost everything, if you take the time to stop and really look hard enough- but it's another to call it a work of art. So I tend to admire painters who are strong draftsmen first.\\" Menendez, D. (2009). Poets and Artists (Vol. 2).

The book was officially released on 15 April 2014. The book deals with the issue of irregularities in the determination of the price of natural gas in India. Overview In the book, the authors claim to cover all the issues regarding the extraction of natural gas from the Krishna Godavari Basin. After a few publishers refused to accept the book unmodified, the Guha Thakurta decided to self-publish it. He choose the internet as the primary mode of distribution to avoid facing litigation, like those faced by the publishers of The Descent of Air India and Sahara: The Untold Story. The book covers the various important aspect on the gas drilling in Krishna Godavari Basin. It also covers the legal dispute between Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani over the pricing of gas supply between their two firms. It discusses technical issues of deep-sea drilling. It also includes an investigative report prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) of the alleged malpractices of Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL). The books also claims the political system of India has created crony capitalism in India. It claims that in sectors like infrastructure and energy, a few firms are getting project deals in exchange for political contribution. The book claims the CAG report states that the government prepared contracts that were favourable to RIL and the Prime Minister changed Petroleum Ministers to favour the firm. Defamation notice On 17 April 2014, Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) sent a legal notice to the authors and the publishers. The notice claimed that the firm and its chairman were being defamed for personal gain. The notice also accused the distributors of the ebook version, Flipkart and Amazon, of conspiracy. Deepshikha Shankar, an event manager, who sent out the invitations for the book release was also accused by the notice. The notice claimed that the book was in contempt of the Supreme Court of India as a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) regarding the Krishna Godavari Basin is still pending in the court. The notice alleged that the book has tried to create a negative image of the firm when the lawsuit is still under arbitration. The notice demanded that the sales of the book be stopped and all existing copies in all forms be destroyed. The notice also demanded a public apology and threatened litigation if their demands were not met. Guha Thakurta responded to the notice by saying that the book was balanced as it quoted RIL's version of the events too. He mentioned that it also included interviews with RIL personnel like B. K. Ganguly. He said that the authors were exercising their right to free expression under the Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. He added that this was an act of intimidation and harassment and they will apply a proper legal response. On 23 April 2014, RIL sent another legal notice to authors and distributors seeking crore in damages, to be paid within 10 days of the notice.

The practice was founded in 2006 by Matthew Trzebiatowski, AIA. The work of Blank Studio Architecture has been compared to the likes of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe because of their use of material and volume. Their works focus on the sensual qualities found in architecture, such as interplay of natural and artificial illumination, and unconventional uses of material. Projects consistently display a phenomenological approach to design. The studio has partnered with University of Arizona and The School of Architecture at Taliesin to provide students with the opportunity to learn about the study of architecture through practice.

A.J. Dijksterhuis, 1968 - at the UvA Album Academicum website. is a Dutch Social Psychologist at Radboud University Nijmegen. He received his Ph.D in Social Sciences from Radboud University Nijmegen in 1996. His adviser was Ad van Knippenberg. From 1996-1999, he did post-doc work as a Research Fellow of the Royal Dutch Academy of Arts and Sciences, located in Amsterdam. In 2000, he became a professor at the University of Amsterdam, returning to Radboud University Nijmegen in 2006. In 2007, his first book was published, in Dutch, called ‚ÄòHet slimme onbewuste‚Äô (‚ÄòThe Smart Unconscious‚Äô). Awards2005- APA Award for Early Career Contributions *2005- EAESP Kurt Lewin Award *2007- SPSP Theoretical Innovation Award Research His areas of research have varied, but all deal with unconscious: the perception-behavior link, goals, Implicit Self Esteem Issues, and unconscious thought. He works & co-leads the Unconscious lab at Radboud University Nijmegen, with Rick van Baaren. The lab‚Äôs primary focus is on unconscious thought and imitation. His theory that certain behaviour can be modified by unconscious cues is somewhat controversial.Alison Abbott, Disputed results a fresh blow for social psychology, Nature, 30 April 2013. =Perception-Behavior link (1995‚Äì2001)= Bargh, Chen, and Burrows showed a relationship between activation of traits and behavior. In one of the experiments they primed participants with words related to the elderly and found they walked slower leaving the experiment than controls. Dijksterhuis started investigating the link between perception and behavior, but instead of direct behavior he wanted to measure ability. Over multiple studies, Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg primed subjects with the stereotype of professor (thought of as intelligent), and the stereotype of soccer hooligans (thought of as stupid). In the last study, they also primed them directly with intelligent or stupid, rather than just using a stereotype. In a supposedly unrelated task, they used a general knowledge measure to test for effects of the priming. In all of the studies, participants primed with intelligence, by stereotype or directly, did better than controls. The opposite is true for those primed with stupidity. The duration of priming (9 minutes vs 2 minutes) affected performance with those in the long condition performing better than those in the short condition. These results have been called into question due to failure of multiple researchers to replicate. =Implicit self-esteem (2000‚Äìpresent)= Much work has been done on measuring self-esteem. More recently, there has been a focus on implicit self-esteem, and how to measure it. According to Bosson, Swann, and Pennebaker there is little to no correlation between several previously used implicit self-esteem measures. The same results were found when comparing implicit and explicit measures. Dijksterhuis acknowledges this limitation and tries to work around it by manipulating implicit self-esteem then measuring it with the name-letter effect or self-esteem IAT. In the experiments, he uses evaluative conditioning to enhance implicit self-esteem subconsciously. The word ‚ÄòI‚Äô was subliminally presented (15 milliseconds) followed by either positive traits (e.g. smart) or neutral words (e.g. chair), depending on the condition. Evaluative conditioning is most often used to change attitude towards a neutral stimuli, but he proposed it would work for implicit self-esteem. The results support his hypothesis; participants in the experimental condition showed higher levels of implicit self-esteem on both measures compared to controls. Greenwald and Banaji‚Äôs definition of implicit self-esteem is: ‚Äúimplicit self- esteem is the introspectively unidentified (or inaccurately identified) effect of the self-attitude on evaluation of self-associated and self-dissociated objects‚Äù. Dijksterhuis proposes an alternate definition that self-esteem is the attitude and that the evaluation of objects is a consequence of this attitude. He also proposes that the different measures have not correlated with each other because they are either measuring the attitude towards self or the consequence of this attitude. =Unconscious Thought Theory (UTT) (2002‚Äìpresent)= Unconscious thought theory (UTT) was introduced by Dijksterhuis in 2004. He presented 5 experiments showing that people make better decisions when they thought about it unconsciously rather than consciously. The argument is that conscious thought is not capable of handling all the complex information that we need to process in order to make good decisions. In experiment 2 participants in the conscious thought condition reported only using a subset of the information provided to make their decision. In a 2006 paper, Dijksterhuis and colleagues did multiple studies looking at making the best choices. In the first study, participants were shown 4 (simple) or 12 (complex) attributes, randomized one at a time, about four fake cars. The attributes were either positive or negative. Two of the cars had equal numbers of positive and negative attributes, one was presented with 75% positive attributes, and the other 25%. After the attributes were shown participants were told they would have to pick the best car. Half the participants were allowed to think about the cars for 4 minutes (conscious thought condition) the other half were distracted for those 4 minutes solving anagrams (unconscious thought condition). After the 4 minutes everyone chose the best car and participants in the simple condition made better decisions in the conscious thought condition, but unconscious thought led to better decisions in the complex condition. Other studies are presented in the article applying this same design to the real world decisions (e.g. department store vs a furniture store). Dijksterhuis wanted to get away from the artificial information that people are provided in a laboratory setting and see what happens when they have to rely on their own knowledge about a subject to make decisions. Dijksterhuis and colleagues designed an experiment where subjects had to rate their level of expertise on soccer, then pick win, lose, or draw for four upcoming soccer matches in the Dutch league. Participants were placed in one of the following conditions: choose within 20 seconds of seeing the matches, given two minutes to deliberate (conscious), or distracted for two minutes (unconscious), then asked to choose. Results show that nonexperts do about as well in all conditions but experts perform better in the unconscious thought condition. They replicated the study using World Cup matches since there is a more objective way to measure expertise with national team world ranking rather than asking participants to self-report expertise. The pattern of results was similar to the first study.

Arthur George Stephenson  Sir Arthur George Stephenson (1890‚Äì1967), architect, born in 1890 at Box Hill, Victoria. In 1907 Stephenson worked for Swansson Brothers while studying construction at the Working Men‚Äôs College. He joined the Australian Imperial Force in 1915 as a lieutenant, promoted to captain and awarded the Military Cross. After WWI, Stephenson remained in London and studied at the Architectural Association School (AA) and joined the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1920. He returned to Melbourne and formed a partnership with Percy Hayman Meldrum in 1921, known as Stephenson & Meldrum. Stephenson was largely responsible for the firm‚Äôs direction to specialize in hospital design. He also lectured, wrote widely and was a member of numerous committees, including the International Hospitals Federation, the Hospital Advisory Council (Melbourne) and a trustee of the National Museum of Victoria.Philip Goad and others: Australian Modern: The Architecture of Stephenson and Turner, The Miegunyah Press and the State Library of Victoria, 2004. In 1954 Stephenson was knighted for services to architecture and was the first Australian to receive a RIBA Gold Medal in 1964. The Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) awarded him a Gold Medal in 1963 and was made honorary fellow by The American Institute of Architects in 1964.  Percy Meldrum  Percy Hayman Meldrum (1887‚Äì1968), architect, born in 1887 at Casterton, Victoria and educated at Ballarat College. In 1907 he studied architecture and articled to Melbourne Architect A. A. Fritsch from 1907 until 1913, where he won the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects Bronze Medal. In 1913 Meldrum travelled to Chicago and admired the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright. Then travelled to England in 1914 and worked with the War Office designing aircraft hangars. In 1919 Meldrum joined the AA, where he met and taught Arthur Stephenson and Donald Turner. A fine draftsman and watercolorist, Meldrum was the artistic director and collaborated with some of Melbourne‚Äôs prominent artists, including Napier Waller, whose mosaic featured on the fa√ßade of the Newspaper House in Melbourne (1933). Stephenson and Meldrum‚Äôs partnership ended in 1937, with Meldrum moving on to practice with Arthur Noad, to form Meldrum and Noad.  Donald Turner  Donald Turner (1895‚Äì1964), architect, was born at Maitland, NSW. He began his architectural career as a student with Ross & Rowe in 1912. In 1915 he enlisted in the First All and served as captain until 1919 with the Field Artillery in Egypt and France. After WWI he also studied at the AA in London where he met Arthur Stephenson and Percy Meldrum. Turner joined the RIBA in 1921 and was appointed assistant architect for the Imperial War Graves Commission. Returning to Melbourne in 1924, he joined Stephenson and Meldrum and was promoted to director in 1936. With Meldrum‚Äôs departure in 1937 the firm‚Äôs name changed to become Stephenson and Turner in 1938.  Projects  = Hospitals = 300x300px Stephenson‚Äôs firm designed most of the major hospitals built in Australia in the 1930s.Fisher, J.D., Australian Dictionary of Biography: Stephenson, Sir Arthur George (1890‚Äì1967), [adb.anu.edu.au/biography/stephenson-sir-arthur-george-8646)]. Robin Boyd wrote in his book, Victorian Modern (1947), ‚Äúhospitals gave modern architecture in Australia its first big break‚Äù.Shaw, Sir Arthur Stephenson: Australian Architect, 85. The early 20th century saw advancements in medical technology and treatments, which transformed hospitals into a symbol of modern and healthy society.Julie Willis, Machines for healing, Architecture Australia, July/August 2002, 46. Stephenson took full advantage of this and traveled to America in 1926-7 to research the most modern developments in hospital design and equipment. They immediately embarked on a number of hospital commissions, such as the Wangaratta Base Hospital, the Jesse McPherson wing of the Queen Victoria Hospital then located in William Street, and a large campus for 'crippled children' for the children's hospital at Somers. The firm‚Äôs first major city hospital commission was the Healy Wing at St Vincent‚Äôs Hospital in Fitzroy, where Stephenson provided efficient planning and accommodation of modern medical technology. All these hospitals were designed in eclectic styles typical of American hospitals, St Vincent's being the most adventurous - the design of 1928 was a massive block with arched windows at each end and columns columns flanking the entrance, a design which evolved when it was finally built in 1931-34 taking on some more Art Deco characteristics of a stepped skyscraper profile and patterned brickwork that varied from dark at the base to light on the top stories. 300x300px It wasn't until after Stephenson‚Äôs second research trip in 1932‚Äì33 to continental Europe that hospital design in Australia drastically changed. Stephenson was inspired by European Modernism, particularly Bijvoet and Duiker‚Äôs Zonnestraal Sanatorium (1928) in the Netherlands, and the Paimio Sanatorium (1929‚Äì33) in Finland by Alvar Aalto, which Stephenson described as a way ‚Äúto express in the simplest form the function of the building in the most appropriate materials\\". Their next project, the Mercy Hospital (1934), introduced a completely new aesthetic : a six level reinforced concrete building with stark white sweeping cantilevered balconies that allowed for sun control and outdoor space for patients. The efficiency of the design was described by Professor John Freeland as ‚Äúclean-cut with the precision of a machine‚Äù.John Shaw, Sir Arthur Stephenson: Australian Architect, The Stephenson & Turner Sydney/Hong Kong Group, 1987, 86. 300x300px 408x408px The success of the Mercy was followed by a succession of hospital commissions in Australia for Stephenson and Meldrum (replaced by Turner in 1937), most featuring long sweeping horizontal balconies with curved corners on a body of cream brick, a streamlined ‚Äòfunctionalist‚Äô idiom. The Freemason‚Äôs Hospital (1936) in East Melbourne, defined by its horizontal balconies, was followed by the tall wedge-shaped United Dental Hospital (1940) in Sydney, and the rectilinear Pathology Block at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne in 1941. In 1936 they began designing the new The Royal Melbourne Hospital in Parkville, completed in 1942, which served as an American military hospital during WWII (returned to civilian use in 1944). The front fa√ßade design departed from the sweeping horizontality that Stephenson‚Äôs hospitals were known for; instead they opted for a simple and pared back International Style, though the rear facade did include their signature sweeping white horizontal balconies. While work on the Royal Melbourne Hospital was underway, they also designed for Sydney the King George V Hospital for Mothers and Babies (1939-41), which features the sweeping horizontal balconies on the front facades, and the Concord Repatriation Hospital, completed in 1942, which repeated the design of the Royal Melbourne, with a plain front dominated by a tower elements, and the sweeping balconies on the rear, but more visible than on the tight Melbourne site. = International Expositions = Stephenson and Turner designed the Australian pavilions at three international exhibitions, which demonstrated both his commitment to Modernism and the firms status. The Australian pavilion at the International Exposition of Arts & Technology in Modern Life in Paris (1937), was a stark cylinder, while the Australian Pavilion at the New Zealand Centennial Exhibition in Wellington, NZ in 1940, was an essay in intersecting volumes, with a bold stylised classical portico. The 1939 / 1940 New York World‚Äôs Fair work was an interior design only, as it was an attached wing of the British Pavilion (Stanley Hall & Easton and Robertson) and was noted for collaborations with artists and photographers to create a dynamic modern experience; the United States honoured Stephenson with citizenship for his work. = After WW2 = Stephenson and Turner were closely involved in the post-war manufacturing revolution in Australia, designing plants for Holden ‚Äì General Motors plant in Dandenong, Ford, BHP, Fibremakers as well as Australia‚Äôs first experimental nuclear reactor in Lucas Heights for the Atomic Energy Commission. They applied the same rigorous approach to researching and engaging with state of the art technologies and methods of manufacturing. Their design for the Holden Factory complex (1954‚Äì56) in Dandenong featured a completely functionalist curtain wall system. As well as major buildings in every capital city in Australia, in New Zealand and a hospital in Basra, Iraq, Stephenson and Turner grew to become the largest Australian architecture firm at its time with 300 ‚Äì 400 staff at its peak. They opened offices internationally in Singapore (1949), New Zealand (1956) and Hong Kong. Stephenson and Turner were one of the many architectural firms that were hit hard by the global economic downturn during the mid 1980s and merged with John Castles to become Castles, Stephenson and Turner in 1995. Since 2000, all Australian operations have closed down, with offices operating in New Zealand since 1956. Today Stephenson & Turner operates out of 5 bases in New Zealand, specialising in social infrastructure buildings and carrying on its heritage in healthcare architecture.

Sri Pattnaik arrived in Kujendri in 1940. Constructive work Sri Pattnaik joined the movement for the formation of a separate Utkal state. He started his work in Banabasi Seva Samiti\\"Banabasi seva samiti\\" (founded by Sri Gopabandhu Choudhury in 1972) and took up issues like education and upliftment of the poor tribesmen. The Samiti started running several residential schools for the tribal children, orphanages and old age homes. He made Khadi so popular in Koraput that he was called Koraputia Gandhi.\\"The Hindu\\" An article in the Hindu His fight against untouchability continued.

The person focusses his or her eyes closer than needed for the image produced by the instrument. Characteristics Ordinarily, when someone looks at an object at, say, one meter from the eyes, the eyes make reflex adjustments so the object appears single and clear.Duke-Elder, S. (1973). System of ophthalmology London: Henry Kimpton. That is, the eyes converge on the object, to bring its image in each eye onto the central part of each retina, the fovea. This ensures that the person sees one object instead of two, and is referred to as singleness of vision or binocular fusion. The focussing of each eye, its accommodation, is adjusted so the retinal image of the object is as sharp as possible. This is done via contraction of the ciliary muscles controlling the shape of the crystalline lens of the eye. Although convergence and accommodation are separate processes, they normally operate synergistically. When someone looks into an optical instrument, such as a microscope, vision is far from ordinary. A microscope might force the person to use only one eye, it presents the person with a limited field of view, it presents a magnified view, and it allows the person to adjust the focus of the instrument for any viewing distance. Ideally, the person will choose a focus adjustment on the instrument that allows the eyes to have relaxed accommodation‚Äîthat is to present the objects at a distance of about 6 meters, or optical infinity. However, most people tend to accommodate to nearer than 6 m. It is this too-close focussing of the eyes that is instrument myopia. Accommodating to a distance nearer than 6 meters makes the ciliary muscles work harder than they need to, leading to fatigue. Some binocular microscopes are designed so that the vergence of the eyes is correct for a 6-meter viewing distance. Accommodating to a closer distance will tend to converge the eyes, leading to double vision. According to Wesner and Miller (1986), instrument myopia is promoted when the viewing is with one eye, when the field of view is small, and when the luminance is low, concluding that these are consistent with accommodation's going towards a person's dark focus, which is about one meter from the eyes. Wesner and Miller also said it is possible that a person's knowledge that the viewed object is very close (on the microscope stage) contributes to instrument myopia. They said that instrument myopia is minimised by using a binocular microscope that forces the person's vergence angle to be small. History It is unknown by whom instrument myopia was first reported.

Traditionally, a young person would make use of the services of a khatba when their family and friends were unable to find a suitable mate. Their services are especially necessary outside of Egypt's large cities, in more traditional Islamic areas, where male and female youths are not permitted to mingle freely. In these areas, khatbas are typically paid for their services with non-monetary goods or services, such as gifts or favors. In popular media, khatbas are often represented as modestly- dressed middle-aged women, who carry photographs of marriageable youths to display to their clients. Although they are considered a stereotypical figure of the 1940s to mid-1960s, many modern Egyptian youth still employ khatbas in one form or another.

During his early life, he primarily worked on his family's farm and at local hardware dealership. In 1861, upon the outbreak of the Civil War, Healely joined the army for reasons of patriotism. He claimed that anyone who did not take up arms against the South was a rebel. In 1863, Healey was wounded in the head by a ball during a skirmish with Confederate forces in Tennessee. He survived the injury, but permanently lost his vision in his left eye. Battle of Brown's Mill In July 1864, Healey, under the command of General Edward M. McCook, was led into Georgia in an attempt to disrupt rail supplies and traffic. On July 29, was separated from his unit during an encounter with Confederate forces. Healey discovered a lone Confederate soldier and succeeded in capturing him and his firearm. Healey, joined by Private Martin, another displaced Union soldier, captured four more Confederates who had been trailing them. McCook's invasion of Georgia was ultimately a failure, and many of his soldiers, including Healey, were captured. Healey was ultimately sent to Andersonville Prison. Citation Later life Healely survived his capture and stay at Andersonville. In 1868, he married May Moser. He also worked at the Doolittle & Chamberlain business as a bookkeeper and salesmen. He later became a partner in the business and expanded it greatly. Healey died in 1913.

The concept of local inverse came from interior reconstruction of the CT image. One of the interior reconstruction methods was done through that first approximately reconstructs the image outside the ROI (region of interest) and then subtracts the re-projection data of the image at outside the ROI from the original projection data; then the above created data are used to make a new reconstruction. This idea can be widened to inverse. Instead of directly making an inverse, the unknowns at the outside of the local region can be first inverted. Recalculate the data from these unknowns (at outside the local region). Subtract this recalculated data from the original data, then the inverse for the unknowns inside the local region is done through the above newly produced data. This concept is a direct extension of local tomography, generalized inverse and iterative refinement method. It is used to solve the inverse problem with incomplete input data, similar to local tomography. However this concept of local inverse also can be applied to complete input data. Local inverse for full field of view system or over-determined system : \\\\begin{bmatrix} f \\\\\\\\\\\\ g \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\\\\\\\\\ C & D \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix} Assume there is E, F, G and H that satisfies, : \\\\begin{bmatrix} E & F \\\\\\\\\\\\ G & H \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\\\\\\\\\ C & D \\\\end{bmatrix} = J Here J is not equal to I. J is close to I. I is identical matrix. Examples of this kind of matrix \\\\begin{bmatrix} E & F \\\\\\\\\\\\ G & H \\\\end{bmatrix} are for example, filtered back- projection method for image reconstruction, the inverse with regularization. In this case an approximate solution can be found as following, and : \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_0 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} E & F \\\\\\\\\\\\ G & H \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} f \\\\\\\\\\\\ g \\\\end{bmatrix} A better solution for x_1 can be found as following, : \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} E & F \\\\\\\\\\\\ G & H \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} f - B y_0\\\\\\\\\\\\ g - D y_0 \\\\end{bmatrix} In the above formula y_1 is useless, hence : x_1=E(f-B y_0)+F(g - D y_0) In the same way, there is : y_1=G(f-A x_0)+H(g - C x_0) In the above the solution is only divided to as two parts. x is inside the ROI(region of Interest) y is at outside of ROI. f is inside of FOV(field of view) y is outside of FOV. The two parts can be extended to many parts, in this case, the extended method is referred as the sub-region iterative refinement method method Shuangren Zhao, Xintie Yang, Iterative reconstruction in all sub-regions , SCIENCEPAPER ONLINE. 2006; 1(4): page 301‚Äì308, http://www.paper.edu.cn/uploads/journal/2007/42/1673-7180(2006)04-0301-08.pdf Local inverse for limited-field-of-view system or under-determined system : \\\\begin{bmatrix} f \\\\\\\\\\\\ g \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\\\\\\\\\ C & D \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix} Assume A, B, C, D are known matrices; x and y are unknown vectors; f is known vector; g is unknown vector.

The local inverse algorithm is as follows: (1) g_{ex}. An extrapolated g function is obtained by :g_{ex}_{\\\\partial G}=f_{\\\\partial F} (2) y_0. An approximate y function is calculated by ::y_0=H g_{ex} (3) y'. A correction for y is done by ::y'=y_0+y_\\\\text{co} (4) f'. A corrected function for f is calculated by ::f' = f-B y' (5) g_{1ex}. An extrapolated g function is obtained by ::g_{1ex}_{\\\\partial G}=f'_{\\\\partial F} (6) x_1. A local inverse solution is obtained :: x_1 = E f' +F g_{1ex} In the above algorithm, there are two time extrapolations for g functions which are used to overcome the data truncation problem. There is a correction for y. This correction can be a constant correction to correct the DC values of y function or a linear correction according to the prior knowledges about the y function. This algorithm can be found in reference.Shuangren Zhao, Kang Yang, Dazong Jiang, Xintie Yang, Interior reconstruction using local inverse, J Xray Sci Technol. 2011; 19(1): 69‚Äì90 In the example of reference,S.

In that example the constant correction is made. More complicated correction can be made, for example linear correction, which perhaps achieves better results. = A^+ B is close to 0= Shuang-ren Zhao defined a Local inverse to solve the above problem. First consider the simplest solution. : f = A x + B y or : A x = f - B y = f' Here f'=f - B y is the correct data in which there is no the influence of the object function in outside. From this data it is easy to get correct solution, or : x' = A^{-1} f' Here x' is a correct(or exact) solution of the unknown x, that means x' = x. In case that A is not a square matrix or it has no inverse, generalized inverse can applied, : x' = A^{+} (f - B y)= A^{+} f' Since y is unknown, if it is set to 0, a approximate solution is obtained. : x_0 = A^{+} f On the above solution the result x_0 is related to the unknown vector y. Since y can be any values, this way the result x_0 has very strong artifacts which is :\\\\mathrm{error}_0=x_0-x'=A^{+} B y This kind of artifact is referred as truncation artifacts in the field of CT image reconstruction. In order to minimize the above artifacts of the solution, a special matrix Q is considered, which satisfies : QB = 0 Hence, : QA x = Qf - QB y = Qf solve the above equation with Generalized inverse : x_1 =[QA]^{+} Qf = [A]^{+} Q^{+} Qf Here Q^{+} is generalized inverse of the matrix Q. x_1 is a solution for x. It is easy to find a matrix Q which satisfy QB=0, Q can be written as following: : Q = I-BB^{+} This kind of matrix Q is referred as transverse projection of matrix B Here B^{+} is the generalized inverse of the matrix B. B^{+} satisfies : BB^{+}B=B It can be proven that : QB=[I-BB^{+}]B=B- BB^{+}B=B-B=0 It is easy to prove that QQ=Q : \\\\begin{align} QQ & =[I-BB^+][I-BB^+] = I-2 BB^+ + BB^+ BB^+ \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = I-2 BB^+ + BB^+ = I-BB^+ = Q \\\\end{align} and hence : QQQ=(QQ)Q=QQ=Q Hence Q is also the generalized inverse of Q That means : Q^{+}Q=QQ=Q Hence, : x_1 =A^{+}[Q]^{+} Qf =A^{+} Q f or : x_1 =[A]^{+} [I-BB^{+}] f The matrix : A^L=[A]^{+} [I-BB^{+}] A^L is referred as the local inverse of Matrix \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\\\\\\\\\ C & D \\\\end{bmatrix} . Using local inverse instead of generalized inverse or inverse can avoid the artifacts from unknown input data. Considering, : [A]^{+} [I-BB^{+}]f'=[A]^{+} [I-BB^{+}](f-B y) = [A]^{+} [I-BB^{+}]f Hence there is, : x_1 =[A]^{+} [I-BB^{+}] f' Hence x_1 is only related the correct data f'. This kind error can be calculated as : \\\\mathrm{error}_1 = x_1-x' = [A]^{+}BB^{+} f'  This kind error are called bowl effect. Bowl effect does not related the unknown object y, it is only related the correct data f' In case the contribution of [A]^{+}BB^{+}f' to x are smaller than that of [A]^{+} B y , or :\\\\mathrm{error}_1\\\\ll \\\\mathrm{error}_0 the local inverse solution x_1 is better than x_0 for this kind of inverse problem. Using x_1 instead of x_0, the truncation artifacts are replaced as bowl effect. This result is same as local tomography, hence local inverse is a direct extension of the concept of the local tomography. It is well known that the solution of the generalized inverse is a minimal L2 norm method. From the above derivation it is clear that the solution of local inverse is a minimal L2 norm method subject to the condition that the influence of unknown object y is 0. Hence the local inverse is also a direct extension of the concept of the generalized inverse.

This series of systems has been installed on destroyers of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force built between FY1977 and FY2001 to control medium-caliber guns and Sea Sparrow missiles, including ESSM. Background In the 1960s, the had been developing FCS-1, a traditional manned ship gun fire-control system. Then, in response to the sinking of Eilat in 1967, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force began to focus on improving anti-ship missile defense (ASMD) capabilities. Since FY1970, the TRDI began to develop the , a new ASMD-capable FCS. In FY1975, a prototype was installed in with an OTO Melara 76 mm compact gun, and a marine test was started. In the initial plan, it was to be introduced into service with the built under the FY1975 program, but it was abandoned due to development delay and dutch WM-25 was installed for this class. In order to solve this plan delay, special work groups were formed in 1978 with uniformed officials and civilian engineers. As they conducted vigorous research and fierce shooting experiments of hundreds of shots a day, shooting accuracy improved dramatically and all problems were solved. Design In the prototype, there were two antennas for track while scan operation: slotted waveguide antenna for searching and cassegrain antenna for tracking. Both antennas were covered with a radome. Also outside of the radome, an electro-optical tracker was installed. As a fire-control computer, digital electronic computer was installed instead of an electromechanical analog computer of the FCS-1. Mass production versions were put into service with destroyers and destroyer escorts built under the FY1977 program. On the , a combination of one FCS-2-12 and one FCS-2-21 was adopted at the beginning. FCS-2-12 is very similar to the prototype, but adds a missile guidance function. FCS-2-21A is a simplified version specialized in gun fire-control, adding an electro-optical tracker on the left side of tracking radar antenna and omitting the search radar antenna. And a FCS-2-21B was installed on the destroyer escort , which introduced a Passive electronically scanned array antenna instead of a cassegrain antenna and was capable of searching. Then many minor change models were developed. In the second-generation DDs, two FCS-2-31 are installed, not a combination of two heterogeneous models. In this model, a dish similar to 2-21A controls both a medium-caliber gun and Sea Sparrow missiles.

So far only a geographical reference, Azerbaijan now became the name of a state, and some 2 million people, called variously Tatars, Transcaucasian Muslims and Caucasian Turks, officially became Azerbaijanis.  History  At the beginning of 1918, the political situation in the Caucasus remained critical. After the failure of the Russian-Germany peace talks in Brest-Litovsk, the German-Turkish troops began to attack on 6 December 1917 in the Caucasus. At the beginning of January 1918 Turkish troops were able to capture the Kars and Batumi provinces.

Biography Clodovis Boff is grandson of Italian immigrants who arrived from Veneto region to Rio Grande do Sul in the late nineteenth century. He did his primary and secondary studies in Concordia, Rio Negro and Agudos. Boff studied philosophy in Mogi das Cruzes and obtained a doctorate in theology at the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium. As early as 1986 Clodovis Boff declared that the acquisition of Marxist categories have performed in the early stages of liberation theology an attitude of carelessness and exaggeration.[Clodovis Boff: Die Befreiung der Armen. 1986, S. 26.] Currently, Clodovis Boff and his brother Leonardo Boff are confronted ideologically due to his brother's position in relation to ecclesiastical institutions. Leonardo still considering that option for the poor is \\"a truly evangelical option to have a life bathed to submerge in the faith of Christ, both in its origin, it comes from the encounter with the Son of God, who was rich became poor, but also in his exercise, as vibrates to the sentiments of the Good Shepherd's heart\\".[\\"O Documento de Aparecida √© o ponto mais alto do Magist√©rio da Igreja latino- americana e caribenha\\", IHU Online] He is a Catholic theologian of the Order of the Servite Order, initially an adherent of Liberation Theology, and now in full agreement with the Latin American bishops who gathered in Aparecida in 2007. Boff lives in Curitiba and is a professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Paran√°. Unlike his brother Leonardo Boff, he was not processed by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, although in the 1980s he lost his chair at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, in addition to being restricted from the theological faculty of his Order in Rome.

Built in 1889 and lasting only two seasons, the fair‚Äôs main structure was destroyed in a massive fire the following year and never rebuilt.  Building  = Development = The brainchild of Robert A. Cameron, an employee of the Fort Worth & Denver Railway, the Texas Spring Palace was a large-scale structure and fairground, which like various ‚Äúcrop palaces‚Äù and ice palaces across North America was inspired by London‚Äôs Crystal Palace and Paris' Exposition Universelle. Built at the same time as the Eiffel Tower, the Texas Spring Palace was typical of a period of monumental structures, grand expositions, and spectacle. = Construction = A number of local railroad companies co-sponsored the Texas Spring Palace in order to boost tourism, investment, and immigration to Texas. The three-block-wide showcase building was designed by Arthur Albert Messer (1863-1934) of Fort Worth architecture firm Armstrong & Messer and featured eight towers and a massive dome. The exterior shell of the all-wood structure was built by the City of Fort Worth near the current location of the main Fort Worth post office on Lancaster Avenue, just south of downtown. The structure was built at a cost of $35,000 in just 31 days. The building‚Äôs center dome was the second largest in the nation, behind only the dome of the U.S. capitol building; the interior featured an exhibit hall, log cabin, tipi, prairie dog town, a man- made cave, and a fountain stocked with fish and waterfowl. Exhibits, such as working silkworms and Sam Houston's cane, were provided by ‚Äúevery willing Texas town, organization, and company,‚Äù and interiors decorated by women‚Äôs clubs. The building‚Äôs exterior was liberally decorated with crop art made from a wide variety of Texas agricultural products, including wheat, corn, millet, cotton, grasses, mosses, cacti, coal, animal hides, seashells, cattle horns and skulls, and even a taxidermy steer. Grains of Texas corn and oats were embedded in the tar roof instead of the usual gravel. The building was expanded to double its original size for the 1890 season. = Fire = A flash fire of unknown origin erupted on the night of May 30, 1890 with over 5,000 visitors in the building attending one of the nightly balls held at the Texas Spring Palace. The wooden structure, covered in dried agricultural products that had already weathered more than a year of extreme Texas weather, was leveled in less than 15 minutes and no part of the building could be saved. The fire and destruction of the Texas Spring Palace was front-page news nationwide. Remarkably, only one life was lost in the blaze. Al Hayne, a 40-year-old Fort Worth civil engineer originally from London, England died of injuries he sustained while saving women and children from the massive fire. A monument was erected in honor of Hayne in 1893. Ada Large, a local fifteen- year-old, was also awarded a medal by the City of Fort Worth for her role in helping others out of the burning structure.  Legacy  Though it only lasted for two seasons, the Texas Spring Palace was ultimately a success for Fort Worth and the state of Texas: the event received national exposure in major cities, it brought businesses and investment to Fort Worth, and thousands of visitors learned about everything Texas had to offer. Visitors came from every state, plus England, Scotland, Iceland, Belgium, Canada, and Mexico. Nearly a third of all visitors came from outside of Texas. Another outcome of the Texas Spring Palace disaster was the formation of a professional fire department in 1893; Fort Worth only had a volunteer fire department until the Texas Spring Palace fire made obvious the need for full- time firefighting. Although Fort Worth leaders fully intended to rebuild the Texas Spring Palace, plans were eventually scrapped after a decade of struggling to get the project off the ground. The Fort Worth Stock Show and the State Fair of Texas ultimately grew to include many of the popular components of the Texas Spring Palace. Today, there are only a few reminders of the Texas Spring Palace in Fort Worth. A painting of the building by a San Antonio artist is on view in the Tarrant County Courthouse, and Al Hayne's tombstone can be seen at Oakwood Cemetery just north of downtown Fort Worth. The most well-known relic of the Texas Spring Palace is the Al Hayne Monument, which is part of the city's public art collection. Dedicated in 1893 by the Fort Worth Park League, the memorial was originally designed by local architecture firm Messer, Sanguinet and Messer to be used as a fountain for watering horses. The construction of a new train station and related improvements required the monument to be moved and rebuilt in 1934. It now features a bronze bust of Hayne by Fort Worth artist Evaline Sellors atop a base of stone quarried in nearby Granbury, Texas. The monument is now located in a small park called the Haynes Memorial Triangle at the intersection of Lancaster Avenue and Main Street at the south end of downtown Fort Worth, close to the former site of the Texas Spring Palace.

It is the vector of aster yellows disease, which affects various vegetable plants, weeds and ornamental plants. Description The aster leafhopper is a small species, with males reaching about in length and females about . The fore-wings are greyish-green while the abdomen is yellowish-green. Six pairs of minute black spots or streaks on the head give the insect its alternative name of six-spotted leafhopper. Ecology In the United States, strong southerly winds in the spring carry adults northwards to the Mid West and northern parts of the country, and these insects usually arrive earlier and exceed in number the resident insects that have been overwintering there, mostly on grasses and cereals. Eggs are laid on a wide range of host plants which include grasses and clovers, corn, oats, rye, carrots and various weeds. The eggs hatch in about one week and the whole life cycle takes about four weeks. Carrot, dill, potato and radish are selected by adults for feeding purposes but are not good for breeding purposes. The leafhopper is attacked by several parasitoids including Pachygonatopus minimus, Neogonatopus ombrodes and Epigonatopus plesius. Aster yellows Aster yellows is a disease of various vegetable crops, weeds and ornamental plants and is transmitted almost entirely by the aster leafhopper. The disease is caused by phytoplasmas, specialised bacteria that are obligate parasites of plant tissue. The symptoms shown by the plant are a yellowing of the leaf veins followed by yellowing of the leaf blades, spindly stems with pale leaves, stunting of the plant, and deformed flowers, which sometimes show green colouring. Vegetable crops affected include carrot, celery, lettuce, potato, cucumber, pumpkin and squash.

Only one structure built since then within Canada has surpassed its height: the CN Tower in Toronto. The original mast collapsed in an ice storm in 1983 and was subsequently rebuilt in 1985. The CKX-TV Craig broadcasting tower is currently fifth in height among the tallest structures in the Commonwealth of Nations.

The series takes place in the near-future and focuses on various virtual reality MMORPG worlds. Originally self-published online under the pseudonym Fumio Kunori,Afterword of the first light novel volume. ASCII Media Works began publishing the novels on April 10, 2009 under their Dengeki Bunko imprint. The series has since grown to 24 volumes as of May 9, 2020. Yen Press began publishing the novels in English in North America and the United Kingdom with the first volume on April 22, 2014. The novels are also published in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, France, Poland and Russia. With more than 16 million copies in print worldwide, there are future plans for publications in Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Vietnam and others. Kawahara also began writing a parallel series of light novels titled Sword Art Online: Progressive, a retelling and soft reboot of the original series' Aincrad arc. However, instead of covering the arc in one light novel, Kawahara plans to take a floor by floor approach in the Progressive version of the Aincrad arc. The first volume was released on October 10, 2012. As of May 10, 2018, six volumes have been published as part of the Progressive series. In addition to the original storyline of Sword Art Online and Sword Art Online: Progressive, Kawahara has also written and published Sword Art Online side stories. These side stories have been posted on his website, in a collection of side stories in Accel World, have been sold at Comitia, Dengeki Bunko's Fair and have come along with the limited edition Blu-Ray/DVD Sword Art Online compilation volumes. Before Sword Art Online was published, Kawahara had posted Sword Art Online novels on his website and there are still a few side stories on Sword Art Online, although the original novels have been removed. In addition, Kawahara has published a side story of Sword Art Online in one of his other works, Accel World. In the tenth volume of Accel World, there is a chapter where it depicts a cross over between Sword Art Online and Accel World. Several of the side stories that he has released are in a collection called the Sword Art Online Material Edition, sold at the Comitia d≈çjinshi-selling event, which range from novels to manga. However, all of the art in the Material Editions is drawn by Kawahara himself. Aside from the light novels written by Kawahara, there are also two spin-offs written by other authors with supervision by him. The first one is Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online series written by Keiichi Sigsawa and illustrated by Kouhaku Kuroboshi, while the other is Sword Art Online Alternative: Clover's Regret, written by Watase Souichirou and illustrated by Ginta. While both of these series take place in the same world as the main series written by Kawahara, they each feature different characters as the focus compared to the main series.

Wards in dark grey were not contested in 2008. The 2008 Colchester Borough Council election took place on 1 May 2008 to elect members of Colchester Borough Council in Essex, England. One third of the council was up for election and the Conservative party lost overall control of the council to no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 27 *Liberal Democrats 23 *Labour 7 *Independent 3 Background After the last election in 2007 the Conservatives held half of the seats on the council with 30 councillors, while the Liberal Democrats had 21 seats, Labour 6 seats and there were 3 independents. However, in July 2007, 2 Liberal Democrat councilors, Craig and Terry Sutton, defected to the Conservatives after falling out with the local Liberal Democrat Member of parliament Bob Russell over a new community stadium. This gave the Conservatives a majority on the council with 32 of the 60 seats. 20 seats were contested at the election, with the Conservatives defending 12 of the seats. A total of 82 candidates stood at the election, including full slates from the Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Labour and Green parties, along with one candidate from the British National Party. Election result The Conservatives lost their majority on the council after losing 5 seats, 4 to the Liberal Democrats and 1 to Labour. Among those who lost seats were 2 members of the Conservative council cabinet, while Craig Sutton in Berechurch lost his seat to Labour after having defected to the Conservatives from the Liberal Democrats in 2007. Conservative defeats were attributed to high levels of housebuilding in the area, with the Conservatives dropping to 27 seats, while the Liberal Democrats rose to 23 seats and Labour went up to 7 seats. Meanwhile, the British National Party came fourth in High Woods ward with 131 votes after putting up the party's first candidate for Colchester council. Overall turnout at the election was 34.5%. Following the election the Liberal Democrat, Labour and independent groups made a deal to take control over the council from the Conservatives, with Liberal Democrat Anne Turrell becoming the new leader of the council.

It was released on June 18, 2014, in France, on July 16 in Sweden, and on October 17 in North America. The film is directed by Linkin Park turntablist Joe Hahn, with Vincent D'Onofrio serving as executive producer. D'Onofrio has also worked as an actor in the film as Danny. Peter Stormare, Gina Gershon, Mimi Rogers, Brian Rodriguez and Cameron Monaghan also star in the film. The film was produced by Hahn, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Sam Maydew. The film is Hahn's full- length directorial debut and his second directed film after The Seed, which was a 10-minute short. The story for the film features lives of five disaffected suburbanites come together at a shopping mall.\\"Mall\\"Spin.com Retrieved June 28, 2014 Plot Mal, an addict, shoots his mother, sets their trailer on fire, and heads to the mall. At the same time, a cop urges philosophical college student Jeff to stop loitering on private property. Jeff and his friend Adelle also go to the mall, as Jeff tells her about his belief that modern society has become soulless and a shallow facsimile of itself. Jeff describes several of the people that they see at the mall and narratives what he imagines their back story to be: Donna, a bored housewife who obsesses over her attractiveness; Barry, a salesman who hates his business but stays in it because he understands it; Michael, a security guard who, after immigrating, becomes a widower and lives only for his job; and Danny, a married businessman who engages in casual sex. Jeff and Adelle meet up with Beckett and Shel, and Beckett shares ecstasy with Jeff. Beckett attempts to talk Jeff out of his crush on Adelle, to no avail. When Danny is arrested (by the same cop who hassled Jeff) for peeping on Donna who forgets to lock the fitting room door while she changes clothes, Beckett and Shel leave to gawk at the scene. Alone with Adelle, Jeff confesses to her that he has fallen in love with her, but she calls him unexciting and wanders off. Mal arrives at the mall and kills Barry, who is his father, and several cops. Hurt, Jeff stumbles in a drug-addled daze through the mall, not aware of the crowds that have begun to flee. Mal leaves the mall, kills the cops who arrested Danny, and heads to the forest. Michael grabs a spare rifle from Mal's car and follows him. Beckett, Shel, and Adelle arrive in the parking lot, where they find Danny still handcuffed. As they discuss what to do with him, he begs them to free him so that he can go home. After Beckett and Shel leave to vandalize the mall, Adelle points out that she can do anything she wants to Danny. She moves him to his own car, binds him in place with a seat belt, tightens his handcuffs, and molests him while forcing him to repeat, \\"I'm a pervert.\\" She leaves once he passes out. Meanwhile, Jeff meets Donna in a bar, and after he tells her that she does not look old enough to have kids, she invites him to a motel room, where they have sex. Unconcerned with what has happened at the mall, Donna merely asks for details so that she can craft a believable cover story. Jeff wanders back to the mall, where he discovers Beckett and Shell taking pictures of Danny with their cell phones. Jeff chases them away and offers to take Danny to a hospital. Danny requests that he brought back to his home. When Danny asks Jeff if he knows Adelle based on her description, Jeff says that she is not a friend. Satisfied, Danny approaches his house, still handcuffed. As Jeff walks off, he encounters Mal, who ended up wounded after a shootout with Michael. Mal and Jeff talk briefly, and Mal requests that Jeff kill him. Jeff refuses and calls him a coward who is willing to die but not to live. As Jeff runs off, the cops gather for an assault on Mal's location. As Donna returns to her boring life, Jeff quotes Steppenwolf, saying that one day he will learn to laugh. The film ends as he laughs. Cast The casting for the film was done by Angela Demo and Barbara J.

It was the first self-serve supermarket in the country and one of the greatest achievements of modernism in Poland. Supersam was demolished in 2006 and replaced by a new architectural complex built between 2013 and 2015. History The Warsaw supermarket was built in 1962 at the Lublin Union Square (formerly also Mokotowski square,) on the site of the former Polish Radio building. Historically (1770-1818), this place was called Rondo Mokotowskie and standing here was the Southern Gate to the city. The supermarket building was an innovative design with a roof on the principle of tensegrity suspended and kept in place by steel girders and cables, designed by three architects: Professor Jerzy Hryniewiecki, Maciej Krasinski, Maciej Gintowt and three engineers: Waclaw Zalewski, a Professor Emeritus of MIT, Professor Stanislaw Kusia and Andrzej ≈ª√≥rawski. Although a campaign was carried out to save the building from destruction as an architectural monument valuable PRL and unique construction design for its time, Supersam was demolished in December 2006.  Architecture and technology  A hanging roof was desired from the beginning, but this would require sloping roof mainstays that would take up valuable real estate and would make the building structure vulnerable to catastrophic failure due to accidents or vandalism. Through progressive designs, a method was developed, by structural engineer Wac≈Çaw Zalewski, employing the principle of tensegrity, to eliminate the backstays by alternating cables and arches of similar curvature. The outward thrust of arches at their highest points exactly balances the inward pull of the cables at each end. This whole structure was supported vertically by columns. As the building aged, and further demands were placed on the roof structure, the building had to eventually be demolished reportedly because it was unsafe, according to the building owner, but this is a disputed fact. Lublin Union Square In 2009, a new Supersam was opened in a new location in Katowice the corner of Domaniewska and Pu≈Çawska, led by the Cooperative Warszawska Sp√≥≈Çdzielnia Spo≈ºywc√≥w Supersam who served the previous building. This hall is to be temporary until the hill by the developer 90-meter triangular office building surrounded by a mall on the site of the former Supersam. In the years 2010-2013 in the place where the former Supersam existed, a new office building and commercial space at Lublin Union Square called the \\"Plac Unii\\". 12 October 2013 a new \\"Supersam\\" was built. The buildings will house a 15,000 square meter shopping mall and 41,000 m2 of class A+ office space. The total area of the building, including the underground levels, will exceed 100,000 square meters. The complex foundation will feature four underground floors. The three lowest floors will serve as a parking lot for 800 cars. Whereas, the floor just below ground level will host a delicatessen operated by merchants of the Supersam Grocers Cooperative, after years, making their come-back to the Lublin Union Square.

Rose, is an American Christian electronic dance music singer. Formerly signed to Clear Sight Music, she released two studio albums under that label, V. Rose in 2011 and Forever After in 2014, the latter of which charted at No. 28 on the Billboard Top Christian chart, and No. 16 on the Heatseekers. V. Rose was re-released with a bonus disc in 2013 and titled The Electro-Pop Deluxe. She currently is signed to Inpop Records, where they released, Young Dangerous Heart, on April 22, 2016.  Biography  V. Rose was born Vienna Rose Da Re on January 9, 1989 in Sacramento, California. At age six, V. Rose started singing, but by age eight asked God to help her compose music. In her teenage years, V. Rose and a childhood friend started a group called Harmony. When V. Rose was 15, producer SPEC signed the group to Spechouse Media, but Harmony soon folded in 2005. After the disbandment of Harmony, V. Rose signed to Spechouse as a solo artist, and she eventually appeared on two songs by FLAME on his album Captured. She was subsequently signed to FLAME's Clear Sight label, releasing her self-titled debut album on August 16, 2011; however, the album did not garner any commercial charting successes. It was well received by music critics, with CCM Magazine calling the album an \\"upbeat pop production set to spiritually-grounded lyrics.\\" On the other hand, V. Rose's sophomore studio album with Clear Sight Music, entitled Forever After and released on May 20, 2014, met with greater commercial success, charting on both the Christian Albums and Heatseekers Albums charts at Nos. 28 and 16 respectively, for the charting week of June 7, 2014. On February 18, 2015, the website Rapzilla reported that V. Rose has signed to the Nashville-based Inpop Records.  Musical style  V. Rose's musical style has been labeled as a mixture of pop, hip hop, R&B;, rock, and electronic dance music. Jesus Freak Hideout in a review of V. Rose stated that the pop, R&B;, and rock sound on the album's opening track is used much throughout the entire release, and said that V. Rose \\"should soon find herself among the elite in that great radio- play-type of girl-power-pop sound.\\" New Release Tuesday considered V. Rose to range from \\"rock to pop to R&B; to rap to straight-up, old-school Gospel.\\" Rich Smith of Louder Than the Music reviewed a re-release of V. Rose, entitled The Electro-Pop Deluxe, that featured six extra tracks. In keeping with the title, the extra tracks feature an electro pop sound, and three of these were in the EDM vein. Smith found the original part of V.Rose heavily pop-oriented, slightly teen pop in places, but with some dance and more soulful elements.

During the 1950s and 1960s he was associated with the Beat Generation at San Francisco's North Beach.  Life and education  Kenn Davis was born as Kenneth Allan Schmoker in Salinas, California.http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/kenneth_alan_schmoker_born_1932_1562357 After his parents divorced, he moved at age 5 with his mother and younger brother (born Marvin Schmoker) to San Francisco. He attended grammar school in San Francisco. He went to finger painting and drawing classes on Saturdays at the San Francisco Museum of Art,https://kenndavis.wordpress.com/2010/05/30/thumbing-his-nose/ today's San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. At the beginning of WWII, age 10, Kenn and his brother attended a Catholic boy's boarding school in Marin County across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. At the end of the war, Kenn and his brother Marvin moved back to their mother and step father, Henry Davis, who bought Kenn his first easel. Kenn changed his surname to his step father's name. (His brother changed his name to Zekial Marko and became a mystery author under the name of John Trinian.) Kenn attended City College of San Francisco before being drafted into the Korean War in 1952. He left the military in 1954 and returned to study art at the City College of San Francisco. In 1956 he transferred to the San Francisco Art Institute. In 1964, he was hired by the San Francisco Chronicle as photo retoucher and illustrator, a position from which he resigned in 1984.  Friendship with Richard Brautigan  Davis and Marko were close friends of author Richard Brautigan, whom Kenn met in 1956 or 1957. Kenn designed the covers for two of Brautigan's poetry collections, The Galilee Hitch-Hiker (1958) and Lay the Marble Tea (1959). He also frequently sketched him together with others of the North Beach Beat scene. In 1959, Kenn Davis painted a portrait of Richard Brautigan in oil on linen, which also appeared on the cover on a collection of essays on Brautigan edited by John Barber. This book also contains many sketches by Kenn Davis.  Works  = Paintings = Davis was mostly a surrealist. Some of his paintings reflect a critical analysis of society while others show an introspection of human psychology. Some paintings still draw on material reality and thus could be classified under magic realism. The style of his surrealistic paintings show the influence of European surrealists like Hieronymus Bosch. His earlier paintings of the 1950s and 1960s are darker both in color schemes and mood than his later paintings. The technique of his oil paintings at the end of the 1950s and early 1960s show the influence of old masters. His later paintings often include a humorous or satirical detail. Kenn Davis first solo exhibition was at the Studio 44 Gallery in San Francisco in 1956. Davis' paintings were displayed at the Coffee Gallery in San Francisco. Davis designed the book covers of Robert Bloch's Lost in Time and Space with Lefty Feep, edited by John Stanley, 1987, Creatures at Large Press, as well as Creature Features Strikes Again Movie Guide and Revenge of the Creature Features Movie Guide, both by John Stanley.

D. The site has been designated as an area monument (Denkmalzone)Bad D√ºrkheim: Information board at the Quarry (Infotafel am Steinbruch). and is owned by the Drachenfels Club.  Location  The Kriemhildenstuhl lies left of the small river of the Isenach northwest of Bad D√ºrkheim at a height of 250 metres above sea level on the southeastern hillside of the 300-metre-high K√§stenberg. The latter is a southern spur of the Teufelsstein, which belongs to the Haardt mountains which form the eastern perimeter of the Palatine Forest range, facing the Upper Rhine Plain. Immediately above the quarry is the Heidenmauer, a 26 hectare fortified Celtic settlement from the late Hallstatt era. The Brunhildisstuhl a little below the Kriemhildenstuhl was probably another a Roman quarry. Other old Roman quarries in the vicinity are found in the Kallstadter T√§lchen valley and on the Weilerskopf.  Excavation history  = Early excavations = In the Middle Ages the quarry was erroneously linked to the Burgundians and the Nibelungenlied. Archaeological excavations were carried out in 1884, 1893/94, 1916/17, 1934/35 and 1937‚Äì1939. In the Nazi era, unsuccessful attempts were made to prove, as a result of excavationsExcavations by Hans Schleif, 1937‚Äì1939, see also Heidenmauer. that the quarry was an Old Germanic cult site. = Recent excavations = As a result of excavations in the second half of the 20th century, new information surfaced about the technology and worker organisation of the Romans and brought new inscriptions to light.  Technology and work organisation  Information board at the quarry with diagrams and drawings Field badge of the 22nd Legion Inscription of 3 legionnaires In the semi-circular quarry, whitish quartzitic sandstone of the Karlstal beds of the Middle Bunter was extracted. Because quarrying was carried out near the plateau, the rock was presumably only covered by a thin layer of earth. Quarrying was undertaken using several working parties, so- called Arbeitsk√∂pfe. Individual Arbeitsk√∂pfe were 25 metres above the next level below. From hammer marks on the rock, it is evident that the blocks of stone were between 1.20 and 3 metres long, between 0.6 and 1.4 metres wide and up to 0.6 metres high. Occasionally, capitals and round stones, perhaps for columns, made.

The film was released on November 20, 2015, by RLJ Entertainment and Image Entertainment. Plot Four young men invest borrowed money in a company guaranteed to return their venture capital tenfold or more. It does not seem to trouble them that the privileged information on which they are acting was derived from insider trading. Two little things go wrong. The company suddenly folds under the pressure of federal scrutiny and their financial benefactor turns out to be a high-powered mobster. The mobster, named Eddie (John Travolta), offers them a way out of their awkward situation. They are to kidnap and hold a man for 24 hours before turning him over to Eddie and his two-man wrecking crew. This action will clear their massive debt with him, and everyone will cheerfully go their separate ways. But a couple more annoying little inconveniences crop up. One of them is that the kidnap victim is related to an underworld kingpin who offers a two million dollar reward to the first one to recover his nephew. Another is that the four kidnappers are now required to collectively murder their victim before being allowed to leave the building alive. Adding to these contingencies is the fact that things are not at all what they seem. Perceived motivations may turn out to be vastly different from actual motivations. What at first seemed patently predictable is anything but.

Sarawak Independence Day (also known as Hari Kemerdekaan Sarawak, Hari Sarawak or Sarawak Day) is a holiday observed on 22 July every year by the state of Sarawak in Malaysia, celebrating the establishment of self-government and de facto independence on 22 July 1963. The official Sarawak Independence Day public holiday was gazetted by the government of Sarawak in 2016 to raise awareness about Sarawak's past and contributions of its past leaders. Despite this official name, there are those who still avoided using this title, due to lack of awareness of its legality (it is, in fact, officially gazetted), while some still argue about its historical accuracy, citing British legislation did not provide for an official, full independence. Nonetheless, there was indeed a degree of de facto independence in the form of self-government ahead of it taking part in the foundingDespite commonly phrased, the notion that Sarawak \\"joined Malaysia\\" on 16 Sept 1963 is factually incorrect, as the Federation of Malaysia was not an existing entity until its four founding nations (North Borneo, Singapore, Sarawak and the Federation of Malaya) brought it into being. of a new federation in the form of Malaysia with other partners. The idea of a Sarawakian holiday was mooted by the Sarawak state government and citizens since 2012, after public discontent about the public holiday Hari Merdeka being too Malaya-centric. The day was officially named Sarawak Independence Day and declared as a public holiday for the first time in 2016.  Background  Crown colony. The Sultanate of Brunei granted the Raj of Sarawak to rule of the Brooke Dynasty in 1841, Sarawak was subsequently recognised as a sovereign nation by the United States (1850) and Great Britain (1864), and it voluntarily became a British protectorate (military protection) in 1888. After the end of World War II, the territory was briefly administered by the British Military Administration, then became a Crown Colony in 1946 when it was ceded to British Government by Charles Vyner Brooke. The transferring of the territory to colonial administration had led to major protests by Sarawakian citizens who wanted the independence of Sarawak to be restored. This led to the assassination of Duncan Stewart, the second governor of the Colony, by Rosli Dhobi, who was captured and subsequently hanged for murder. The position of the Governor was succeeded by Anthony Abell, who also became one of the members for the Cobbold Commission which brought Sarawak and North Borneo to the formation of the Federation of Malaysia. Sarawak was granted independent self-rule on 22 July 1963, on the expectation that it would jointly form the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September the same year. It is said that before the ceremony on 22 July 1963, Alexander Waddell, the last Governor of the Colony, left the Astana and boarded a white sampan to cross the Sarawak River, then handed the administration of Sarawak to the Sarawakian citizens, with the colonial Union Jack flag lowered for the last time, and the Sarawak flag raised. Some historians dispute the significance of that event and whether it was tantamount to a granting of full independence. However, on the same day, the outgoing Governor did indeed proclaim the appointment of Stephen Kalong Ningkan as the first Chief Minister of Sarawak as well as the appointment of new Supreme Council members who formed the government's first ministerial Cabinet of Sarawak. In 2016, the Sarawak Government under Chief Minister Adenan Satem officially gazetted 22 July as a Sarawak public holiday and that it henceforth be known as \\"Sarawak Independence Day\\".

History The club was founded on 19 July 1919 as Brasil Football Club. In 1936 the club was renamed to Recreativo Brasil Esporte Clube, and in 1944, owing to a law prohibiting national denominations in club names, to Palmeiras Esporte Clube. On 19 July 1980 the club was renamed to Blumenau Esporte Clube in order to widen its appeal in the community. The colour red was integrated into the club's insignia in consideration of the club Gr√™mio Esportivo Ol√≠mpico - founded in 1920 and winner of the state championship of Santa Catarina, the Campeonato Catarinense, of 1949 and 1964 - which ceased its football operations in 1971. The club was between 1927 and 1988 six times runner-up in the state championships. In 1989 Blumenau, frequently referred to as \\"BEC\\", participated in the Copa do Brasil, where it was eliminated in the second round. In 1989 and 1991 the club participated in the national second division, the S√©rie B and in 1988, 1992, 1994, 1997 and 1998 in the third division, S√©rie C. Relegation in the state championship 1998 aggravated financial problems and led after an initial withdrawal from competition to bankruptcy. After a resurrection in 2003 the club took part in a lower level of the state championship and got close to promotion. Renewed financial issues forced the club again to withdraw after this. Since the club has been reincarnated as Blumenau Entretenimentos Comunit√°rios and Blumenau Sport Club Madureira, participating in the third state division in 2008 and 2013 respectively, where it achieved the second place and promotion. As per 2014 the club plays again as Blumenau Esporte Clube and finished the second tier S√©rie B of the state league of Santa Catarina in sixth position. In the following year Blumenau finished tenth and last, leading to relegation to S√©rie C. Other local clubs in Blumenau are Associa√ß√£o Blumenauense de Futebol, founded in 1999 and at some stages in the third state division, and the Clube Atl√©tico Metropolitano, founded in 2002, which since has established itself in the first state division and participates since 2010 nationally in the S√©rie D.

In the case of molecular systems, this tensor measures the fluctuation of the electrons around their mean positions, which corresponds to the delocalization of the electronic charge within a molecular system. The total position-spread can discriminate between metals and insulators taking information from the ground state wave function. This quantity can be very useful as an indicator to characterize Intervalence charge transfer processes, the bond nature of molecules (covalent, ionic, or weakly bonded), and Metal‚Äìinsulator transition. Overview The Localization Tensor (LT) is a per electron quantity proposed in the context of the theory of Kohn to characterize electrical conductivity properties. In 1964, Kohn realized that electrical conductivity is more related to the proper delocalization of the wave function than a simple bandgap. In fact, he proposed that a qualitative difference between insulators and conductors also manifests as a different organization of the electrons in their ground state where one has that: the wave function is strongly localized in insulators and very delocalized in conductors. The interesting outcome of this theory is: i) it relates the classical idea of localized electrons as a cause of insulating state; ii) the needed information can be recovered from the ground state wave function because in the insulated regime the wave function breaks down as a sum of disconnected terms. It is until 1999 that Resta and coworkers found a way to define the Kohn delocalization by proposing the already mentioned Localization Tensor. The LT is defined as a second order moment cumulant of the position operator divided by the number of electrons in the system. The key property of the LT is that: it diverges for metals while it takes finite values for insulators in the Thermodynamic limit. Recently, the global quantity (the LT not divided by the number of electrons) has been introduced to study molecules and named Total Position-Spread tensor.  Theory  = Spin-summed total position-spread (SS-TPS) = The total position spread Œõ is defined as the second moment cumulant of the total electron position operator, and its units are in length square (e.g. bohr¬≤). In order to compute this quantity, one has to take into account the position operator and its tensorial square. For a system of n electrons, the position operator and its Cartesian components are defined as: : \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{r}} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\hat{r}_i (total position) : \\\\hat{x} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\hat{x}_i \\\\qquad \\\\hat{y} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\hat{y}_i \\\\qquad \\\\hat{z} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\hat{z}_i \\\\qquad Where the i index runs over the number of electrons. Each component of the position operator is a one-electron operator, they can be represented in second quantization as follows: : \\\\hat{x}= \\\\sum_{ij} \\\\left \\\\langle i\\\\mid \\\\hat{x}\\\\mid j\\\\right \\\\rangle a^{\\\\dagger}_i a_j where i,j run over orbitals. The expectation values of the position components are the first moments of the electrons' position. Now we consider the tensorial square (second moment). In this sense, there are two types of them: * in quantum chemistry programs like MOLPRO or DALTON the second moment operator is a tensor defined as the sum of the tensor squares of the positions of a single electron. Then, this is a one-electron operator s defined by its Cartesian components: :: \\\\hat{s}_{xx}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\hat{x}_i^2 \\\\qquad \\\\hat{s}_{xy}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\hat{x} \\\\hat{y}\\\\qquad \\\\hat{s}_{xz}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\hat{x} \\\\hat{z} :: \\\\hat{s}_{yy}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\hat{y}_i^2 \\\\qquad \\\\hat{s}_{yz}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\hat{y} \\\\hat{z}\\\\qquad \\\\hat{s}_{zz}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\hat{z}_i^2 : where index i runs over the number of electrons. * there is also the square of the total position operator \\\\hat{r}. This is a two-electron operator S, and also defined by its Cartesian components: :: \\\\hat{S}_{xx}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\hat{x}_i \\\\hat{x}_j \\\\qquad \\\\hat{S}_{xy}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\hat{x}_i \\\\hat{y}_j \\\\qquad \\\\hat{S}_{xz}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^n\\\\hat{x}_i \\\\hat{z}_j :: \\\\hat{S}_{yy}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\hat{y}_i\\\\hat{y}_j \\\\qquad \\\\hat{S}_{yz}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\hat{y}_i \\\\hat{z}_j\\\\qquad \\\\hat{S}_{zz}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\hat{z}_i \\\\hat{z}_j : where indices i,j run over electrons. The second moment of the position becomes then the sum of the one- and two-electron operators already defined: : \\\\mathbf{S}_{ab} = \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{S}}_{ab} + \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{s}}_{ab} Given a n-electron wave function \\\\Psi, one wants to compute the second moment cumulant of it. A cumulant is a linear combination of moments so we have: : \\\\Lambda = \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\Psi\\\\mid S_{ab}\\\\mid\\\\Psi\\\\right \\\\rangle_c = \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\Psi\\\\mid S_{ab}\\\\mid\\\\Psi\\\\right \\\\rangle - \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\Psi\\\\mid\\\\hat{a}\\\\mid\\\\Psi\\\\right \\\\rangle \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\Psi\\\\mid\\\\hat{b}\\\\mid\\\\Psi\\\\right \\\\rangle = Spin-partitioned total position- spread (SP-TPS) = The position operator can be partitioned according to spin components. : \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat r} = \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma = \\\\alpha,\\\\beta} \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat r_{\\\\sigma}} From the one-particle operator it is possible to define the total spin-partitioned position operator as: :\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat R} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma=\\\\alpha,\\\\beta} \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat R}(i) \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n}_\\\\sigma(i) Therefore, the total position operator \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat R} can be expressed by the sum of the two spin parts \\\\alpha and \\\\beta: :\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat R} = \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat R_{\\\\alpha}} + \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat R_{\\\\beta}} and the square of the total position operator decomposes as: :\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat R}^2 = \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat R}_{\\\\alpha}^2 + \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat R}_{\\\\beta}^2 + \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat R}_{\\\\alpha} \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat R}_{\\\\beta} + \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat R}_{\\\\beta} \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat R}_{\\\\alpha} Thus, there are four joint second moment cumulant of the spin-partitioned position operator: :\\\\mathbf{\\\\Lambda} = \\\\mathbf{\\\\Lambda}_{\\\\alpha\\\\alpha} + \\\\mathbf{\\\\Lambda}_{\\\\beta\\\\beta} \\\\+ \\\\mathbf{ \\\\Lambda}_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} + \\\\mathbf{\\\\Lambda}_{\\\\beta\\\\alpha} Applications =Model Hamiltonians= Hubbard model Figure 1: Spin-summed total position-spread as a function of the -t/U ratio is computed numerically for equally-spaced 1D chains of hydrogen atoms. The Hubbard model is a very simple and approximate model employed in Condensed matter physics to describe the transition of materials from metals to insulators. It takes into account only two parameters: i) the kinetic energy or hopping integral denoted by -t; and ii) the on-site repulsion between electrons represented by U (see the example of 1D chain of hydrogen atoms). In Figure 1, there are two limit cases to consider: larger values of -t/U representing a strong charge fluctuation (electrons free to move) whereas for small values of -t/U the electrons are completely localized. The spin-summed total position-spread is very sensitive to these changes because it increases faster than linearly when electrons start to present mobility (0.0 to 0.5 range of -t/U). Heisenberg model = Monitor the wave function = Figure 3: Spin-summed total position-spread as a function of the internuclear distance R for the hydrogen dimer. The total position-spread is a powerful tool to monitor the wave function. In Figure 3 is shown the longitudinal spin-summed total position-spread (Œõ‚à•) computed at full configuration interaction level for the H2 diatomic molecule. The Œõ‚à• in the high repulsive region shows a value that is lower than in the asymptotic limit. This is a consequence of nuclei being near to each other's causing and enhancement of the effective nuclear charge that makes electrons to be more localized. When stretching the bond, the total position-spread starts growing until it reaches a maximum (strong delocalization of the wave function) before the bond is broken. Once the bond is broken, the wave function becomes a sum of disconnected localized regions, and the tensor decreases until it reaches twice the value of the atomic limit (1 bohr¬≤ for each hydrogen atom). = Spin delocalization = Figure 4: Spin-partitioned total position-spread as a function of the internuclear distance R for the hydrogen dimer. When the total position-spread tensor is partitioned according to spin (spin-partitioned total position-spread), it becomes a powerful tool to describe spin delocalization in the insulating regime. In Figure 4 is shown the longitudinal spin-partitioned total position-spread (Œõ‚à•) computed at full configuration interaction level for the H2 diatomic molecule. The horizontal line at 0 bohr2 divides the same spin (positive values) and different spin (negative values) contributions of the spin partitioned total position-spread. Unlike the spin- summed total position-spread that saturates to the atomic value for R>5, the spin-partitioned total position-spread diverges as R2 indicating that there is a strong spin delocalization. The spin-partitioned total position-spread can also be seen as a measure of how strong the electron correlation is.  Properties  The total position-spread is a cumulant and thus it possesses the following properties: # Cumulants can be explicitly represented only by moments of lower or equal order. # Cumulants are a linear combination of the products of these moments of lower or equal order. # Cumulants are additive. This is a very important property when studying molecular systems because it means that the total position-spread tensor shows size consistency. # A diagonal element of the cumulant tensor is the variance (see also this article), and it is always a positive value. # Cumulants also are invariant under the translation of the origin of when they are of order ‚â• 2\\\\. The total position-spread tensor being a second-order cumulant, is invariant under the translation of the origin. # The total position-spread is more sensitive to the variation of the wave function than the energy, which makes it a good indicator for instance in a Metal‚Äìinsulator transition situation.

She even runs a school where she teaches them. One day, while giving roll call in a class, she notices one of her lambs is missing. She then abandons her teaching session, and goes out to find the lost one. Out in the open, the missing lamb is playing with some blossoms instead of attending school. She is momentarily spotted by a jackal in luxury car. To deceive the lamb, the jackal, disguised as a person in a mask, greets and offers her a ride. But the lamb is uninterested and just walks away. In his second plan, the jackal dresses as a sheep and carries a picnic basket. He then asks the lamb if she would like to come along. This time the lamb accepts. Meanwhile, the lady shepherd, after being unable to locate her lamb, comes to a detective agency owned by Krazy Kat. When he hears about her problem, Krazy takes out a pair of hounds, and sets off. Up on a hill in the open, the missing lamb and the jackal, who's still in his sheep disguise, are having their \\"picnic.\\" Eventually, Krazy and the hounds come to the scene. Krazy warns the lamb that her companion is actually a vicious jackal. When the lamb is doubtful of the idea, the hounds rush forth at the impostor sheep, tearing up his disguise. Upon getting exposed, the jackal quickly picks up the lamb, and flees in a nearby car. Krazy and the hounds go on a chase and struggle to rescue the lamb. Moments later, the agitated lamb strikes the jackal who then loses control, causing both of them to be thrown out of the car. And before he could do anything else, the jackal is tackled by the hounds. Krazy returns to the lady shepherd's school, dragging the jackal with him.

The film's narrative revolves around an attorney forced to defend an unsavory criminal after her daughter is kidnapped. It stars Aishwarya Rai and Irrfan Khan in the lead roles, with Shabana Azmi, Atul Kulkarni, Jackie Shroff and Chandan Roy Sanyal in supporting roles. It is a remake of the 2007 South Korean film Seven Days.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday- times/Food-to-lingo-India-goes-on-a-K-trip/articleshow/55641575.cms The film was released on 9 October 2015 and turned out to be financially profitable. The film marked Aishwarya's return on screen after a five-year break. Rai's performance received nominations for Best Actor in an Action Role at 2015 Big Star Entertainment Awards and in 2016, Screen Award for Best Actress (Popular Choice). She won Power-packed performance of the year at Stardust Awards. Plot Anuradha Verma (Aishwarya Rai) is a prominent criminal lawyer and a single mother who has never lost a case. On the day of a parent-child race organized in her daughter Sanaya's (Sara Arjun) school, Sanaya is kidnapped. The kidnapper contacts Anuradha and tells her that she has to defend a convicted felon in order to get her daughter back. Anuradha lies to family and friends, saying that Sanaya is safe at her grandmother's house, so that the law is not involved. The felon is Niyaaz Shaikh (Chandan Roy Sanyal) who is convicted for the rape and murder of a young woman named Sia (Priya Banerjee), and the case against him is set for judgement in four days. The kidnapper keeps track of Anuradha very closely to make sure that she complies with all demands. All evidence suggests that Niyaaz is the murderer, and so Anuradha has to work hard to win the case, and with time running out, she tries to get help from her police friend Yohan (Irrfan Khan), who has been suspended from the police force by other corrupt officers for flouting the rules and regulations too often. The case against Niyaaz is being closely monitored by powerful politician Mahesh Maklai (Jackie Shroff). Mahesh asks renowned public prosecutor (Atul Kulkarni), who has been defeated by Anuradha in the past, to take up the case as rape is a critical issue the current government is fighting. Anuradha tries to gather information by hook or crook, including lying to Sia's mother Garima Chaudhary (Shabana Azmi). Anuradha discovers that Mahesh's son, Sam (Siddhanth Kapoor), was Sia's boyfriend, and Niyaaz was their drug dealer. Niyaaz had raped and killed Sia after delivering drugs to her home, during which time Sam was intoxicated and passed out. As Anuradha returns home one evening, she is taken hostage by Mahesh Maklai and his henchmen. She is tied up as the politician explains to her that Sam panicked and contacted him to help him get rid of Sia's dead body. Cutting the gas pipes and planning to set the home on fire, the home intruders leave Anuradha bound and gagged on the floor. However she is able to untie her hands and feet, remove the tape from her mouth and escape. Anuradha is able to get Niyaaz out on bail due to lack of evidence and also implicates Mahesh and Sam as co-conspirators of the murder, thus destroying the political career of Mahesh. Sanaya is freed by the kidnapper. As Yohan and Anuradha continue digging, they realise that Garima is behind the kidnapping of her daughter. Garima forced Anuradha to defend Niyaaz, so that he could be freed. Garima then kidnapped Niyaaz and burned him alive, since she finds the death sentence or life imprisonment to be insufficient punishment for someone who brutally raped and murdered her daughter. Anuradha, though initially infuriated after finding out the truth, offers her services as a lawyer to Garima after she is apprehended by police.

Reception =Critical reception= Meena Iyer of The Times of India gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated \\"Jazbaa's narrative has pace and power. Aishwarya is rusty at the start but eventually takes charge of the dual aspects of her character. Once in the groove, her eyes breathe fire. Irrfan breezes past with clap-trap Kamlesh Pandey dialogues and Shabana is flawless.\\" Daily News and Analysis rated the film with 3.5 stars out of 5 and commented \\"What makes Jazbaa a satisfying experience is it's fast-paced, taut and has a run time of two hours, allowing you little time to think. The court-room scenes are brilliant, Aishwarya looks gorgeous and gutted as the scene requires her to be, but it is the supporting cast who lift the film several notches above.\\" Zee News gave a rating of 3.5 stars out of 5 noted \\"Overall, 'Jazbaa' is compelling and an ensemble that lived up-to its expectation. For Aishwarya ‚ÄìThe age-appropriate role was pulled off impeccably and she also showed a few action stunts\\". Sonia Chopra from Sify gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and noted \\"Despite the story being highly far-fetched, the film is still arresting for its pacy storytelling, actors who perform with conviction, and a few interesting surprises in the finale. Worth a watch!.\\" Filmfare rated 3 stars out of 5, praised the performances of all the actors and noted \\"The film steams up some good thrills and then throws a bucket full of sentimentality over them and douses them out. Aishwarya performance as a confident lawyer but vulnerable mother is fantastic.\\" The Guardian also gave the film 3 stars, and mentioned \\"For all the rot Gupta dwells on, there's something refreshing about Jazbaa within the wider Bollywood context: it'll make for brisk, pacy, adult entertainment.\\" Bollywood Hungama gave it 3 stars, stating \\"Aishwarya Rai Bachchan with her 'initially-rusty-later spellbinding' performance, carries the film on her shoulders. On the whole, JAZBAA is a captivating thriller with good performances that make it a decent one-time watch.\\" Mid Day rated 3 stars and noted \\"Sanjay Gupta had gone a little easy on the unnecessary and intrusive melodrama. Even then, it's a good one time watch for sure. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan perfectly looks the part and even does a fairly decent job, barring certain emotional scenes where she clearly goes over the top.\\" Writing for Hindustan Times, Rohit Vats gave a rating of 3 stated, \\"The film is a well paced thriller, but primary characters' penchant for invoking whistles dilutes the thrill to some extent. Aishwarya Rai and Irrfan will take you to a new territory and then keep you there for most of its 130-minute duration. Jazbaa is a good watch this weekend.\\" Gayatri Gauri from Firstpost said \\"The screenplay moves fast in a gripping enough thriller mode. Gupta displays his old penchant for slick action and weaves a fairly engrossing tale.\\" IANS gave the film 3.5 stars commented that \\"With ample thrill and entertainment, this one is a good weekend watch. Aishwarya, seen on screen after a long hiatus, has a pivotal role, which she dons to perfection. However, the picture-perfect designing of the film is over-egged, giving the film a glossy, albeit, synthetic and unreal look.\\" Subhash K. Jha said that \\"It's a hardhitting unconstitutional message, packaged and projected with a precarious panache peculiar to Sanjay Gupta's cinema. The shared moments between Aishwarya and Shabana Azmi are a marvel to behold.\\" On the contrary, Shomini Sen from CNN-IBN criticised the film for its melodramatic, high pitched and unintentionally funny dialogues and wrote \\"Jazbaa scores only because of the performances. Aishwarya Rai grunts and screeches on some scenes but manages to deliver a convincing performance.\\" Ananya Bhattacharya writing for India Today gave 2.5 stars criticized Gupta's direction and wrote \\"The problem with Jazbaa lies in the overdose of melodrama and dialogues that make your ears bleed. One aspect that works in favour of the film is Jazbaa does raise some pertinent questions about the way justice is (un)delivered in the country. Watch Jazbaa for the performances.\\" The Koimoi reviewer, Surabhi Redkar rated 2.5 stars out of 5 said \\"Jazbaa does not promise anything extraordinary. If you have missed Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in films, here is a treat for you. Irrfan Khan fans will certainly enjoy.\\" Saibal Chatterjee from NDTV gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and stated \\"Jazbaa is a slick production all right and it does deliver a few thrilling moments and an above-average climax. Overall, Jazbaa feels like a wasted effort, a clear case of superficial style triumphing over substance by a fair distance. But it has just enough for Aishwarya Rai Bachchan fans to justify a trip to the multiplexes.\\" Sukanya Verma of Rediff gave 2 stars and described the film as \\"A mostly watchable thriller marred by its director Sanjay Gupta's penchant for excesses.\\" =Box office= The film collected nett on its first day.

It was founded in 1935 and closed in 2007, when the site and school roll was taken over by Spires Academy. Foundation as Central School Frank Montgomery School was founded in 1935. The school mainly took in children from the senior classes of existing schools in the nearby farming villages of Sturry and Westbere, and the coal mining village of Hersden.'Book charts the history of local schools', in The Kentish Gazette (UK newspaper), 16 September 2010 It was originally named Sturry Central School. Mr G.E. Draper-Hunt was the first headmaster, remaining in post until his retirement in 1958.Gerry Warren, 'Pupils Leave a Bit of Past Behind at New School' in The Kentish Gazette (UK newspaper), 21 June 2012 Until its replacement by Spires Academy school in 2007, the school's uniform of bottle green, and shield showing the white horse of the county of Kent, a coal mine tower and wheat sheaves, with the motto Strive for the Right, remained the same. When it opened in 1935 the school was hailed as a model for future school building design being the first in the local school district to be built entirely on one level.Dover Express (UK newspaper), 5 July 1935 The building cost was ¬£12,548 and was officially opened by Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne, an admirer of Rudolf Steiner and a sportsman who competed in the 1920 Summer Olympics.Dover Express (UK newspaper), 10 January 1936 The stated aim of the school on opening was to specialise in 'practical education, such as cookery, laundry, gardening, woodwork, metalwork and practical geography'. The initial school roll was 200 pupils, taught by the headmaster and six other teachers, with an initial maximum capacity for up to 280 pupils. Secondary modern school With the enactment of the 1944 Education Act the school was designated a secondary modern school, known as Sturry County Secondary Modern School. It changed its name to The Frank Montgomery School in 1980 As a secondary modern school the Frank Montgomery School was a non-selective school which meant it almost exclusively took in pupils who had failed to pass the controversial eleven-plus exam, also known as the Kent Test, set by Kent County Council to stream children to attend either selective grammar schools or non-selective secondary modern schools. According to Anthony Sampson, in his book Anatomy of Britain (1965), there were structural problems within the testing process that underpinned the eleven plus which meant it tended to result in secondary modern schools being overwhelmingly dominated by the children of poor and working class parents, while grammar schools were dominated by the children of wealthier middle class parents. To some extent the Frank Montgomery School corresponded to this pattern by being dominated by poor and working class children, and by having both low academic expectations and poor examination results.Sampson, A. Anatomy of Britain Today, London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1965, p.195 Local community After it opened the school soon became a focus for local community life, being the location for numerous community events, including the Seventh Annual Kent Collieries Ambulance Challenge in 1938,Dover Express (UK newspaper), 12 August 1938 and hosting a visit by diplomats from the American Embassy in London in 1944.Whitstable Times and Herne Bay Herald (UK newspaper), 8 July 1944 The school was on the receiving end of bombing damage in 1942, during the Second World War.Whitstable Times and Herne Bay Herald (UK newspaper) 4 July 1942 In 1960 the school's girls' choir appeared on the Home Service of BBC Radio, singing on a programme called 'Let the People Sing', described by the Radio Times as 'A weekly contest between choirs from all over the United Kingdom.'Radio Times, 8 February 1960, p.34 The choir appeared on the programme again the following year.Radio Times, 1 March 1961, p.44 Progressive innovations and controversies One of the innovations put in place by the school upon its name change to Frank Montgomery School was an attempt to end the division of pupils into streamed classes, each defined by the presumed educational ability of pupils. Consequently, the school ceased to stream the pupils by ability and also abolished the six letter system previously designating each class, A to F, in which A had been the highest ability stream, and F the lowest ability stream. Instead year groups were designated by the first six letters of the school's name, F, R, A, N, K and M, and each class was officially assigned as being of equal ability. In 1987 Frank Montgomery School also featured on a controversial episode of the BBC television documentary series Panorama as an example of a school abolishing competitive sports.BBC (1987) Panorama, 'Is Your Child Fit For Life?', broadcast 9 March 1987. For comment on the controversial nature of this BBC programme see J. Evans, 'Defining a Subject: The Rise and Rise of the New PE?', in The British Journal of the Sociology of Education, vol. 11, no. 2, 1990, p.30f Controversy over the school erupted again in 1997 when its then headmaster, Rodney Freakes, was quoted as saying he was \\"impressed with the loyalty of the pupils to their teachers\\" following a riot by 200 pupils at the school in protest at the sacking of five of their teachers.'Governors in crisis talks at riot school', in The Daily Mail (UK newspaper), 12 May 1997 Special measures and closure Frank Montgomery School was placed in special measures in 1998 due to poor Ofsted inspection reports, although it left special measures five years later following intervention by the Local Education Authority and Ofsted. However, in 2004 the BBC reported that the school was still bottom in the national school league tables for GCSE examination results in England and Wales, with just 4% of pupils on the school roll achieving any GCSEs at grade C or above. Three years later, at the point of its closure, the school had risen from bottom place to thirteenth from bottom with 7% of pupils achieving the official requirement of five or more GCSE results at grade C or above, and 43% of pupils gaining at least one GCSE at grade C or above. The school returned to special measures in 2005 and remained there until its closure in 2007, at which point a new academy school, Spires Academy, was formed on the same campus, taking in the former pupils of Frank Montgomery.

Cartwright saying his sudden signing \\"\\"I've always had a close relationship with Garth so we spoke regularly, \\"we spoke in October and he mentioned it to me and I didn't really think too much about it, as time went on I thought about it more and more and thought it was a great opportunity for myself to improve as a player, at the start of the year it was getting closer to the footy season and I felt as though if I was going to stay there I wasn't going to get as much time on the field, If I was to improve as a player and get to where I want to be this was the best place to do it, \\"I'm going to be working hard and still fighting my way into the team here and earn the respect from everyone else.\\" In Round 1 of the 2018 NRL season, Cartwright made his club debut for the Gold Coast Titans against the Canberra Raiders, starting at lock in the 30-28 win at Robina Stadium. In round 6, Cartwright playing against his former club, Penrith Panthers with an upset 12-35 loss at Penrith Stadium. Following Gold Coast's Round 12 34-14 defeat by the Eastern Suburbs, Cartwright was demoted to reserve grade by coach Garth Brennan due to inconsistent form. Less than a day after being demoted, Cartwright broke his hand in a freak training accident and was ruled out for 3 weeks. =2019= In early 2019 Cartwright admitted not putting in enough hard work the previous year and hoped that in the 2019 season he could atone for a disappointing 2018. Cartwright made a total of 23 appearances and scored 3 tries for the Gold Coast in the 2019 NRL season as the club endured a horror year on and off the field. The Gold Coast managed to win only 4 games for the entire season and finished last claiming the Wooden Spoon. In the context of Cartwright's refusal to be vaccinated, it was reported that in 2019 Cartwright missed a game with the Titans after he came down with a bout of influenza. =2020= Cartwright initially refused the 2020 NRL season's mandatory flu vaccination on 'pro-choice' grounds creating a standoff with the NRL in Round 3. At the time Simon Brunsdon from Fox Sports said \\"he's no real loss to any team\\". Shortly before being permanently stood down from the team, Cartwright obtained medical documentation seeking an exemption from immunisation and was finally cleared to play, but had missed a week of training disadvantaging him from the starting lineup. On 17 September, Cartwright was released by the Gold Coast club effective immediately. Personal life Cartwright is the nephew of former Penrith Panthers and Salford player and former Gold Coast Titans coach, John Cartwright. His wife Shanelle Cartwright is a social media influencer. = Pregnancy and death of ex-girlfriend = On 6 March 2017, it was reported that Cartwright's ex- girlfriend had become pregnant to him. The woman later claimed she was pressured into terminating the pregnancy in exchange for $50,000. Cartwright reportedly sent text messages to the woman when he discovered she was pregnant saying, \\"You do realise there is no way I'll be at the birth? We won't keep in contact at all\\". Lou Zivanovic, who has links with the Panthers, was hired by Cartwright as a 'fixer' to assist with this personal matter. The woman went on to say \\"I felt I had no other option than to get rid of the baby, the pressure was relentless\\". She went on further to say, \\"I was bullied by Bryce and Lou. They showed no compassion toward the baby and me\\". His ex-girlfriend had previously been charged with stalking him in December of 2016 but the charges were subsequently dismissed. On 2 August 2017 she was found dead at her home in Western Sydney, and according to the police report her death was not believed to be suspicious. It came in the wake of Cartwright having private photos of himself being posted online which the media classified as revenge porn. She also allegedly sent explicit and threatening text messages to Cartwright.  Health and vaccination dissension  Cartwright has a substantial anti-vax following on social media and has been dubbed a \\"poster boy\\" for the anti-vax movement. = Family's alternative health views = Cartwright and his wife Shanelle reportedly suffer from \\"allergies and auto- immune disorders\\", and \\"don't trust hospitals\\". Both have made statements publicly which led to the media referring to them as 'anti-vaxxers', but Cartwright rejects this term, saying he is \\"pro-choice, pro-informed consent and pro-medical freedom\\". On immunisation they have been influenced by a discredited book written by American homoeopath Suzanne Humphries. His wife believes that the coronavirus is a \\"scam\\" and in the conspiracy theory that the flu shot increases its likelihood by 36%. Cartwright initially took some time to come around to his wife's belief that vaccines are harmful, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence contradicting this, and has now become a prominent critic of vaccines. Cartwright's wife has questioned the manliness of NRL players who have not supported his position on vaccines. In relation to their children and immunisation Cartwright's wife has stated, \\"They can go to school [so far] ... if the law changes, I'll home-school before I vaccinate\\". She has also said she will encourage her newborn go to the toilet in the garden rather than use nappies. Sports commentator Erin Molan condemned Cartwright's wife for publicly making an \\"incredibly dangerous\\" comparison between anti-vaxxers and Holocaust victims. The AMA President has warned against, and Gold Coast GPs have criticised the anti-vaccination messages spread by the Cartwright's saying they \\"don't have the right to put the rest of the public at risk either through their opinions or actions.\\" Ex- celebrities Koby Abberton, Isabel Lucas and Pete Evans rallied behind Cartwright in support of his anti-vaccination stance. = 2020 NRL flu-vax controversy = During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the NRL brought in strict new biosecurity measures in Round 3 to protect those in the game, including a code-wide request that players be vaccinated against the flu, as \\"any player that has any respiratory illness... potentially will take the whole team out.\\" Cartwright refused the vaccine, instead signing a waiver on 'pro-choice' grounds. He was stood down from the Titans after the Queensland Government stood by the flu vaccination measures previously agreed to by the NRL that 100% of players would be vaccinated prior to the competition restarting. Ten days later Cartwright provided medical documentation seeking an exemption and was given a last minute reprieve from suspension. NRL commentator Paul Kent said \\"Cartwright objected to getting the flu shot because he was pro-choice, next minute he has produced a letter from a doctor saying he had medical reasons after it became apparent that the Queensland government was not going to allow him to play... The whole thing is a cook up and anyone that can't see that is an idiot.\\" BuzzFeed reported that since entering the flu-vax standoff with the NRL Cartwright's social media following in anti-vax circles had grown substantially, and that the Bryce Cartwright Support Group on Facebook had \\"pivoted into general anti-vaccination campaigning\\" and had grown by more than 5,700 members during the standoff.

It existed in the USSR from the mid 1940s until the late 1980s. Many famous composers and musicians at the beginning of studies were students of these Seminars. For example, Vladimir Dashkevich and Aleksander Averkin, and others. : The idea of such state institutions grew out of the Leningrad branch of the Union of composers of the USSR in the mid 1940s immediately after the great Patriotic War. One of the most prominent ascetics of this idea was the composer and musical activist, son of Gregor Admoni, Johann Admoni. Later (from 1949), he became head of the Leningrad Seminar of Amateur composers.  The Leningrad Seminar of Amateur composers  The Leningrad Seminar of Amateur composers was located in the building of the House of composers in Leningrad (now Saint-Petersburg), Herzen street (today Bolshaya Morskaya street), the house 45. Seminar Manager - Johann Admoni, composer and musical activist, son of Gregor Admoni. Known seminarians - Vladimir Dashkevich, Aleksander Averkin, Evgeny Kliachkin, Vladimir Anisimoff, and others. : After a successful experience with participation The Leningrad Seminar of Amateur composers such workshops have appeared in other cities of the USSR. For example, in Moscow at the Moscow organization of the Union of Soviet Composers of the USSR. The seminars were acting within the framework of the Statutes of the Union of composers. This allowed students-seminarians to act in different musical secondary and higher educational institutions. In particular, students-seminarians passed examinations in the Leningrad Conservatory and Moscow Conservatory on a general basis, but they had a great knowledge in the field of music. : At least two dozen composers-graduates of Conservatories were students of the Seminar in start. An important feature of Seminars - the same professors of the Conservatory taught almost all important musical discipline on an optional basis in Seminars. This allowed participants to actually receive the full amount of the Conservatory knowledge, but without giving them the state Diploma. The last fact in the USSR was very important for the further work of musicians. This forced many of them formally to graduate from the Conservatory. However, at least four seminarians of the Leningrad Seminar of the holder of the mid 1970s became a notable musicians without a Diploma of the Conservatory.

Its estimated membership in 2016 is 1300 who are scientists or laypersons interested in science. According to the Society. The GWUP annually hosts a conference with varying key subjects.  Goals and themes  The GWUP regards the critical contemplation of unproven claims in fields such as parasciences, esotericism, superstition, religion and alternative medicine as its main goal. It strives to achieve enlightenment in the sense of popular education and consumer protection. The GWUP underlines the importance of scientific procedures and critical thinking for societal challenges. Besides a theoretical dispute, individuals like dowsers, telekinetics, proponents of energized water scams, practitioners of alternative medicine and astrologers are being criticised and their skills also partially put to empirical examination. The stated goal of the GWUP is the promotion of critical thinking and the sciences including their methods. Scientific methods should be disseminated, made understandable and applied to parasciences, pseudosciences as well as related belief systems. This also includes educating the general public about the current state of scientific knowledge about parascientific claims. The GWUP puts a strong emphasis on health topics like complementary and alternative medicine, especially homeopathy. In these areas critical attention is highly indicated, since belief in these inefficacious methods leads to omission of more effective treatments. Furthermore, the GWUP discusses occultism, spiritism, esotericism and ideologies that underlie e.g. anthroposophy. Additionally they cover topics like religion, faith, superstition and creationism. Astrology, fortune-telling and prophecies are scrutinised in a yearly prognosis check. Further topics are conspiracy theories, paratechnologies, cryptozoology, ancient astronauts and UFOs. In Germany, the GWUP has also engaged in school politics. In 2012, it tried to prevent a state school in Hamburg from experimenting with Waldorf education. Open letter of the GWUP Science Council. The open letter of the GWUP Science Council demanded \\"to put an enlightened, modern and scientific worldview at the centre of school education instead of esoteric doctrines, without fuss or quibble.  Organisation  The GWUP headquarters in Ro√üdorf. The GWUP was founded as an Eingetragener Verein in Bonn on 11 October 1987. It is recognised in Germany as a charitable organisation for its dedication to popular education, and it is headquartered in Ro√üdorf near Darmstadt. Since 2008, its chairperson is electrical engineer and CSI fellow Amardeo Sarma, who also presided the European Council of Skeptical Organisations in 2000‚Äì2013. The GWUP regards itself as the oldest and largest skeptics' organisation in German-speaking Europe and considers itself to be part of the international skeptical movement. As its predecessor organisations, the GWUP cites the informal Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Skeptiker zur Untersuchung von Pseudowissenschaften und Okkultem (ASUPO, \\"Working Community of Skeptics for the Investigation of Pseudosciences and Occultism\\", founded on 7 February 1987) and the Deutsche Gesellschaft zur Bek√§mpfung des Kurpfuschertums (\\"German Society for Fighting Quackery\\", founded in 1903, outlawed by the Nazis in 1934). The Society has a scientific advisory council at its disposal, currently presided by Peter Kr√∂ling and Wolfgang Hell. The Science Council has an interdisciplinary composition and comprises scientists, scholars and other people from fields such as medicine, psychology, physics, religious studies, biology, pedagogy, folkloristics and cultural anthropology. The Science Council is intended to secure the scientific standards of the Society's work. A representative of the Science Council is delegated to the GWUP board of directors for this purpose. In Ro√üdorf the GWUP maintains the Centre for Science and Critical Thinking (Zentrum f√ºr Wissenschaft und kritisches Denken), that is led full-time by Martin Mahner. Amongst other issues, inquiries by journalists and interested people are answered here. It was founded in 1999 and has around 200 enquiries per year. It contains a reference library. Several regional groups of the GWUP exist in Germany and Austria. They are located in Berlin, Essen (for the metropolitan region Rhine- Ruhr), Hamburg, Cologne, Munich, Stuttgart, W√ºrzburg, Vienna and Untersberg (for the region Salzburg/Freilassing). The Viennese group appears in public as Gesellschaft f√ºr kritisches Denken (Society for Critical Thinking). Website of the Gesellschaft f√ºr kritisches Denken  Activities  = Conferences = Since 1989 the GWUP yearly hosts a conference to make the outcome of their efforts visible to the public. In July 2011 the conference took place with the title \\"Fact or Fiction\\" in the Museum of Natural History in Vienna and the Vienna University of Technology. In 2012 the GWUP hosted the 6th World Skeptics Congress from 18‚Äì20 May in Berlin. In 2013, the conference was arranged in Cologne and was named \\"SkepKon\\" for the first time./ The 2014 conference was arranged in Munich. 2015 the conference took effect in Frankfurt, while the next two years saw them in Hamburg and Berlin. 2018 SkepKon took place in Cologne again. Notable speakers included Natalie Grams, Lydia Benecke, Anna Zakrisson and Nikil Mukerji. The 2019 SkepKon took place in Augsburg. = Das Goldene Brett vorm Kopf = The ironic award Das Goldene Brett vorm Kopf (de) is awarded yearly in Vienna. During the 2011 GWUP- conference in Vienna, it was given for the first time, to film director Peter A. Straubinger for his pseudoscientific documentary In the Beginning There Was Light about breatharianism. Straubinger received the award personally. In 2012 the prize was awarded to Harald Walach. The lifetime achievement award was bestowed to Erich von D√§niken. In 2013 the prize was awarded to the organisation \\"Homeopaths Without Borders\\". = Psi test = The Centre for Science and Critical Thinking. Since 2004, the GWUP annually performs experiments to test purported paranormal skills. Initially the experiments were conducted in concordance with James Randi as part of the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, later independently. The reward for proof of paranormal abilities is a prize money of 10,000 Euros. The testing procedure is agreed upon in advance between the applicant and the GWUP. Until 2010, around 30 candidates have applied to be tested for their psi abilities, most of them dowsers. As of 2014 no one has successfully passed the challenge. The most recent Psi test was conducted on 12 August 2013 in the University of W√ºrzburg. Again no test person was able to verify any paranormal ability. The journalist and psychologist Sebastian Bartoschek observed this test. = Prognosis check = Since 2002 the mathematician Michael Kunkel yearly publishes a retrospection on the astrological predictions of the past year The predictions are published on Wahrsagercheck (\\"Fortuneteller Check\\"). The predictions are mainly from the Internet (about 70%) while predictions in print (newspapers, magazines and books) make up the other 30%. In 2010, 110 predictions from more than 60 fortunetellers and astrologers were evaluated. = Homeopathy / 10:23 Campaign = The GWUP is a well-known critic of homeopathy. In the year 2005, a petition was initiated against the special treatment of homeopathy as a healing method in Germany. In 2011, the GWUP participated in the international 10:23 Campaign, in which critics of homeopathy took an overdose of highly potentised homeopathic dilutions in public, serving as a warning against the unscientific foundation of homeopathy and the scientifically disproven homeopathic products. In 2014, the GWUP was mentioned as main critic of the planned bachelor's degree course in homeopathy in Traunstein by several newspapers. Dr. Norbert Aust was quoted as saying: \\"Homeopathy lacks the ambition of a science to study its own foundations. Research in homeopathy aims only to refute the allegation of ineffectiveness\\", while GWUP chairman Amardeo Sarma remarked that \\"the proposed College of Homeopathy in Traunstein is academic fraudulent labelling and gives a pseudoscience a higher reputation\\". In April 2014 the implementation of this course was discontinued. In May 2018, GWUP issued an invitation to individuals and groups to respond to its challenge \\"to identify homeopathic preparations in high potency and to give a detailed description on how this can be achieved reproducibly.\\" The first participant to correctly identify selected homeopathic preparations under an agreed-upon protocol will receive ‚Ç¨50,000. = Skeptics in the Pub = Regular lectures in a pub atmosphere about scientific skeptical topics are held in Hamburg, Berlin and Cologne. There are currently over a 100 groups worldwide conducting this informal meeting format known as Skeptics in the Pub. = Fellows of GWUP = Since 2018, the German Skeptic journal Skeptiker listed Fellow Board members of international importance for the Skeptic movement. They are: * Susan Blackmore * Mario Bunge * Edzard Ernst * Krista Federspiel * Kendrick Frazier * Harriet Hall * Britt Marie Hermes * Bernhard Ho√´cker * Wolfgang Hund * Irmgard Oepen * Elizabeth Loftus * Mark Lynas * James Randi * Simon Singh * Susan Gerbic * Steven Novella * Eugenie C. Scott = Publications, blogs and social media = Since 1987, the Gesellschaft's quarterly journal Skeptiker publishes articles and interviews that are about the core of the organisation's interests. As of 2011, Skeptiker has 2200 subscribers; its managing editor is Inge H√ºsgen. The GWUP and several of its members also maintain broadly themed skeptical blogs. The blogs serve the organisation as a supplement to its magazine Skeptiker.  Notable members  Lydia Benecke * Edzard Ernst * Natalie Grams * Holm Gero H√ºmmler * Walter Kr√§mer * Heinz Oberhummer * Irmgard Oepen * Amardeo Sarma * Gerhard Vollmer  Reception in the media  Actions of the GWUP are regularly featured in editor's pieces of the Germanophone mass media. For example, the psi tests of the GWUP and the 2004 One Million Dollar Challenge were presented in the WDR programme Quarks & Co, amongst others. Especially immediately before and during the conference, daily newspapers and online media report on the topics and backgrounds. GWUP members are often invited as experts on television shows about subjects with which the organisation is concerned, for example, Heinz Oberhummer on the topic ‚ÄûWieviel Unvernunft vertr√§gt die Wissenschaft?‚Äú (\\"How much irrationality can science tolerate?\\") in the Servus TV programme Talk im Hangar-7, Alt URL Amardeo Sarma was a guest in the ARD programme Menschen bei Maischberger about ‚ÄûSeher und Propheten‚Äú (\\"Clairvoyants and Prophets\\"), Klaus Schmeh at the clairvoyance casting in the RTL programme Punkt 12, Bernd Harder in the SWR programme Menschen der Woche about the \\"end of the world\\" predictions concerning 2012. Alt URL In 2008, a television documentary about the GWUP's psi tests was shown. The film aired on several television stations within German-speaking Europe under the title ‚ÄûAlles fauler Zauber!?

The purpose is to control the quality of the collected data. Data editing can be performed manually, with the assistance of a computer or a combination of both. Editing methods =Interactive editing= The term interactive editing is commonly used for modern computer- assisted manual editing. Most interactive data editing tools applied at National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) allow one to check the specified edits during or after data entry, and if necessary to correct erroneous data immediately. Several approaches can be followed to correct erroneous data: *Recontact the respondent *Compare the respondent's data to his data from previous year *Compare the respondent's data to data from similar respondents *Use the subject matter knowledge of the human editor Interactive editing is a standard way to edit data. It can be used to edit both categorical and continuous data.Waal, Ton de et al. \\"Handbook of Statistical Data Editing and Imputation\\". Wiley publication, 2011,p.15. Interactive editing reduces the time frame needed to complete the cyclical process of review and adjustment. =Selective editing= Selective editing is an umbrella term for several methods to identify the influential errors, the errors that have substantial impact on the publication figures and outliers.values that do not fit a model of data well Selective editing techniques aim to apply interactive editing to a well-chosen subset of the records, such that the limited time and resources available for interactive editing are allocated to those records where it has the most effect on the quality of the final estimates of publication figures. In selective editing, data is split into two streams: *The critical stream *The non-critical stream The critical stream consists of records that are more likely to contain influential errors. These critical records are edited in a traditional interactive manner. The records in the non-critical stream which are unlikely to contain influential errors are not edited in a computer assisted manner.Waal, Ton de et al. \\"Handbook of Statistical Data Editing and Imputation\\". Wiley publication, 2011,p.16. =Macro editing= There are two methods of macro editing: Aggregation method This method is followed in almost every statistical agency before publication: verifying whether figures to be published seem plausible. This is accomplished by comparing quantities in publication tables with same quantities in previous publications. If an unusual value is observed, a micro-editing procedure is applied to the individual records and fields contributing to the suspicious quantity. Distribution method Data available is used to characterize the distribution of the variables. Then all individual values are compared with the distribution. Records containing values that could be considered uncommon (given the distribution) are candidates for further inspection and possibly for editing.Bethlehem,J. \\"Applied Survey Methods A Statistical Perspective \\".

Purpose  The purpose of the Association is: * to establish and promote dialogue on sustainable agriculture, * to support and develop sustainable agriculture at European level through the implementation of integrated farming, * to bring together a broad range of organisations in Europe to support and develop sustainable agriculture as well as practical, progressive and modern farming methods. The \\"EISA Integrated Farming Framework\\" is one focal point of the organisation's activities.EISA Integrated Farming Framework Further activities include intensive participation in European stakeholder dialogues and workshops as well as publicity measures on integrated farming on the European level.  EISA Integrated Farming Framework  A first working paper on such a European definition and characterisation of integrated farming was presented by EISA in July 2003. Following discussions with a wide range of European experts, a second draft was published in November 2005, and the fine-tuned full paper in September 2006. However, following EISA's understanding of integrated farming as an equally holistic and dynamic system, EISA members have decided to review and update the framework on a regular basis. Updated versions were since presented in September 2009 and in February 2012. In this detailed guideline, integrated farming is characterised as sustainable production system which allows farmers to optimise their farm management, to raise further awareness and continually improve everyday practice on farm in order to meet future environmental, economic and social challenges and hence achieve parallel progress in all dimensions of sustainable development.

Biography Baptiste was born in British Guiana (now Guyana) as the son of a wealthy landowner. He moved to Britain in the late 1940s. His one contact was the Labour MP Tom Driberg, who helped him gain factory employment, and Baptiste enrolled at Morley College in Lambeth to study music followed by scholarships to the National School of Opera and Royal Academy of Music. Baptiste joined Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop early in its existence. Baptiste appeared in a production of No√´l Coward's Nude with Violin for two years from 1956 with John Gielgud, Patience Collier and Kathleen Harrison, first in Dublin and then the West End. In 1960, he played Riley in the first professional production of Harold Pinter's The Room and in a production directed by Pinter himself who had wanted to cast Baptiste in the role. It became an episode of ITV's Television Playhouse broadcast in October 1961. In 1963, Baptiste played the first Black character to appear in Coronation Street, a bus conductor who was falsely sacked as a result of a racist altercation with Len Fairclough. Fable (1965) was an episode of The Wednesday Play written by John Hopkins which imagined Britain as a mirror apartheid society with Barbara Assoon playing his wife as she had done in Coronation Street. Alun Owen's drama Pal (Play for Today, 1971), of which no recording survives, was the first British television play to feature a black gay character. Meanwhile on stage during the 1960s, he played Doolittle in Pygmalion and George in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. Later, he played Paul Robeson, who he admired greatly, in Are You Now or Have You Ever Been? at the Birmingham Rep in 1978, a production which transferred to Mayfair. In the 1960s, he co-founded an advisory committee of the British Actors' Equity Association, to represent black actors in Britain. In an interview which appeared in 1992, Baptiste said that he thought black actors were having even more difficulty beginning their careers than he had done forty years earlier.

It was directed by Homi Wadia and produced by Wadia Movietone. It starred Fearless Nadia, John Cawas, Radha Rani, Sayani Atish, Sardar Mansur, Dalpat, Kunjru, and Boman Shroff. This film was the seventh in the Diamond thriller series with the first being Veer Bharat in 1934, directed by Homi Wadia under the production of J. B. H. Wadia. It is cited as one of the best films produced by the Wadia brothers. The film's success saw Homi Wadia becoming a producer by which he was able to obtain raw stock for his films due to the rationing of two films per producer during the Second World War. Plot The film is set in Diamond Town where Madhurika returns following five years of studies in Bombay. She is the Bambaiwali the townspeople have been waiting to see. She returns to her town wearing western clothes and looking fit and to her father's query she replies that she's been working out in the Bombay gymnasiums. The town is reeling under the brutal atrocities of the mustachioed bushy eye-browed villain, Kedarnath (Sayani Atish) who has usurped the Prince's place while he is away. Kedarnath had been given charge by authorities to weed out corruption but is instead heavily into corruption, taxing people and outrages against women. He also has an enemy in the dacoit Diler as he cheated Diler's father many years ago. Diler was the sole survivor in his family when Kedarnath burnt his family home. He had been given a dying oath by his father to take revenge against Kedarnath. Madhurika joins up with the dacoit Diler and manages to deliver the town from the evil Kedarnath. She advocates for women's literacy and independence and uses dialogues like: 'If the nation is to be freed, the women have to be free first.' CastFearless Nadia as Madhurika *John Cawas as Diler Daku *Sayani Atish as Kedarnath *Boman Shroff *Radha Rani *Sardar Mansur *Fatima *Dalpat *Kunjru Production The film dealt with women's emancipation and showed Nadia minus her mask and whip.Kaur, p. 46 Although based on the Pearl White character of \\"Perils of Pauline\\", especially in Hunterwali,Kaur, p. 59 similarities were reduced in Diamond Queen. The films made under Wadia Movietone by Homi Wadia and starring Nadia had several commonalities like her hero John Cawas and Boman Shroff, a horse called Punjab ka Beta (Son of Punjab), an Austin car and a dog called Gunboat. During the filming, Nadia did most of her stunts herself. According to one report B. K. Karanjia visited her on the sets of Diamond Queen and found her doing all her stunts, and enjoying herself in the process. Reception The film was a considerable success at the box office and also garnered critical acclaim. The Filmindia editorial by Baburao Patel in 1940 called it \\"a thought-provoking film that enlightens as it entertains\\".

History  Zimdancehall which is a subgenre of reggae/dancehall music from Zimbabwe, started in the late '80s with the rising up of local sound systems like A1 Sound, Startime sound which exposed mic chanters like Culture T, Allan Ranks, and Dudz (who was way ahead of his time) to ride on riddims imitating their Jamaican icons at the same time creating their own style. In the 1990s as dancehall took over with artists like Tiger, Shabba Ranks, Supercat, Ninjaman , Papa San and a new crop of MCs began to emerge with the likes of Major E, Rassie Ai, Booker T, Smylie, Potato, Yappie Banton, Daddy Distress, Kuda Culture (brother to Culture T) dominating the sound systems. Startime Supa Power was the first sound system to push most of these artists to record their songs, starting first with dubplates the most popular being 'Sounds of the '90s by Major E & Booker T on Hypocrite Riddim instrumental side of Daddy Freddie & Micheal Prophet song with the same title and Rassie Ai ft Booker T 'Svinurai/Vanofarira Startime' on the Pepperseed Riddim. The popularity of these recordings led to more studio recordings with Major E & Booker T releasing a 7\\" vinyl single of 'Sound of the 90's', Yappie Banton releasing Memories and Water ina mi room. The biggest achievement was by Culture T with the band Transit Crew releasing top-selling albums and toured Europe. By the end of the 90s, a number of local youths were recording singles and albums independently and reggae bands like Cruxial Mix (Trevor Hall) and Black Roots holding regular weekly shows to showcase various artists like Potato, Daddy Ray, Ijah son, Jnr Banton, Slaggy Yout, Bobo Markos, Desert Eagle, Sanchez and more. During the early 2000s, there were guys like Menace Dose who had some success on radio with a tune called \\"Vanomira Hoo\\". These guys went on to record several tunes on riddims at WayOut studio with THead. It's at WayOutRecords in Chitungwiza that early dancehall artists like Badman, Expatriot, Thembalami. King Labash and several others started releasing songs on riddims which is the same concept as Jamaica The genre was always cast as a copy cat of Jamaican culture and way of life so it was never taken seriously and recording studios shunned it saying it does not appeal or sell. It was not until the emergence of independent studios and the arrival of urban grooves in 2001 that opened up the doors for many artists with the release of many various artists albums like 'the future' 'Chamhembe','Chigutiro' which paved the way for artists like Trinta and Sniper Storm. Sniper Storm went on to release the album 'Ndakabata Mic' in 2004 a hardcore dancehall album. What really separated this album from its predecessors was the fact that all its lyrics were in Shona and not English/Patios which proved really popular with the people creating a new direction for the genre. 2005 saw the rise of Winky D -arguably the most decorated artist in the genre- who released hit track after track under the It was not until 2006 that another artist Slaggy Yout who was now based in the UK renamed it to Zimdancehall after creating the first website dedicated to promoting the genre. This was the start of the movement and it was a period when Zimbabwe was going through a rough time with political and economic sanctions and most artists could not afford or gain access to the internet. In light of this, another artist based in Zimbabwe Mad Fisher had to personally collect tracks from artists and post them to the UK or upload in internet cafes with funding from the website. The website popularized the Zimdancehall genre as at that time none of the artists was getting any airplay whatsoever and promoters did not even bother to book and market the artists. It was individual promoters like Godfatha Templeman, Simmad and Silverstone Sound who arranged shows in the Ghetto. At the present moment, it has taken over the country and the region to a certain level with present chanters like Sniper Storm, Winky D, LXG, Di Topololo, Quonfused, rollerg, Seh Calaz, Soul Jah Love, Killer T, Elcee Gweja and others. This includes new mixtapes from sounds like black scorpion soundz based in Mutare, Judgement Yard, South African based DJ Travella, Festbwon Productions Generally Harare based. Other cities like Gweru Mkoba are also grooming youths through Eric Muzvidziwa and others. Producers include Sunshine family, Real Sound Records, Royal Sounds International Championed by Selekta Trooper (RUDD CHIMZ) and Mc Reggie D (Regis Mutapwa) Magweja, Ice and Roses, Chillspot, Cashlibs, Bodyslam 2.2.2.4 SoundmindZ; Zimtach Records; MAK Records(www.makrecords.com) and the long established Vigilance among others.

His mother, Lina Naomi Rubinstein, n√©e Lowy (died 1939) was the sister of Victor Gollancz's wife, Ruth. His father also wrote several plays, published by his brother-in-law Victor Gollancz. His elder brother Michael Rubinstein (1920‚Äì2001) also became a lawyer in the family firm, Rubinstein, Nash & Co, and acted for Penguin Books in its prosecution for obscenity after the publication of an uncensored version of D. H. Lawrence's novel Lady Chatterley's Lover in 1960. Rubinstein was educated at Cheltenham College. He did national service with the Royal Air Force between 1944 and 1947, and then studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Merton College, Oxford. He married Helge Kitzinger in 1955. Helge Rubinstein worked as a marriage guidance counsellor, published several cookery books, and founded the Ben's Cookies biscuit chain (named after their youngest son). They were close friends of politician Shirley Williams and her husband Bernard, living in the same house in West London together for a period. He was survived by his wife, their three sons, and one daughter, the literary agent Felicity Rubinstein. Career After university, Rubinstein became an editor at Gollancz. He encouraged the firm to publish Kingsley Amis's first novel Lucky Jim (Rubinstein and Amis had become acquainted at Oxford). He also expanded the firm's range of authors, adding science fiction written by J. G. Ballard, Robert Silverberg and Robert Heinlein. He worked at Gollancz for 13 years, from 1950 to 1963, and became a director in 1952, effectively becoming Victor Gollancz's deputy in 1954 after Sheila Hodges left. Eventually, Victor Gollancz appointed his daughter Livia Gollancz to succeed him in running the business. Conflicts with Gollancz led him to leave his job after 13 years. Rubinstein left to work at The Observer from 1963 until 1965, and served as the deputy editor of the newspaper's colour magazine when it launched in 1964. He then became a literary agent at the long-established firm A. P. Watt, where he represented many successful clients, including Quentin Blake, Nadine Gordimer, Jan Morris, Geoffrey Moorhouse, P. G. Wodehouse, and the estates of G. K. Chesterton, Robert Graves, Rudyard Kipling, Somerset Maugham, H. G. Wells, and W. B. Yeats. For Michael Holroyd, he secured an advance of more than ¬£600,000 from Chatto & Windus in 1987 for a four-volume biography of George Bernard Shaw. He also acted as agent for John Colville, private secretary to Winston Churchill, who published his memoirs The Fringes of Power: Downing Street Diaries 1939-1955. He compiled an anthology, The Complete Insomniac, which was published in 1974, and in 1978, he founded and compiled The Good Hotel Guide, published by Which? alongside The Good Food Guide founded in 1951 by Raymond Postgate. Rubinstein retired from AP Watt in 1992, but continued to work as a literary agent independently, controversially acting for Mary Bell, the 1960s child murderer, whose biography Cries Unheard written with Gitta Sereny was published in 1998. He was a member of the council of the Institute of Contemporary Arts from 1976 to 1992, he was a trustee of the Open College of the Arts from 1987 to 1996.

It is based on Chaucer's The Knight's Tale. Though the text of the play is lost, there is a detailed record of its structure and plot. The performance was a highly spectacular affair organised by staff and students of Oxford University. The event was vividly recalled and described by many contemporary witnesses. Context The play was created for a visit of the queen to Christ Church, Oxford, part of Oxford University. Edwardes was the courtier whose job it was to organise the Royal entertainments. He is usually credited as its author, but one writer at the time said that it was translated \\"from the Latin into the English tongue by Master Edwards and some other alumni of the college.\\"W. Y. Durand, Pub. Mod. Lang. Assoc. 20. 512. However, no Latin original is known, and the source (Chaucer) is English. No other source says this; the writer may be conflating the play with others performed at the same event, a comedy and a tragedy, both in Latin, written by Oxford scholars.F. E. Halliday, Shakespeare Companion, 1550-1950, Funk & Wagnalls, New York, 1952, p.2. The performance was spread over two days, 2 and 4 September 1566.Eugene M. Waith (ed), The Two Noble Kinsmen, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1989, p.28. According to Edwardes's biographer Albert Cook, the play was carefully crafted to appeal to Elizabeth, by emphasising the virginal purity of the heroine Emilia. But it was created at a time when Elizabeth was still young, and it was expected that she would marry at some point, as Emilia does at the end. The final scene was applauded and the queen gave a reward in gold coins (angels) to the actors in the principal female roles, Emilia and Hippolyta. The latter was performed by John Rainolds, who later became a leading Puritan, and recalled his youthful cross- dressing role with embarrassment.Kirby Farrell, Kathleen M. Swaim, The Mysteries of Elizabeth I: Selections from English Literary Renaissance, Univ of Massachusetts Press, 2003, p.37. Performance The actors were students and scholars of the university. Their performance was interrupted several times. Near the end, a spectator tried to intervene to stop the actors who he thought were recklessly destroying valuable items in a fire, which was part of the performance. At another point one of the actors, John Dalaper, completely forgot his lines, and apologised clumsily to the queen, who called him a \\"knave\\".Siobhan Keenan, \\"Spectator and Spectacle: Royal Entertainments at the Universities in the 1560s\\", in Jayne Elisabeth Archer, The Progresses, Pageants, and Entertainments of Queen Elizabeth I, Oxford University Press, New York, 2007, p.100. More seriously, an accident occurred resulting in three deaths. Due to the pressure from the crowd watching from surrounding buildings, a wall and a flight of stairs collapsed. In addition to the three deaths, five people were seriously injured as a result.Milton Waldman, Elizabeth and Leicester, Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1945, p.143. Despite the tragic accident, the show continued. Edwardes's \\"finessing\\" of the queen's virgin persona was a success. \\"The sequel shows that his finesse was a complete success, for the audience greeted the conclusion of the marriage- scene with a riot of applause ('incredibili spectatorum clamore et plausu'), and the Queen gave Emilia a reward of eight angels.\\"Albert S. Cook, The Life and Poems of Richard Edwards. Contributors,Yale University Press, 1927, p.76. The queen especially admired the performance of a scene in which the character was \\"gatheringe her flowers prettily in ye garden and singing sweetlie in ye pryme of March.\\" Plot Though the text was never published the plot was described in a Latin text by John Bereblock, a Fellow of Exeter College and artist, who recorded all the entertainments provided for the queen's visit. There are also records of conversations about the play, and comments by the queen on particular scenes. Albert S. Cook summarises Bereblock's account as follows: Part I *Palamon and Arcite, in prison, see Emilia, and quarrel over their love for her. *Escape of Arcite. ::::(Considerable time-interval here in Chaucer.) *Return of Arcite, who lives disguised as a servant in Emilia's household. *Escape of Palamon, who meets Arcite in the woods, and quarrels with him. *Intervention of Theseus, who ordains a tournament in forty days' time. Part 2 *Arrival of the two knights, with their friends and retainers. *The prayers of Palamon, Arcite, and Emilia. *The single combat won by Arcite. *The contention of the gods. *Saturn strikes Arcite with subterranean fire, as he goes in triumphal procession. *Funeral of Arcite, and marriage of Emilia to Palamon.

It was widely reported in the press in India as well as overseas. After an extensive investigation, CBI concluded that there was no gang rape and the suspects were released. However, on 28 October 2015 the POCSO court rejected the CBI closure report; it was a major setback for CBI. According to reports, in the evening the girls had gone out into a field that was used for open defecation and did not return. The police were notified, but initially took no action. Villagers searched for the girls throughout the night and they were found the following morning hanging from a tree. According to a post-mortem examination conducted earlier, it was reported that the girls had been raped and died from strangulation due to being hanged while still alive. However, according to a CBI investigation, no evidence of rape was found, and the initial examination, conducted by physician who had never conducted rape investigations before, was flawed. The girl's family and several activists rejected the CBI report as a cover-up \\"to avoid international shame and acceptance of the dismal law and order situation\\". The girl's family and others have charged that the local police attempted a cover-up of the incident due to the lower status of the family. Some of the earliest reports claimed that the family belong to a \\"Dalit\\" (untouchables) caste. Later reports contradicted the report of the victims belonging to the Dalit community. On 6 June 2014, the Indian government began a review of the case and determined that because \\"a concerted effort of a blame game has taken shape by the officials manning the administration\\" investigating the case, \\"it is necessary for the court to monitor the investigation\\". The case has gained both national and international attention. In a statement, the humanitarian organisation Save the Children India called the attack \\"part of an alarming trend of brutal violence against those from marginalised communities\\". The CBI announced in on 27 November 2014 that they have concluded that the two cousins were not sexually assaulted and murdered as police initially said, but took their own lives. Through the use of phone records it was established that the older girl was, in fact, having an affair with 20-year-old Pappu Yadav, with whom she had shared about 400 calls. Incident as initially reported The two teenage girls were cousins. They went missing on the evening of 26 May 2014, when they went out of their home and were alleged to have been abducted. It was alleged that the girls had gone into the fields because there was no toilet in their home. The parents of the girls immediately reported that the girls were missing, but allegedly their First Information Report was not lodged by the officers. According to some reports, Sohan Lal, father of one and uncle of the other victim, said that he went to the police station at around midnight begging for help in finding the girls, but that the two police officers on duty \\"mocked him, ripped up his complaint and told him to come back in the morning\\". Reports of the incident differ. Some reports said that a family relative had seen the abduction and reported the incident to the father of one of the girls. One news source stated that the father said that the family went to the accused's home and the accused admitted to abducting the girls but refused to release them. The father said that a policeman was present in the home at that time. Several hours later the girls' bodies were found hanging from a tree about one kilometre (0.6-mile) from their home. A large number of villagers had gathered at the site to prevent the police from removing the bodies for fear that the police would say that the girls had killed themselves. The families of the victims have asserted that the police are shielding the attackers. Investigation and initial arrests On 29 May 2014, Badaun's Superintendent of Police Man Singh Chouhan said that a post-mortem had found that the girls were raped and died from hanging, and that DNA samples had been taken to help identify the perpetrators. On 1 June, it was reported that three men, Pappu Yadav, Awdesh Yadav, and Urvesh Yadav, had been arrested and that they had confessed to the rape and murder of the girls, while the police continued to search for two additional suspects. Two police officers, Chhatrapal Yadav and Sarvesh Yadav, were charged with criminal conspiracy and discharged over the incident. However Pushpa Lata Pant, the doctor who did the post-mortem acknowledged that she had never done a post- mortem before, but did it because she was ordered. It was done at night, which is generally not permitted. On 8 June, Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police A. L. Banerjee said, \\"According to the postmortem report of the deceased, one of the girls was not raped and it appears to be a case of honour killing. We are probing the matter\\". Speaking to the press on that date, state chief secretary Alok Ranjan stated, \\"Rape is a trivial incident and it should not be blown out of proportion by the media. The media should also look into the incidents where people have been falsely implicated in such cases.\\" Speaking to the press on 12 June, Banerjee said that the girls were strangulated before death, and that there is a possibility that the accused could be innocent. According to Banerjee, the death of one of the girls may be related to property inheritance issues within the family: \\"Of the two victims, one was the lone child of her parents. Her father is one of three brothers with limited resources and if she was not alive, it could benefit others\\". The father of one of the girls responded saying, \\"We always knew the police was biased... They are trying to frame our family to save the accused who are all Yadavs. We will leave the village and go to Delhi to fight for justice\\". Gang rape allegations found false by CBI investigation On 6 June, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was set up by the government to probe the incident. The team visited the village and met with witnesses. On 12 June, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) began an investigation and registered a First information report of the case. On 8 July, a second autopsy of the girls bodies was ordered by the CBI. On 15 July, several news sources reported that the CBI is investigating \\"alleged inconsistencies\\" in the statements made by the families of the girls. Reportedly the CBI has recovered the slippers of the older girl which \\"are being seen as crucial evidence in the investigation into their death\\". According to the reports, \\"the family had allegedly withheld information on the whereabouts of a cellphone belonging to the older girl and about 20 days ago, gave it to the CBI in broken condition\\". The CBI has administered polygraph tests to both family members and the accused. The polygraph tests determined that the five accused had been telling the truth. However the chief witness Nazru alias Babburam failed the polygraph test. On 17 July, the CBI confirmed that it would exhume the bodies of the two victims on the 20th, subject to receiving the required approval from a court, based on a recommendation from the medical board of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to conduct another post mortem examination and continue with further investigation. However, on 20 July it was reported that the rising levels of water in the Ganges had flooded the graves resulting in the bodies not being found, thus making exhumation impossible. The CBI will instead use a DNA analysis of the girls' personal belongings and of the vaginal swabs taken at the time of their death. The alleged rape and murder case become murky when the families of the two victims told the CBI that the police FIR was filed on the basis of wrong statements given by Nazru, an uncle of the girls. Eventually, the family as well as Nazru told the CBI that the main accused Pappu, had not taken the two girls at gunpoint but rather fled when he was seen with the girls by Nazru. If was found that the parents gave Rs 100,000 each to the main eyewitness, Najru, and their third brother, from the Rs 500,000 that they had received as compensation for tragedy from the Bahujan Samaj Party. The mobile phone used by the sisters, was noticed by the CBI investigators from a photograph of the crime scene, seen tucked in the upper garments of the elder sister. A month later, the CBI had asked the family to produce the phone. The family first claimed that the phone has been lost and later provided a damaged mobile phone. The phone was then sent to Gujarat FSL which concluded, \\"the mobile phone was broken recently and intentionally by applying external force.\\" CBI found that the older girl and the main suspect of the alleged rape/murder had made contact by mobile phone around 300 times since 2013. On 26 August, a CBI spokesperson announced that they would not be filing a chargesheet against the five accused because forensic tests had ruled out sexual assault. The CBI did not rule out murder saying: \\"However, we have not a given clean chit to anyone. Though rape has been ruled out, murder has not. We are investigating the matter.\\" The father of one of the girls protested the ruling saying that one of the accused had publicly confessed at the time of the incident, that the delay of a second autopsy was postponed till it was impossible due to a rise in the river, and that he had no proof that the clothing used for DNA testing was even that of the girls. The CBI announced in a news conference on 27 November 2014 that after a five-month probe they have concluded that the two cousins were not sexually assaulted and murdered as police initially said, but took their own lives. According to their investigation, through the use of phone records it was established that the older girl was, in fact, having an affair with 20-year-old Pappy Yadav, with whom she had shared about 400 calls. In December 2015, the POCSO court of Badaun, in a written verdict of 25 pages, rejected CBI's closure report. Additional district judge Virendra Kumar Pandey dismissed the CBI's closure report. He further summoned for the prime accused Pappu. The CBI report has been questioned by some local villagers and All India Democratic Women's Association, affiliated with Communist Party of India (Marxist). The Aam Admi Party has claimed that it is a cover-up \\"to avoid international shame and acceptance of the dismal law and order situation\\". Protests and reactions after initial reports In a statement in response to a PIL filed by an Allahabad NGO, the Allahabad High Court said: : \\"We find that the law and order situation in the state of Uttar Pradesh has deteriorated. In the past couple of months, crimes against women have increased and this incident, unfortunately, has engaged the attention of the world at large...The administration has taken a back seat and, instead of maintaining the rule of law, a concerted effort of a blame game has taken shape by the officials manning the administration. What would be the shape of the investigation is not known. What is the state of affairs of crimes against women in UP is required to be indicated. The court is conscious of the exercise of its powers and considering the present situation, it is necessary for the court to monitor the investigation\\". On 1 June, hundreds of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the office of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow. The protesters demanded that action be taken to combat the rise in the number of rapes and other violent attacks on women and girls, and protested about the indifference of the police, which they believe encourages attacks on them. Activists and others said it appears that nothing has changed since the December 2012 fatal gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi. Police dispersed the crowd with water cannons. On 11 June, it was reported that a group of women in Ernakulam, Kerala protested the rape by appearing in public with their shoulders and legs bared. The women had wrapped themselves in tri- colour banners to represent the Indian national flag, with anti-rape messages printed on them. A spokesperson for the group said: \\"We used our bodies to protest against people who are using women's bodies as a political weapon. Without hearing our voices of protests and slogans, without understanding the apolitical climate which is permeating in the society, people are more worried about our bare shoulders and legs. To those people who still think female bodies are the reason for rape, we mock all those people, in the name of those girls who were raped and lynched in Uttar Pradesh.\\" Police arrested the women and charged them with indecent exposure. =Reactions= Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav, drew widespread criticism when he replied to a journalist's question about a sharp rise in rape cases when he replied saying: \\"It's not as if you faced any danger.\\" Following the rape and murder of the girls a recent comment made by former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Mulayam Singh Yadav, has also been frequently mentioned in the press. At an election rally Yadav had stated that he opposed the death penalty for rapists saying, \\"Boys will be boys. They make mistakes\\". On 2 June, the United Nations issued a statement condemning the gang-rape and murders saying: \\"There should be justice for families of the two teenage girls ... Violence against women is a human rights issue, not a women's issue. Violence against women is preventable, not inevitable ... The Badaun incident highlights the dangers women in India are exposed to due to lack of toilets\\". In a statement, Lise Grande, the UN's resident coordinator for India, said, \\"There should be justice for the families of the two teenage girls and for all the women and girls from lower-caste communities who are targeted and raped in rural India\\". On 4 June, Ban Ki-moon condemned the rape case and spoke against the violence against women that is spreading across the world. He also condemned the destructive attitude of \\"boys will be boys\\". The All India Democratic Women's Association condemned the incident and demanded speedy investigation into the crime as well as action against erring police personnel. Shireen Vakil Miller, of Save the Children India, called the attack \\"part of an alarming trend of brutal violence against those from marginalised communities\\". SUM ngo Chief and other members agitated against this brutal violence in Delhi. They made the pressure on Government by there efforts. Caste issues While some early reports in Hindi and a New York Times article did not identify the victims to be from the Dalit caste, they were erroneously identified as being Dalit in a Reuter's report by Nita Bhalla on 29 May. It was later widely reported based on Reuters that they were not Dalit but in fact they were of the Maurya caste, which is in fact has same status as yadav. The central government asked the Uttar Pradesh state government why the stringent clauses of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (SC/ST) were not applied when the accused were charged with raping and murdering the two girls in Badaun. The state government responded that per the report received from the Badaun district administration, the victims did not belong to SC/ST; they were from the Other Backward Class (OBC) community. Several reports acknowledge that the victims belonged to the community generally known as Shakya (also termed Maurya), while the suspects, as well as the local police officers, belong to the Yadav community. Both castes are classified as OBC in Uttar Pradesh. While the Yadavas are numerically stronger, the Shakyas also have a significant population. It was reported that this may lead to some political implications. In Popular Culture A Bollywood movie named Article 15 was made in the year 2019 based on this case.

It is part of SpaceX Draco family of rocket engines. A redundant array of eight SuperDraco engines provides fault-tolerant propulsion for use as a launch escape system for the SpaceX Dragon 2 passenger-carrying space capsule. SuperDraco rocket engines utilize a storable (non-cryogenic) hypergolic propellant which allows the engines to be fired many months after fueling and launch. They combine the functions of both a reaction control system and a main propulsive engine. The engines are used on crew transport flights to low Earth orbit, and were also projected to be used for entry, descent and landing control of the now-canceled Red Dragon to Mars. SuperDracos are used on the SpaceX Dragon 2 crew-transporting space capsule and were used on the DragonFly, a prototype low-altitude reusable rocket that was used for flight testing various aspects of the propulsive-landing technology. While the engine is capable of of thrust, during use for DragonFly testing, the engines will be throttled to to maintain vehicle stability. History On February 1, 2012 SpaceX announced that it had completed the development of a new, more powerful version of a storable-propellant rocket engine, this one called SuperDraco. This high-thrust hypergolic engine‚Äîabout 200 times more powerful than the Draco RCS thruster hypergolic engine‚Äîoffers deep throttling ability, and just like the Draco thruster, was designed to provide multiple restart capability and use the same shared hypergolic propellants as Draco. Its primary purpose was to be for SpaceX's launch abort system (LAS) on the Dragon spacecraft. According to a NASA press release, the engine has a transient from ignition to full thrust of 100 ms. During launch abort, eight SuperDracos were expected to fire for 5 seconds at full thrust. The development of the engine was partially funded by NASA's CCDev 2 program. Name: Draco comes from the Greek drak≈çn for dragon. Draco (constellation) is a constellation (the Dragon) in the polar region of the Northern Hemisphere near Cepheus and Ursa Major. Design SuperDraco engines use a storable propellant mixture of monomethylhydrazine fuel and dinitrogen tetroxide oxidizer. They are capable of being restarted many times, and have the capability to deeply reduce their thrust providing precise control during propulsive landing of the Dragon capsule. SuperDraco is the third most powerful engine developed by SpaceX. It is approximately 200 times as powerful as the Draco thruster engine. By comparison, it is more than twice as powerful as the Kestrel engine that was used in SpaceX's Falcon 1 launch vehicle second stage, about 1/9 the thrust of a Merlin 1D engine, and expected to be 1/26th as powerful as the SpaceX Raptor engine. In addition to the use of the SuperDraco thrusters for powered-landings on Earth, NASA's Ames Research Center was studying the feasibility of a Dragon-derived Mars lander for scientific investigation until 2017. Preliminary analysis in 2011 indicated that the final deceleration would be within the retro-propulsion SuperDraco thruster capabilities. SuperDraco is designed to be highly throttleable, from 100 to 20% of full thrust. This would have been used for precision controllable propulsive landings of the Dragon V2 spacecraft. Engine testing SuperDraco test-fire mosaic The SuperDraco engine development program had an extensive test program that spanned several years. , the SuperDraco ground-test engines had been fired a total of 58 times for a total firing-time duration of 117 seconds and SpaceX expressed hope that the test results would exceed the original requirements for the engine. A second version of the engine was developed in 2013, this one manufactured with 3D printing rather than the traditional casting technique. By July 2014, the 3D-printed engine combustion chamber had been fired over 80 times, for a total duration of more than 300 seconds, and it likewise completed a full qualification test. The SuperDraco completed qualification testing in May 2014 ‚Äì including testing \\"across a variety of conditions including multiple starts, extended firing durations and extreme off-nominal propellant flow and temperatures.\\" By January 2015, SpaceX demonstrated the SuperDraco engine pod with full functionality at McGregor, Texas. Four of these engine pods, each containing two SuperDraco engines, will be used in the Dragon 2 crewed spacecraft. In April 2015, SpaceX and NASA set a timeframe to test a Dragon 2's SuperDraco engines with a pad abort test. The test eventually occurred on May 6, 2015, from a test stand at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station SLC-40. and was successful. On April 20, 2019, the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule used on DM-1 was destroyed during a test of the SuperDraco engines at Landing Zone 1. Manufacturing On September 5, 2013 Elon Musk tweeted an image of a regeneratively cooled SuperDraco rocket chamber emerging from an EOS 3D metal printer, and indicated that it was composed of the Inconel superalloy.https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/375737311641628672?screen_name=elonmusk This was later shown to be the production technique for the flight-level engines. It was announced in May 2014 that the flight-qualified version of the SuperDraco engine is the first fully 3D printed rocket engine. In particular, the engine combustion chamber is printed of Inconel, an alloy of nickel and iron, using a process of direct metal laser sintering, and operates at a chamber pressure at a very high temperature. The engines are contained in a printed protective nacelle to prevent fault propagation in the event of an engine failure. The ability to 3D print the complex parts was key to achieving the low-mass objective of the engine. According to Elon Musk, \\"It‚Äôs a very complex engine, and it was very difficult to form all the cooling channels, the injector head, and the throttling mechanism. Being able to print very high strength advanced alloys ... was crucial to being able to create the SuperDraco engine as it is.\\" The 3D printing process for the SuperDraco engine dramatically reduces lead-time compared to the traditional cast parts, and \\"has superior strength, ductility, and fracture resistance, with a lower variability in materials properties.\\" According to Elon Musk, cost reduction through 3D printing is also significant, in particular because SpaceX can print an hourglass chamber where the entire wall consists of internal cooling channels, which would be impossible without additive manufacturing.

It describes the consolidation of wealth in the United States, and the dismantling of the middle class. As a result, the American Dream‚Äîa national ethos, or a set of ideals in which freedom includes the opportunity for prosperity and success, and an upward social mobility achieved through hard work‚Äîis becoming increasingly unattainable. Although Smith's distinguished journalistic career includes covering the Vietnam War, the Pentagon Papers, and the civil rights movement, serving as the Moscow Bureau Chief for the New York Times, writing a #1 bestseller, and working on 26 prime-time specials for PBS, he views this book as \\"'absolutely' his most significant achievement.\\"  Summary and reception  A positive review in USA Today summarized the book as follows: > Smith shows how corporate chieftains in cahoots with their stockholders > rather than their employees sold out those employees ‚Äî sold them out with > the blessing of U.S. senators, U.S. representatives, U.S. presidents, > presidential appointees at executive branch agencies and a bare majority of > U.S. Supreme Court Justices validating the decisions of mostly Republican- > appointed lower court judges. Smith suggests that The Powell Memorandum, a widely circulated memo written by Lewis F. Powell, Jr. was instrumental in setting this new political direction for US business leaders. The result was the development of \\"wedge economics\\" in the 1980s, in which CEOs no longer balanced the needs of all stakeholders‚Äîworkers, customers, and investors‚Äîbut rather maximized profits of investors and executives only.

It was distributed by Universal Pictures and Vertigo Films and produced by Revolver Entertainment. The film is based on The Stone Roses' seminal gig on Spike Island in Widnes, Cheshire, England, and follows the story of a group of friends who idolize the band and try to get into the gig, but are faced with problems because they do not have a ticket or a way to get there. Spike Island was premiered on 11 October 2012 at the BFI London Film Festival and was released on DVD on 21 June 2013. Plot Set in May 1990, the film follows the exploits of five lads: Gary 'Tits' Titchfield, Darren 'Dodge' Hodge, Chris 'Zippy' Weeks, 'Little Gaz' Gareth Barrett and 'Penfold' Andrew Peach. They are fans of The Stone Roses and members of wannabe band Shadowcaster. It starts 60 hours prior to The Stone Roses' legendary gig at Spike Island, Widnes, Cheshire. The group get an idea to give The Stone Roses their cassette tape via Sally, a girl whom both Tits and Dodge show interest in, although Dodge has never spoken to her. They hatch a plan to get tickets to the gig and kick-start their career. Tits' brother 'Ibiza' Steve gets the boys on the guest-list for the gig. But when Tits' dad gets increasingly ill during the 60 hours, he fails to turn up and on the morning of the gig his dad worsens but his dad tells Tits to go to the gig. Penfold's dad burns his top in an effort to stop him from going and when he goes to hit him Penfold stands up to his dad after his dad has been abusing him and heads to the gig. They lure 'Uncle Hairy' out of his van and steal it but when they run out of fuel they have to stop but Penfold convinces them to walk to the M6. They hide in the baggage hold of the bus until they arrive at Spike Island. Once arrived they jump out of their hiding place and are chased by police and the bus driver but lose them in the crowd. They lose Penfold and are unable to find him, so they carry on to the entry zone. But are turned away because they do not have tickets and are not on the guest-list. The remaining four make their way to the outside of the venue. They meet Sally who has lost her friends in the crowd and doesn't want to go in alone and gives Dodge her ticket. Dodge heads for the gig without the cassette tape because he was afraid \\"to fuck it up\\". On his way back to the boys, he sees Sally and Tits hooking up. Tits and Dodge later argue but when Tits' dad eventually dies they make up. Meanwhile, Zippy visits the nearby Catalyst Science Discovery Centre (at that point still called The Museum of the Chemical Industry). At the end of the movie it is shown that Tits and Sally are together and all the boys have moved on as school has finished. The ending scene shows Tits looking at Dodge from his window while Dodge walks down the lane with his guitar and bags.

The film stars Helen Mirren, Ryan Reynolds, Daniel Br√ºhl, Katie Holmes, Tatiana Maslany, Max Irons, Charles Dance, Elizabeth McGovern, and Jonathan Pryce. The film is based on the true story of Maria Altmann, an elderly Jewish refugee living in Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles, who, together with her young lawyer, Randy Schoenberg, fought the government of Austria for almost a decade to reclaim Gustav Klimt's iconic painting of her aunt, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I, which was stolen from her relatives by the Nazis in Vienna just prior to World War II. Altmann took her legal battle all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled on the case Republic of Austria v. Altmann (2004). The film was screened in the Berlinale Special Galas section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival on 9 February 2015, and was released in the United Kingdom on 10 April 2015 and in the United States on 1 April. Plot The actual Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I In a series of flashbacks, Maria Altmann recalls Anschluss, the arrival of Nazi forces in Vienna, the persecution of the Jewish community and the looting and pillaging by the Nazis against Jewish families. Maria Altmann and members of her family attempt to flee to the United States. While Altmann and her husband are successful, she is forced to abandon her parents in Vienna. In the present, living in Los Angeles, an elderly and widowed Altmann attends the funeral for her sister. She discovers letters in her sister's possession dating to the late 1940s, which reveal an attempt to recover artwork owned by the Bloch-Bauer family that was left behind during the family's flight for freedom and stolen by the Nazis. Of particular note is a painting of Altmann's aunt, Adele Bloch-Bauer, now known in Austria as the \\"Woman in Gold\\". Altmann enlists the help of E. Randol Schoenberg (the son of her close friend, Barbara), a lawyer with little experience, to make a claim to the art restitution board in Austria. Reluctantly returning to her homeland, Altmann discovers that the country's minister and art director are unwilling to part with the painting, which they feel has become part of the national identity. Altmann is told that the painting was legitimately bequeathed to the gallery by her aunt. Upon further investigation by her lawyer and Austrian journalist Hubertus Czernin, this claim proves to be wrong as the alleged will is invalid due to the fact that her aunt did not own the painting, the artist's fee having been paid by Altmann's uncle. Adele Bloch- Bauer wanted the painting to go to the museum at her husband's death but it was taken from him by the Nazis and placed in the museum by a Nazi- collaborating curator, well before his death. Schoenberg files a challenge with the art restitution board but it is denied and Altmann does not have the money needed to challenge the ruling. Defeated, she and Schoenberg return to the United States. Months later, happening upon an art book with \\"Woman in Gold\\" on the cover, Schoenberg has an epiphany. Using a narrow rule of law and precedents in which an art restitution law was retrospectively applied, Schoenberg files a claim in US court against the Austrian government contesting their claim to the painting. An appeal goes to the Supreme Court of the United States, where in the matter of Republic of Austria v. Altmann, the court rules in Altmann's favor, which results in the Austrian government attempting to persuade Altmann to retain the painting for the gallery, which she refuses. After a falling out over the issue of returning to Austria for a second time to argue the case, Altmann agrees for Schoenberg to go and argue the case in front of a panel of three arbiters in Vienna. In Austria, the panel hears the case, during which Schoenberg reminds them of the Nazi regime's crimes. He implores the arbitration panel to think of the meaning of the word \\"restitution\\" and to look past the artwork hanging in art galleries to see the injustice to the families who once owned such great paintings and were forcibly separated from them by the Nazis. Unexpectedly, Altmann arrives during the session, indicating to Czernin that she came to support her lawyer. After considering both sides of the dispute, the arbitration panel rules in favour of Altmann, returning her paintings. The Austrian government representative makes a last-minute proposal begging Altmann to keep the paintings in the Belvedere against a generous compensation. Altmann refuses and elects to have the painting moved to the United States with her (\\"They will now travel to America like I once had to as well\\") and takes up an offer made earlier by Ronald Lauder to acquire them for his New York gallery to display the painting on condition that it be a permanent exhibit.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. =Accolades= Helen Mirren received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. Historical accuracy Altmann's efforts actually addressed five Klimt paintings owned by her family, including Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I and Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II, as well as three landscapes. The decisions by the US Supreme Court and the Austrian arbitrators covered all five paintings. Film critics in Austria and Germany noted various deviations of the film from historical reality. Olga Kronsteiner from the Austrian daily Der Standard wrote that it was not Maria Altmann's lawyer, Randol Sch√∂nberg, who researched and initiated the restitution case, but Austrian journalist Hubertus Czernin, who had worked on a number of restitution files at the time, who found the decisive documents and subsequently informed Maria Altmann. Hubertus Czernin, who is depicted in the movie, is suggested to have been motivated by the fact that his father had been a member of the Nazi Party; but Stefan Grissemann from Austrian weekly Profil pointed out that his father's party membership was not known to Czernin until 2006, long after he had started to work on this and other restitution cases; and that in addition Czernin's father was imprisoned by the Nazis late in the war for high treason. Thomas Trenkler from the Viennese daily Kurier criticized the film's reference to a time limit for restitution claims in Austria, writing that there has never been such a time limit. He also wrote that his least favorite scene in the film was when Maria Altmann leaves her ailing father in Vienna in 1938. Despite the imminent danger, Maria Altmann stayed in Vienna, having said, \\"I would never have left my father! He died of natural causes in July 1938\\". Only then did she and her husband escape from Vienna. In June 2006, based on an earlier agreement between Altmann and Ronald Lauder (which was shown in the film), Altmann sold Portrait of Adele Bloch- Bauer I to Lauder's Neue Galerie New York for $135 million ($ million today), setting a new mark for most expensive painting (since surpassed). Five months later, Altmann sold the companion Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II at auction (bought by Oprah Winfrey) for almost $88 million ($ million today), then the third-highest priced painting. Gustav Bloch-Bauer had been loaned the famous \\"Gore Booth Baron Rothschild\\" Stradivarius cello (see List of Stradivarius instruments) by the Rothschild family, which was looted by the Nazis in 1938 and retained by the German authorities till 1956.

Over the next few years he was a co-ordinating coach for South Melbourne and served on the committee, before returning to the Under 19s for another season in 1966. In November that year he was named as the new senior coach of South Melbourne, to replace Bob Skilton, who had stepped down from the position, but remained with the side as a player. Described as a \\"strict disciplinarian and a good tactician\\", Miller had a good start to his VFL coaching career, with South Melbourne securing three wins in the opening four rounds of the 1967 season. (the date of birth given is that of footballer Allan Miller) In round eight, South Melbourne defeated reigning premiers St Kilda by 29 points at Lake Oval, but they won only one more game for the rest of the season and finished in ninth position. South Melbourne were also ninth- place finishers in the 1968 VFL season, with six wins. He resigned on 1 October 1968, citing the increasing demands on his time, as he also worked as an executive officer at the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. In 1967 he had suffered nervous exhaustion during South Melbourne's round 13 loss to Fitzroy and coaching was transferred to assistant coach Ken Boyd for the remainder of that game. Miller died on 9 September 2000, at The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne.

Leading directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, James Cameron, Woody Allen, Terry Gilliam, the Coen Brothers, Ridley Scott, Paul Thomas Anderson, Christopher Nolan, David Lynch, Trey Parker and Matt Stone,http://www.southparkwillie.com/SPMedia/Scanned/40questions.pdf and George A. Romero, have cited Kubrick as a source of inspiration, and in the case of Spielberg, collaboration.See Harlan 2001 for interviews with Scorsese and Spielberg.See Greenwald 2007 for an interview with Scott. In an interview for the Eyes Wide Shut DVD release, Steven Spielberg comments that \\"nobody could shoot a picture better in history\\", and that Kubrick told stories in a way \\"antithetical to the way we are accustomed to receiving stories\\". Writing in the introduction to a recent edition of Michel Ciment's Kubrick, film director Martin Scorsese notes most of Kubrick's films were misunderstood and under-appreciated when first released, only to be considered masterpieces later on. Orson Welles, one of Kubrick's strongest personal influences, famously said: \\"Among those whom I would call 'younger generation', Kubrick appears to me to be a giant.\\" The directors Akira Kurosawa, Richard Linklater, Sam Mendes, Quentin Tarantino,Lucas (no date). Online at: 7 Classic Movies that Influenced Quentin Tarantino: Horror, Suspense, Film Noir ‚Äì and Plenty of Laughs Joel Schumacher, Taylor Hackford, and Darren Aronofsky have all mentioned Kubrick as having made one of their favorite films. Influence Kubrick continues to be cited as important to the artistic careers of several later directors, including David Fincher, Guillermo del Toro, David Lynch, Lars von Trier, Michael Mann, and Gaspar No√©. Many filmmakers imitate Kubrick's inventive and unique use of camera movement and framing. For example, several of Jonathan Glazer's music videos contain visual references to Kubrick. The Coen Brothers' Barton Fink, in which the hotel itself seems malevolent, contains a hotel hallway Steadicam shot as an homage to The Shining. The storytelling style of their Hudsucker Proxy was influenced by Dr. Strangelove. Director Tim Burton has included a few visual homages to Kubrick in his work, notably using actual footage from 2001: A Space Odyssey in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and modeling the look of Tweedledee and Tweedledum in his version of Alice in Wonderland on the Grady girls in The Shining. Director Tim Burton erroneously refers to the Grady girls as twins. Film critic Roger Ebert also noted that Burton's Mars Attacks! was partially inspired by Dr. Strangelove. The video for The Killers' song \\"Bones\\" that Burton directed includes clips from Kubrick's Lolita, as well as other films from the general era. Kubrick's influence on Todd Field was perhaps the most direct. After acting in Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, Field immediately went on to make In the Bedroom. William Arnold, in reviewing the film, wrote: In January 2002 Field cited Kubrick as an important inspiration: Use of music Paul Thomas Anderson (who was fond of Kubrick as a teenager) in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, stated \\"it's so hard to do anything that doesn't owe some kind of debt to what Stanley Kubrick did with music in movies. Inevitably, you're going to end up doing something that he's probably already done before. It can all seem like we're falling behind whatever he came up with.\\" Reviewer William Arnold described Anderson's There Will Be Blood as a stylistic homage to Kubrick, \\"particularly 2001: A Space Odyssey‚Äì opening with a similar prologue that jumps in stages over the years and using a soundtrack throughout that employs anachronistic music.\\" Although Michael Moore specializes in documentary filmmaking, at the beginning of shooting his only non-documentary feature film Canadian Bacon, he sat his cast and crew down to watch Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. He told them, \\"What this movie was in the '60s, is what we should aspire to with this film.\\" Moore had previously written Kubrick a letter telling him how much Bacon was inspired by Strangelove. Film director Frank Darabont has been inspired by Kubrick's use of music. In an interview with The Telegraph, he states that 2001 took \\"the use of music in film\\" to absolute perfection, and one shot employing classical music in The Shawshank Redemption follows Kubrick's lead. On the other hand, while Darabont has followed Kubrick in directing two Stephen King adaptations, Darabont shares Stephen King's negative view of Kubrick's adaption of The Shining and claims that 2001 is his greatest film.; Darabont also echoes these criticisms Critics occasionally detect a Kubrickian influence when the filmmaker acknowledges none. Critics have noticed the influence of Stanley Kubrick on Danish independent director Nicolas Winding Refn. Jim Pappas suggests this comes from Refn's employment of Kubrick's cinematographer for Eyes Wide Shut in his film Fear X, suggesting \\"it is the Kubrick influence that leaves us asking ourselves what we believe we should know is true\\". The apparent influence of Kubrick on his film Bronson was noted by the Los Angeles Times and the French publication Evene When asked by Twitch about the very frequent comparisons by critics of the film Bronson to A Clockwork Orange, Refn denied the influence. Refn stated Kubrick's direction has impacted the field of rock music as well. American rock group the Byrds were inspired to cover Vera Lynn's \\"We'll Meet Again\\" for their album Mr. Tambourine Man after hearing the song's use in Dr. Strangelove. Homages In 2000 BAFTA renamed their Britannia lifetime achievement award the \\"Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award\\". Kubrick is among filmmakers such as D. W. Griffith, Laurence Olivier, Cecil B. DeMille, and Irving Thalberg, all of whom have had annual awards named after them. Kubrick won this award in 1999, and subsequent recipients have included George Lucas, Warren Beatty, Tom Cruise, Robert De Niro, Clint Eastwood, and Daniel Day-Lewis.\\"Daniel Day-Lewis to Receive Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award\\", Irish Film and Television Network, October 5, 2012 Entrance to Kubrick museum exhibit at LACMA A number of people who worked with Kubrick on his films created the 2001 documentary Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures, produced and directed by Kubrick's brother-in-law, Jan Harlan, who had executive produced Kubrick's last four films. The film's chapters each cover one of Kubrick's films, and Kubrick's childhood is explored in the introductory section. On October 30, 2012, an exhibition devoted to Kubrick opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and concluded in June 2013. The exhibition, curated by Deutsches Filminstitut and Deutsches Architekturmuseum, was previously displayed in Frankfurt am Main, Germany (2004); Berlin, Germany (2005); Melbourne, Australia (2006); Ghent, Belgium, and Zurich, Switzerland (both in 2007); Rome, Italy (2008); Paris, France (2011); and Amsterdam, Netherlands (2012). Exhibits include a wide collection of documents, photographs and on-set material assembled from 800 boxes of personal archives that were stored in Kubrick's home-workplace in the U.K. A number of celebrities attended and spoke at the museum's pre-opening gala, including Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and Jack Nicholson, while Kubrick's widow, Christiane, appeared at the pre-gala press review. On November 7, 2012, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, in conjunction with the LACMA exhibition, celebrated Kubrick's life and career. Malcolm McDowell hosted, and along with other actors, including Paul Mazursky, Ryan O'Neal and Matthew Modine, discussed personal experiences of working with Kubrick. In October 2013, the Brazil S√£o Paulo International Film Festival paid tribute to Kubrick, staging an exhibit of his work and a retrospective of his films.\\"S√£o Paulo Film Festival Opens With Stanley Kubrick Exhibit\\", Hollywood Reporter, Oct. 18, 2013 The exhibit was also scheduled to open at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in late 2014.\\"Stanley Kubrick exhibition opening in Brazil, heading to Toronto\\", Los Angeles Times, Oct. 9, 2013 In popular culture The TV series The Simpsons is said to contain more references to Kubrick films than any other pop culture phenomenon. References abound to many of his films, including 2001, A Clockwork Orange, and The Shining.Westfahl 2005, p. 1232. When the Directors Guild of Great Britain gave Kubrick a lifetime achievement award, they included a cut-together sequence of all the homages from the show. In 2009, an exhibition of paintings and photos inspired by Kubrick's films was held in Dublin, Ireland, entitled 'Stanley Kubrick: Taming Light'. The Sunday Tribune shut down its website in early 2011, and the website of this article appears to have been not archived by the Wayback Machine. The text of the article has been reproduced (without the painting reproductions) at a website for the exhibit In 2010, painter (and film storyboard artist) Carlos Ramos held an exhibition entitled \\"Kubrick\\" in Los Angeles, featuring paintings in a variety of styles based on scenes from Stanley Kubrick films. Among her multiple allusions to Kubrick in song and video, pop singer Lady Gaga's video for \\"Bad Romance\\" appeared to pay homage to Kubrick,Daniel Kreps (November 10, 2009). \\"Lady Gaga Premieres 'Bad Romance', Her Craziest Video Yet\\".

He was also mentioned in her song \\"Dance in the Dark\\", alongside other famous people who died tragically, like Jesus and JonBenet Ramsey. The Jim Carrey comedy Fun with Dick and Jane refers several times to an all-important \\"CRM-114\\" form. CRM 114, or variations, is an \\"easter egg\\" in several Kubrick films, such as Dr. Strangelove. Both heavy metal bands, Slipknot and Mudvayne paid homage to The Shining; the former with the music video of their song, \\"Spit it Out\\", directed by Thomas Mignone, where it consists of conceptual imagery of the bandmates each portraying characters enacting iconic scenes from the film, with Joey Jordison as Danny Torrance; Shawn Crahan and Chris Fehn as the Grady twins; Corey Taylor as Jack Torrance; Mick Thomson as Lloyd the Bartender; Craig Jones as Dick Hallorann; James Root as Wendy Torrance; Paul Gray as Harry Derwent; and Sid Wilson as the corpse in the bathtub. The video was banned from MTV for overtly graphic and violent depictions, including Corey Taylor's smashing through a door with an axe and the scene wherein James Root viciously assaults Corey Taylor with a baseball bat. Mignone and the band eventually re-edited a less violent version, which was subsequently aired on MTV.Dirty Horror Spotlight: Slipknot Dirty Horror Posted January 30, 201310 Great Pop Culture Homages To The Shining Flavorwire - Posted Sept 30, 2011 Mudvayne's song, \\"Dull Boy\\" is a tribute to the film quoting the line, \\"all work and no play makes me a dull boy.\\" American metalcore band Ice Nine Kills released a song celebrating the 37th anniversary of The Shining, entitled \\"Enjoy Your Slay\\". The song is based on the film adaptation of The Shining and features Kubrick's grandson, Sam, as a guest vocalist. Films about elements of Kubrick's life In the early 1990s, a con artist named Alan Conway frequented the London entertainment scene claiming to be Stanley Kubrick, and temporarily deceived New York Times theatre critic Frank Rich, as well as multiple aspiring actors. Kubrick's personal assistant, Anthony Frewin, who helped track Conway down, wrote the screenplay for a film based on the Conway affair Colour Me Kubrick, starring John Malkovich as Alan Conway. Kubrick's widow, Christiane Kubrick, was also a consultant for the film. The film contains several tongue-in-cheek homages to scenes from Kubrick's films. Conway was earlier the subject of the short documentary film The Man Who Would be Kubrick. Kubrick was portrayed on film by actor Stanley Tucci in the film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers. Although Sellers acted in two of Kubrick's films, the material here is almost wholly focused on their work together in Dr. Strangelove. In 2012, the documentary film Room 237 was released, which speculates about overt and hidden meanings behind The Shining. The film includes footage from that and other Kubrick films, along with discussions by a number of Kubrick experts. The film includes nine segments, with each segment focusing on different elements within the film which \\"may reveal hidden clues and hint at a bigger thematic oeuvre.\\"\\"Room 237 Sundance 2012 Review\\", January 27, 2012 In 2017, Filmworker was released, which was a documentary about Leon Vitali, an actor first cast in Kubrick's Barry Lyndon. Vitali would become a friend and frequent collaborator to the director on his subsequent films as his assistant. The film explores his friendship and working relationship with Kubrick.

Built about 1856, it is a stylistically distinctive vernacular mixing of Federal, Greek Revival, and Italianate styling. It is the most architecturally distinctive of Weare's surviving 19th- century schoolhouses. It was used as a public school until 1952, and then served as a grange hall until the 1980s. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description and history The North Weare Schoolhouse is located on Old Concord Stage Road (New Hampshire Route 77), a short way east of its junction with New Hampshire Route 114. It is set back from the road, with a circular drive in front that is fringed by mature trees. The building is a 1¬Ω-story brick structure with a gabled roof topped by a square belfry with round-arch louvered openings. The front facade is three bays wide, with entrances recessed in a round-arch opening framed by cast-iron columns. In the gable above there are two sash windows topped by blind rounded fans. The bays on the building sides, and its corners, are articulated by brick pilasters. The school was built in 1856 to serve the town's 16th school district. It is architecturally the must unusual of the town's 19th-century district schools, and is the only one to be built in brick. It continued in this use until 1952, and was one of the last four district schools to be closed in the town. From 1960 to 1985 it housed the local chapter of the Grange.

It involved taking people by force to do work ranging from half-a-day cleaning of rubble to deportation to the gulag, from which one could never return. After a few days of waiting and then a month-long trip, the group finally arrived at their destination: camp number 7144/1223 in Voroshilovka, Uspenskij rayon, Voroshilovgrad Oblast, in the Donetsk coal basin.

There is also a Cape-style house built using the relatively rare vertical-plank method of framing, and there are several surviving 19th-century barns. The district covers along all or part of Old County Road South, Pratt (Clark) Road, and Birdsall Road. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Old County Road South was among the first areas to be settled in Francestown. It was home to Moses Bradford, the town's first Congregationalist pastor, and William Starrett, a leading force in both the church and the local government. The Bradford House (c. 1790) is a particularly fine example of Georgian architecture, while Starrett's house (1806) is one of the town's first brick houses, and is set on farmland with fine views. Three members of the Dodge family, including Simon, another of the town's early settlers, built houses in the district, and were prominent in the town economy, operating a local mill. The mill stood in the area, but now only foundational and archaeological evidence of it remain.

She is known for her depictions of First Nations and Inuit people of the north of Canada. Life Kathleen Frances Daly was born in Napanee, Ontario, on 28 May 1898. She came from an prosperous family. Her parents were Denis Daly and Mary (Bennett) Daly. She attended Havergal College, Toronto, a girls boarding school. She was admitted to the University of Toronto in 1920. She studied at the Ontario College of Art, Toronto (1920‚Äì24), where her instructors included John William Beatty, George Agnew Reid, Arthur Lismer and J. E. H. MacDonald. She went to the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re, Paris (1924‚Äì25), took private lessons in wood engraving from Ren√© Pottier in Paris, and studied at the Parsons School of Design, New York (1926). Between 1924 and 1930 she made a sketching trip to Europe each year. She visited the Basque Country, Italy and France. Butchering the swine, Saint- Urbain, Charlevoix county, in the 1930s, photograph by Katherine Daly Pepper Kathleen Daly met George Pepper (1903‚Äì1962) while they were both studying at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re in Paris. They married in 1929 and moved to Canada. At first they were based in Ottawa, Ontario. The Peppers traveled to the north shore of Lake Superior, then to Charlevoix County in the Laurentian Mountains of Quebec in 1930. In 1931 they visited Nova Scotia and the Gasp√©, and in 1932 returned to Quebec. In 1932 George Pepper was made a member of the staff of the Ontario College of Art, and the Peppers moved to Toronto. In 1933 they built a log studio in Charlevoix County, where Kathleen Daly painted French-Canadian genre scenes and landscapes. Their cabin was in the village of Saint-Urbain, where they were great friends of Alphonse and Madame l'Abb√©, an extremely outgoing and hospitable family. Other artists would come to stay at the l'Abb√© farmhouse. The Peppers lived and worked at the Studio Building in Toronto from 1934 to 1951. They continued to travel widely in Canada, visiting the east and west coast and going as far north as Ellesmere Island. Kathleen painted portraits of Montagnais Indians of the Lac St. Jean district (Mashteuiatsh reserve) in 1936. In 1938-39 she painted the Quebec landscape and the habitants. In 1952 Daly visited Mexico, and later traveled in Spain and Morocco. In 1954 the Peppers spent ten days on a trawler on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, sketching the fishermen. In 1960 they traveled on the Canadian government steamer C.D. Howe to the Eastern Arctic on the three-month voyage. They drew and painted the Inuit and ice formations, and prepared reports on Inuit art to the Department of Northern Affairs. In 1961 they spent seven weeks in an Inuit home, and depicted the Inuit of Puvirnituq and the District of Ungava. Her images from this period appeared in the government's North magazine. George Pepper died in 1962. Kathleen Daly continued to travel and paint in Quebec and other regions. Kathleen Daly died in Toronto on 21 August 1994, aged 96. Work Kathleen Daly's work has strong line and rhythm, and has been associated with the Group of Seven. The Peppers were good friends of A. Y. Jackson, who also lived in the Studio Building, and who had a marked influence on their landscape styles. As with members of the Group, her work had a strong element of design and used bold patterns. In her choice of subjects, including the native people of Canada, fishermen and miners, she went beyond the Group. Her work in Quebec goes beyond conventional picturesque subjects and reflects an interest in the social and economic conditions of the country people. Some of her paintings of native people also show concern about social issues. Her pictures of Inuit mothers nurturing their children show them as sources of strength, independence and the preservation of their language and culture. Daly made some of the illustrations for Kingdom of the Saguenay (1936) by Marius Barbeau. In 1966 Daly published a book about James Wilson Morrice. Daly was a prolific artist. In 1975 Daly was asked by the National Gallery of Canada to provide an update to her biographical data. An eleven-page appendix gave a chronology of her painting expeditions and listed her exhibits and commissions, books and articles she had written, reviews and reproductions of her work and works held in public collections. She left a bequest of more than forty works by herself and George Pepper to the University of Lethbridge. Over five hundred paintings by Daly and her husband were left to the Centre d‚Äôart Baie-Saint-Paul. Works held at the National Gallery of Canada include: *Sous- le-Cap, Quebec, 1928. etching and drypoint on wove paper. 44.8 x 32.3 cm; plate: 35.2 x 24.7 cm *Mackerel, 1931. oil on canvas. 73.8 x 84 cm *Ren√©, 1935. oil on canvas. 92 x 79.1 cm *L'escalier canadien, c. 1939. oil on canvas. 107 x 92.1 cm Her works are also held in the collections of the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton and the Roberts Gallery in Toronto. Many of her drawings and paintings were also sold to private collectors. Exhibitions and memberships Between 1930 and 1956 Daly's work was shown in all the main exhibitions in Canada, and also in London, England. Kathleen Daly exhibited at Hart House (1935), the British Empire Exhibition (1936), in the exhibition \\"A Century of Canadian Art\\" (1938) and at the Tate in London (1938). She often exhibited with the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts and the Ontario Society of Artists. Often she and her husband exhibited together. In 1999 a retrospective of their work was shown at the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. Daly joined the Canadian Group of Painters in 1934 and the Ontario Society of Artists in 1936. She became an Associate of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1937 and an Academician in 1961. She was an executive member of Toronto's Heliconian Club. Signature Her work is known under her birth name, with Kay or K.

As such it is closely related to the concept of metamodeling with applications in all areas of mathematical modelling.  Overview  Many modern mathematical models of real-life processes pose challenges when used in numerical simulations, due to complexity and large size (dimension). Model order reduction aims to lower the computational complexity of such problems, for example, in simulations of large-scale dynamical systems and control systems. By a reduction of the model's associated state space dimension or degrees of freedom, an approximation to the original model is computed which is commonly referred to as a reduced order model. Reduced order models are useful in settings where it is often unfeasible to perform numerical simulations using the complete full order model. This can be due to limitations in computational resources or the requirements of the simulations setting, for instance real-time simulation settings or many-query settings in which a large number of simulations needs to be performed. Examples of Real-time simulation settings include control systems in electronics and visualization of model results while examples for a many-query setting can include optimization problems and design exploration. In order to be applicable to real-world problems, often the requirements of a reduced order model are: * A small approximation error compared to the full order model. * Conservation of the properties and characteristics of the full order model (E.g. stability and passivity in electronics). * Computationally efficient and robust reduced order modelling techniques.  Methods  Contemporary model order reduction techniques can be broadly classified into 4 classes: * Proper orthogonal decomposition methods. * Reduced basis methods. * Balancing methods * simplified physics or operational based reduction methods. The simplified physics approach can be described to be analogous to the traditional Mathematical modelling approach, in which a less complex description of a system is constructed based on assumptions and simplifications using physical insight or otherwise derived information. However, this approach is not often the topic of discussion in the context of model order reduction as it is a general method in science, engineering, and mathematics. The remaining listed methods fall into the category of projection-based reduction. Projection-based reduction relies on the projection of either the model equations or the solution onto a basis of reduced dimensionality compared to the original solution space. Methods that also fall into this class but are perhaps less common are: * Proper generalized decomposition * Matrix interpolation * Transfer function interpolation * Piecewise tangential interpolation * Loewner framework * (Empirical) cross Gramian * Krylov subspace methods  Applications  Model order reduction finds application within all fields involving mathematical modelling and many reviews exist for the topics of electronics, fluid- and structural mechanics. =Fluid mechanics= Current Problems in fluid mechanics involve large dynamical systems representing many effects on many different scales. Computational fluid dynamics studies often involve models solving the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations with a number of degrees of freedom in the order of magnitude upwards of 10^6. The first usage of model order reduction techniques dates back to the work of Lumley in 1967 where it was used to gain insight into the mechanisms and intensity of turbulence and large coherent structures present in fluid flow problems. Model order reduction also finds modern applications in Aeronautics to model the flow over the body of aircraft. An example can be found in Lieu et al in which the full order model of an F16 fighter-aircraft with over 2.1 million degrees of freedom, was reduced to a model of just 90 degrees of freedom. Additionally reduced order modeling has been applied to study rheology in Hemodynamics and the Fluid‚Äìstructure interaction between the blood flowing through the vascular system and the vascular walls.

He designed a number of improved agricultural machines and implements, and actively promoted more efficient farming techniques. His experiments and publications were widely discussed during his lifetime and continued to attract attention in the years following his death.  Biography  Amos was born around 1745 though his geographical origins are unknown. One nineteenth-century source claimed that he was Scottish by birth but no confirmation of this has been found.The Biographical Dictionary of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge vol. ii, part ii, p. 25. Longman, Brown, Green and Longmans, 1843. According to his own brief remarks, he was raised in the countryside and was 'strongly attached to rural pursuits' from an early age.Amos, William (1794). The Theory and Practice of the Drill Husbandry, p. vi. The earliest record of him is of his marriage in Grove, Nottinghamshire on 25 February 1781 to Sarah Freeman, the daughter of a Nottinghamshire farmer.Bishop's Transcripts of Marriages for Grove Parish, Nottinghamshire, 1601‚Äì1836. He was employed at this time as estate steward to Anthony Eyre, owner of several estates in the English Midlands. Over the years that followed Amos and Sarah were to have five sons and three daughters, many of whom died at an early age: only his second son (Thomas Amos, who became a farmer in the Spalding area of Lincolnshire) is known to have had issue. Amos‚Äôs interest in new agricultural practices led him to undertake a series of crop trials from 1783 onwards, and these convinced him of the superiority of seed-drilling over the traditional broadcast method of sowing. As early as 1787 he was developing his own version of a drill-plough and he announced plans in that year for a book describing it;Bath Chronicle, 27 September 1787 (Issue 1400), p. 2. but his employer‚Äôs death in 1788 and his subsequent move to Brothertoft in Lincolnshire as bailiff to Major John Cartwright (political reformer) delayed this project. While acting as bailiff and later as estate steward to Cartwright, Amos conducted further trials on his own farm as well as Cartwright's. Cartwright combined an active political career with a keen interest in agricultural improvement, and the collaboration between the two men over a period of fifteen years or so proved beneficial to both. It also brought Amos into contact with their close neighbour Sir Joseph Banks, who later described Amos as 'an honest man and an ingenious one',Annotation in Banks's hand on letter from Amos to Banks dated 28 January 1797, held by Yale University Library (unreferenced) and with the agriculturist Arthur Young, who visited Cartwright's farm, saw some of Amos's inventions and remained in correspondence with him, obtaining a number of submissions from Amos for publication in his Annals of Agriculture.Young, Arthur (1813). General View of the Agriculture of Lincolnshire, 2nd edn, pp. 76‚Äì77. London. Facsimile reprint by Augustus M Kelley, New York, 1970Young, Arthur (ed.), Annals of Agriculture, vols 33 (1798), 35 (1800), 40 (1803) and 45 (1808). It was during this period of his life that Amos published his two books, The Theory and Practice of the Drill Husbandry and Minutes in Agriculture. When Cartwright sold his estate in the mid-1800s Amos moved to take up a tenancy of his own on the recently drained Lincolnshire West Fen, residing first in Stickney and subsequently in the newly established township of Carrington, where he ran a predominantly arable farm. A series of family bereavements (including in late 1816 his wife Sarah) combined with the agricultural recession that followed the end of the Napoleonic Wars brought about a marked decline in his fortunes. He appears never to have tried to patent any of his inventions and it seems unlikely that he earned much if anything from his published works. There is some indication from his final work (see below) that he may also have lost money when several Boston banks collapsed during 1814 and 1815. His final published work was something of a departure from his usual topics: a polemical pamphlet that appeared in 1816 (A Dissertation on the Real Cause and Effectual Cure of the Present National Distress) in which he strongly criticised the political establishment of his day and set out his proposals for reforms to the public finances and the banking system. The Dissertation is, however, above all a plea for proper recognition of working farmers, the ‚Äòmiserable drudges of agriculture‚Äô who (Amos asserts) are ‚Äòthe very basis of national prosperity‚Äô, in contrast to what he saw as the vested interest of the landowning class.Amos, William (1816). A Dissertation on the Real Cause and Effectual Cure of the Present National Distress, p. 25. Printed in Boston, Lincolnshire. In 1821, at the age of 75 and close to retirement, Amos married a 22-year-old widow (Elizabeth Scargal n√©e Dowse). They had a son and a daughter, both of whom died as children. Amos died at his home in Boston on 8 April 1825 and was buried at Stickney Parish Church in Lincolnshire.  Work  Amos‚Äôs best-known work, The Theory and Practice of the Drill Husbandry, was first published in August 1794 and was reissued in March 1802. The book begins by providing evidence from his own crop trials in favour of the seed drill, claiming yield increases of up to 20% over the traditional method of broadcast sowing. The book then gives detailed instructions, accompanied by illustrations, for the construction of Amos's own drill machines (in two versions), a drill plough and two other devices (an expanding horse-hoe and scuffle). He had previously (in 1788) sought and failed to obtain a commendation for his drill from the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts,PR/GE/112/12/29, pp. 66‚Äì67 in the Archives of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of the Arts (now the Royal Society of Arts). and in a much- disputed claim accused one of the Society's members, James Cooke, of having stolen his design.Theory and Practice etc, pp. 124‚Äì125. It is known from Arthur Young's comments that not only Major Cartwright but at least one other Lincolnshire farmer used Amos's design, but it is unclear how many others adopted it. The expanding horse-hoe had moveable shares that, unlike its main rivals, could be adjusted to suit the differing distances at which seed had been drilled. Amos's cheap and practicable drill plough was adopted by Arthur Young who in turn commended it to the Board of Agriculture and several others.Amos, William, \\"Description of a Bean Drill\\", Annals of Agriculture (ed. Arthur Young), vol. 35 (1800), p.22. Amos's second book, Minutes in Agriculture, appeared in August 1804 (with a reissue in June 1810). His stated intention was to settle the issue of which varieties of grass were most suitable for graziers to use, and his book contained advice on this accompanied by illustrations and dried grass specimens. The more theoretical botanical sections of the work were derivative and on publication attracted largely hostile comment (though later commentators recognised the usefulness of the practical recommendations). But Amos also added details in his book about the construction and use of a variety of farming implements. These included his own designs for a horse-drawn thistle cutter, sward-dresser and compound roller, and (less well-received because of doubts about its practicality) his own version of a tree transplanter. Moreover, he added his voice to those of fellow improvers by calling for the removal of 'obstacles that oppose the promoting, improving and extending' of agriculture, and he castigates 'gentlemen of landed property' for ignoring the proper management of their land.Minutes in Agriculture, pp. 51 & 66. Amos's other published writings span the years 1798‚Äì1816 and chiefly take the form of essays and letters in agricultural journals, covering a variety of topics from potato cultivation to his plans to design a workable reaping machine (in which endeavour, however, he later acknowledged he had been unsuccessful). He won a gold medal from the Board of Agriculture for two of these essays.\\"Breaking Up and Relaying Clay\\" & \\"Cabbages\\" in Communications to the Board of Agriculture, vol. iv (London, 1805), pp. 16‚Äì23 & 178. Of broader appeal, and attracting more interest, were his \\"Essays on Agricultural Machines\\" as published in the Board of Agriculture's Communications of 1810. These covered: a new design for a dynanometer (his spelling of dynamometer) for measuring the relative resistances of ploughs or the weight needed to draw them forward; the construction of a new roller and set of harrows; the breaking of horses and oxen; and the construction of carriage wheels 'upon a new principle'. The most important of these essays, however, was \\"On the Mathematical Construction of a Plough\\" in which he offered an original and practical solution to the problem of efficient plough design with special reference to the mouldboard.Communications to the Board of Agriculture, vol. vi, part ii, (London, 1810), pp.437‚Äì454. It was in the course of this essay that he challenged Thomas Jefferson's claim to have discovered the mathematical principles for constructing a mould-board of least resistance.Jefferson, Thomas. \\"The Description of a Mold-Board of the least resistence [sic]\\", Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, vol. 4 (1799), pp. 313‚Äì322. This prompted one of Jefferson's nineteenth-century admirers to vilify Amos posthumously,Henry S Randall, \\"President Jefferson's Plow\\" in Transactions of the New York State Agricultural Society, (Albany, 1863), vol. xxii (1862), pp. 66‚Äì73. though less partisan American critics subsequently declared Jefferson's design to be badly flawed.Transactions of the New York State Agricultural Society, (Albany, 1868), vol. xxvii (1867), pp. 412‚Äì413. Amos's approach to plough construction, though it built on the work of others, particularly of John Bailey (1750‚Äì1819), earned him a place in the history of plough design.See, for example, Encyclopedia Metropolitana or Universal Dictionary of Knowledge (1845), ed. Rev. Edward Smedley et al., vol. xiv, p.233.  Impact  The readership for Amos's books during his lifetime was probably only a few hundred, though his articles in Young's Annals of Agriculture and the Board of Agriculture's Communications would certainly have reached a greater number, and reviews and cyclopedia entries would have extended knowledge of his ideas still further.For example, R. W. Dickson, Practical Agriculture (London, 1805), vol. i, pp.16, 19, and Plate VIII; the entry on Drill Husbandry in the Society of Gentlemen's The Complete Farmer or Dictionary of Agriculture and Husbandry (London, 5th edn, 1807); and Thomas Potts, The British Farmer's Cyclopedia (London, 1808), entries on Drilling and Hoes. Unlike many of the best-known pioneers of the Agricultural Revolution, men such as Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester, Jethro Tull and Sir John Sinclair), Amos had neither the wealth nor the social standing to promote his ideas, but his publications establish him as an important contributor to the development of improved and evidence-based agricultural practice in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

They lived together in Greenwich Village and divorced three years later in 1951. He met his second wife, the Austrian-born dancer and theatrical designer Ruth Sobotka, in 1952. They lived together in New York's East Village from 1952 until their marriage in January 1955. They moved to Hollywood six months afterwards, where she played a brief part as a ballet dancer in Kubrick's film, Killer's Kiss (1955). The following year she was art director for his film, The Killing (1956). They divorced in 1957. During the production of Paths of Glory (1957) in Munich, Kubrick met and romanced young German actress Christiane Harlan, who played a small though memorable role. Kubrick married Harlan in 1958, and in 1959 they settled into a home in Beverly Hills with Harlan's daughter, Katherina, age six.LoBrutto, Vincent (1999). Stanley Kubrick: a Biography. Penguin Books. They also lived in New York, during which time Christiane studied art at the Art Students League of New York, later becoming an independent artist. Like Kubrick, she wanted \\"solace to think, study, and practice her craft,\\" writes LoBrutto. They remained together 40 years, until his death in 1999. Besides his stepdaughter, they had two daughters together, Anya and Vivian. Shortly after his death, Christiane assembled a personal collection of never-before-seen photographs and commentary into a book, Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures. Included among the photos was only one of Kubrick's family together, taken in 1960.Kubrick, Christiane.

I would see that, and he would talk about them very proudly.\\" The opinion was shared by Malcolm McDowell, who starred in A Clockwork Orange: \\"He was happily married.

Christiane Kubrick told the London Times how rough New York had become, with children having to be escorted to school by police, people being rude, and smashed glass all over the street. Although he thrived on the manic energy of New York, Kubrick soon adapted to the more genteel atmosphere of Britain.

See also Walker, 2000, p.360 In 1965 the Kubricks moved to Abbots Mead, Barnet Lane, just south of the Elstree/Borehamwood studio complex. This was a turn of the 19th century house, sold to him by Simon Cowell's father, Eric. Kubrick worked almost exclusively from this home for 14 years where, with some exceptions, he researched, invented special effects techniques, designed ultra-low light lenses for specially modified cameras, pre-produced, edited, post-produced, advertised, distributed and carefully managed all aspects of four of his films: 2001: A Space Odyssey (1965 to 1968), A Clockwork Orange (1969 to 1971), Barry Lyndon (1972 to 1975) and most of The Shining (1976 to 1980 - finished the year after he left for Childwickbury Green). In 1978, Kubrick moved into Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire, UK, a mainly 18th century building about north of London and a 10-minute drive from his previous home at Abbotts Mead. After finishing The Shining he went on to make Full Metal Jacket and lastly Eyes Wide Shut. He is interred on its grounds together with his eldest daughter Anya Kubrick. LoBrutto notes that living in the United Kingdom brought peace to the Kubrick family. After moving to Britain, recalls Christiane, one of the first British radio shows they heard was on gardening. The area's many landscaped parks, gardens and animals was an enormous contrast to New York. \\"It's very pleasant,\\" said Kubrick, \\"very peaceful, very civilized here. London is in the best sense the way New York was\\" in the early 1900s. His friend, screenwriter Michael Herr, points out that he did not live in Britain because he disliked America: Kubrick's home in the English countryside, a half-hour drive from London, gave him \\"energy, inspiration, and confidence,\\" states Walker. It provided him with a \\"favorable psychological climate in which to function,\\" with more privacy and time for reflection. Kubrick's close friend, Julian Senior, who was vice president for Warner Brothers' London office, compared Kubrick's lifestyle to \\"a medieval craftsman whose home was his workshop.\\" He did manage to stay up on current affairs, and read The New York Times daily, notes Jan Harlan, adding that Kubrick remained a \\"New Yorker\\" at heart his entire life.\\"An hour about the life and work of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick\\" , Video interview with Charlie Rose, Christiane Kubrick, Martin Scorsese and Jan Harlan.

They both made special effort to keep their home warm and friendly, yet they shared a need for privacy. She adds, \\"When Stanley is relaxed he plays chess and likes to be very quiet ... Stanley is so gentle, such a shy and sensitive person.\\" At home, children and animals would frequently come in and out of the room as he worked on a script or met with an actor. Kubrick's many dogs and cats, toward which he showed an extraordinary affection, were often brought onto film sets or editing rooms.Baxter 1999, p. 31. Diane Johnson, co-screenwriter of The Shining, notes that he enjoyed sharing his work with his family: \\"They all worked together, creating art and film on the kitchen table, so to speak ... Stanley was in no way an isolated individual, and never excluded his family from what he was doing.\\" Kubrick rarely left England during the remaining 40 years before he died. \\"He lived a simple (outer) life, and a largely devotional one,\\" writes Herr, who describes his home and workplace: Although Kubrick once held a pilot's license, some have claimed that he later developed a fear of flying and refused to take airplane trips.Rhodes 2008, p. 17. Matthew Modine, star of Full Metal Jacket, stated that the stories about his fear of flying were \\"fabricated,\\" and that \\"he wasn't afraid to fly.\\" He simply preferred spending most of his time in England, where his films were produced and where he lived.\\"'Full Metal Jacket' at 25: Matthew Modine tries to answer, 'What was Stanley like?'\\" Entertainment Weekly, Aug. 7, 2012 Emilio D'Alessandro, a former race-car driver, was his personal assistant at his home workplace for over 30 years, handling much of the day-to-day chores such as driving actors to and from his home. In his 2012 book, Stanley Kubrick & Me, he describes his personal experiences, saying that Kubrick wasn't simply his \\"employer but his university,\\" and that he was, \\"really like a father.\\"Book trailer for Stanley Kubrick & Me Kubrick kept in close contact with business associates in the U.S. and elsewhere, mostly by telephone, calling associates at all hours for conversations that lasted from under a minute to many hours. Many of Kubrick's admirers and friends spoke of these telephone conversations with great affection and nostalgia after his death. Kubrick also frequently invited people to his house, ranging from actors to close friends, admired film directors, writers, and intellectuals. He rarely took vacations, even after completing a major film, and would simply begin preparing for his next one by catching up on seeing movies that had come out during the last year and searching through books and magazines for his next project idea. Kubrick was an early user of desktop computers and had five that he worked with at home. LoBrutto describes Kubrick's home office: Screenwriter Michael Herr remembers working with him on Full Metal Jacket, in what he describes as Kubrick's home \\"War Room\\" which was a large space \\"crammed with desks and computers and filing cabinets\\" and \\"long trestle tables littered\\" with sketches and idea papers and photos of \\"streets, pagodas, prostitutes, shrines, and signs.\\" Personal characteristics His appearance was not well known in his later years, to the extent that a British man named Alan Conway successfully impersonated Kubrick locally for a number of years.Anthony 1999. Online at: The counterfeit Kubrick Biographer Vincent LoBrutto notes that his privacy led to spurious stories about his reclusiveness, \\"producing a mythology more than a man,\\" similar to those about Greta Garbo, Howard Hughes, and J.D. Salinger. Michael Herr, Kubrick's co-screenwriter on Full Metal Jacket, who knew him well, considers his \\"reclusiveness\\" to be myth: \\"[H]e was in fact a complete failure as a recluse, unless you believe that a recluse is simply someone who seldom leaves his house. Stanley saw a lot of people ... he was one of the most gregarious men I ever knew, and it didn't change anything that most of this conviviality went on over the phone.\\" He hated being photographed, notes Herr, although he let a few people, including his daughter, Vivian, take a few candids when working. Matthew Modine, who became close friends with Kubrick while working in Full Metal Jacket, describes how others saw him: Herr also describes his voice and conversational style, noting that he had an \\"especially fraternal temperament\\" and quite a few women found him \\"extremely charming.\\" He adds that despite his living in England, his Bronx accent was still noticeable, but added that his voice was fluent and \\"melodious\\". \\"it was as close to the condition of music as speech can get and still be speech\\" \\"Stanley always seemed supernaturally youthful to his friends,\\" writes Herr. \\"His voice didn't age over the almost twenty years that I knew him [and] he had a disarming way of 'leavening' serious discourse with low adolescent humor ...\\" Ciment adds that he was \\"soft-spoken, with a crisp, surprisingly youthful voice, alternately serious and humorous in tone.\\" Kubrick dressed simply, wearing the same style clothes every day: beat chinos, a basic blue work shirt, a ripstop cotton fatigue jacket with many pockets, and a pair of well- worn running shoes. \\"Many producers and actors thought he dressed like a beatnik\\", notes Herr, and his wife thought his baggy trousers made him look like a \\"balloon vendor.\\" His meals were also simple, \\"he has no time to waste,\\" writes Ciment. His eyes were \\"dark, focused, and piercing:\\" According to screenwriter Frederic Raphael, who worked with him on Eyes Wide Shut, \\"vanity was not his style; he never cited his own work with complacency and often admired other people's. He could be pitiless, but never conceited ... he solicited my views quite as if I were some venerable oracle.\\"Raphael, p. 159 That view was shared by Herr: \\"Nobody who really thinks he's smarter than everyone else could ask as many questions as he always did, ... and trying to see every movie ever made.\\" His inquisitiveness about photography and films started when he was a teenager. He later infiltrated film facilities around New York, hung around editing rooms, laboratories and equipment stores, constantly asking questions. Herr also notes similarities between Kubrick's temperament and satirist and comedian Lenny Bruce, who was nearly the same age, with their love of jazz, ball games, and their common hipster persona. His temperament as a hipster also reflected Kubrick's likes and dislikes in everyday society. Among those, writes Herr, were his aversions to \\"waste, haste, ... [and] bullshit in all its proliferating manifestations, subtle and gross, from the flabby political face telling lies on TV to the most private, much more devastating lies we tell ourselves.\\" According to Herr, Kubrick felt that \\"hypocrisy was not some petty human foible, it was the corrupted essence of our predicament ...\\" After he moved to England, Kubrick especially enjoyed watching his favorite TV shows, including The Simpsons, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, Seinfeld, and Roseanne, thinking they were excellent comedies that portrayed American life. He had friends in the U.S. send him tapes of television shows, along with sports events and news broadcasts. Gay Hamilton, one of the stars in Barry Lyndon, recalls one night she couldn't get his attention while he and Ryan O'Neal were watching a boxing video he received from the U.S. \\"He was fiercely unpretentious,\\" notes Herr. \\"He was exclusive, he had to be, but he wasn't a snob. It wasn't America he couldn't take. It was L.A.\\" According to Ciment, \\"social standing means nothing to him and he has no interest in acquiring it; money serves exclusively to guarantee him independence.\\" Desire for privacy Herr points out that most of what people knew about Kubrick came from the press, primarily the entertainment press. Few of the journalists that wrote about his life met him or knew much about it. He rarely gave interviews, \\"because he thought you had to be crazy to do interviews unless you had a picture coming out,\\" adds Herr, who contrasted this with the many celebrities eager for the spotlight and thought this contributed to the public image of Kubrick as reclusive. Among the notable aspects of his desire for privacy, in his home and film life, was that he never talked about his movies while they were being made. Nor did he like discussing them even afterwards, except to friends. He most of all avoided discussing their \\"meaning,\\" notes Herr, because \\"he believed so completely in their meaning that to try and talk about it could only spoil it\\" for the listener. \\"He might tell you how he did it, but never why.\\" When he was once asked how he thought up the ending for 2001, he replied, \\"I don't know. How does anybody ever think of anything?\\" This aspect of his penchant for privacy may have also contributed to the negative reviews of many of his films or about him personally. Herr states that \\"it can never turn out well when a square takes a hipster for his subject.\\" Similarly, Ciment argues that his refusal to \\"become one of the 'family' may have also \\"wrecked his chances of ever being honored\\" in Hollywood as a director, similar to the way Charlie Chaplin, Orson Welles and Robert Altman were denied Oscars, all of them considered at the time to be \\"rebels\\" within the film world. When he did grant interviews, he did so \\"with good grace and modesty,\\" writes Ciment. A chauffeur would drive reporters to either a pub or to his home office, which was also his editing room. Interviewers would join him in his room \\"piled high with cans of film, newspapers, files and card-indexes, like some enormous artist's loft in Montparnasse or Greenwich Village ‚Äì where this 'eternal student' can work away in privacy.\\" Death On March 7, 1999, four days after screening a final cut of Eyes Wide Shut for his family and the stars, Kubrick died in his sleep at the age of 70, after suffering a massive heart attack. His funeral was held on March 12 at his home estate with friends and family in attendance, totaling approximately 100 people. The media was kept a mile away outside the entrance gate. Alexander Walker, who attended the funeral, describes it as a \\"family farewell, ... almost like an English picnic,\\" with cellists, clarinetists and singers providing song and music from many of his favorite classical compositions. Although Kaddish, a prayer used during Jewish funerals, was recited, the funeral had no religious overtones, and few of his obituaries mentioned his Jewish background.Raphael, Frederic. Eyes Wide Open: A Memoir of Stanley Kubrick, Ballantine, 1999 pp. 107‚Äì108 Among those who gave eulogies were Terry Semel, Jan Harlan, Steven Spielberg, Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise.

Releases Catching Flies first came to prominence in October 2012, when his remix of Mt. Wolf's track \\"Life Size Ghosts\\" began to get hundreds of thousands of hits on YouTube and he got praise from scores of music blogs. Consequently, the track raced to the number one spot on the Hype Machine. This was followed by the release of his first EP, The Stars, which included 3 tracks of original music, plus the Mt. Wolf remix. The EP was released by Catching Flies for free on Bandcamp and received thousands of downloads. June 2013 saw the release of The Long Journey Home EP, again comprising three original tracks and one remix. This was self-released through his own label, Indigo Soul, on Bandcamp.

The release was accompanied by a short film about Catching Flies and his creative process, shot on 16mm film. It premiered on Nowness and received their pick of the day. Catching Flies' debut album Silver Linings was released on 5 July 2019. Future Music Magazine called it ‚Äòa brilliantly eclectic record‚Ä¶ a moving journey that will last long in the memory.‚Äô Earmilk gave the album 8.5/10 stars and dubbed it ‚ÄòA soundtrack to summertime‚Ä¶' and Clash (magazine) summarised: ‚ÄòKiller beats, a dreamy, atmospheric sound, and artfully orchestrated introspection.‚Äô Catching Flies released 'Silver Linings Remixed' on April 17th 2020.

Built in 1876, it is a local landmark of Victorian Italianate commercial architecture, serving as the main post office, and as a newspaper publishing house for many years. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Old Post Office Block is located in Manchester's downtown business district, on the north side of Hanover Street between two other historic buildings, the Harrington-Smith Block (once home to the Strand Theater) and the Palace Theatre. It is three stories in height, built out of brick with a projecting bracketed cornice at the top of its facade. The facade is fifteen bays wide, divided into groups of five by brick pilasters. The outer groups have second-floor windows with peaked lintels, and third-floor windows with shouldered flat lintels. The central section windows are more elaborately finished, with some lancet-arched surrounds. The block was constructed in 1876, built to serve both as a post office, and as home to the presses of the Mirror newspaper. It housed the newspaper operation until 1924, and the post office until 1891. In the mid-20th century it housed one of the city's largest department stores. The building's architect is not known, but may have been George Stevens, an engineer for the Amoskeag Mills, or Alpheus Gay, a builder who is credited with several high style Italianate buildings in the city, including his own house.

It ran from 13 April to 1 July 1922. It starred Eddie Cantor, who introduced the hit songs \\"Yes! We Have No Bananas\\" and \\"The Sheik of Araby\\". Production Harold R. Atteridge and Eddie Cantor wrote the book. Harold Atteridge wrote the lyrics to music by Jean Schwartz. Alfred Bryan and William B. Friedlander wrote additional lyrics, and Friedlander wrote additional music. The show was produced by The Winter Garden Company, with production supervised by Jacob J. Shubert and staged by Jesse C. Huffman. Louis Gress was musical director. Dell Lampe orchestrated the music and Allan K. Foster staged the musical numbers. The show ran at the Winter Garden from 13 April 1922 to 1 July 1922. Eddie Cantor headlined with Nan Halperin, J. Harold Murray and Lew Hearn. Shubert sent the show on tour after it had closed on Broadway. In Philadelphia, in the last week of the tour, Cantor introduced the song Yes! We Have No Bananas, written by Frank Silver and Irving Cohn. The song, later recorded by Cantor for the Victor Talking Machine Company, became the most popular novelty hit of the 1920s. Synopsis The show has been described as a \\"collation of froth\\". Some material was reused from an earlier Shubert show The Midnight Rounders. Eddie Cantor played a classic comedy sketch of \\"Max, the Tailor\\", a small man having to deal with an unreasonable customer who wanted a belt in the back ‚Äì and in the end got a different type of belt from the one he expected. Cantor did other sketches as a taxi driver and a very timid police academy candidate. Cantor premiered the song The Sheik of Araby, lyrics by Harry B. Smith and Francis Wheeler, music by Ted Snyder. This also became a major hit. The Eight Blue Devils put on a tumbling act. Act 2 opened with \\"Princess Beautiful (A Cleveland Bronner Ballet)\\". Ballet had been expected in all shows in the 1916‚Äì17 season, but by 1922 they were considered outdated. The show included various chorus spectacles. In one the girls were all costumed as pink roses. The girls used the runway to toss ice cream bricks to the audience in the orchestra seats. Reception The revue had a respectable run. It closed in July, as even the most popular New York shows did in the days before air conditioning. The New York Sun said of Cantor's performance that \\"Al Jolson now has a rival\\".

His writing style for Point Blank was very influential on Walter Hill.\\"How They Write A Script: Walter Hill\\" June 25, 2010 by Scott Go to the Story, accessed 30 May 2014 Biography Jacobs was born in London. He entered the British film industry in the 1940s, working in publicity and distribution. He wrote and directed for British TV and helped found the Free Cinema Group which was instrumental in the careers of such filmmakers as Tony Richardson, Lindsay Anderson and Karel Reisz. In the 1960s he was assistant to producer David Deutsch on the film Catch Us If You Can (1965) directed by John Boorman and costume designed by Jacobs' wife, Sally. Boorman later wrote about Jacobs: > [He was] my real ally, the one whose opinion I came to depend on for making > changes to the script... He looked not unlike Marty Feldman, the same square > Jewish face. He had been a pro cyclist, competed in the Tour de France, and > had smashed one side of his face in a bad fall. It had been rebuilt and a > glass eye fitted, so that he had a similar disconcerting way of looking yet > not looking at you, as Marty had. He was steeped in film and became my > passionate advocate and counsellor.Boorman p 117 Boorman says that one day Dave Clark, the star of the film, said \\"something insulting\\" to Sally (\\"he hated the clothes she made him wear\\") and Jacobs \\"flew into a rage. It was a terrifying sight. He frothed at the mouth. He smashed his fist into Dave's face.\\" Dave Clark was unable to film for three days and Alex Jacobs was banished from the set. When Boorman travelled to the US in November 1966 to make Point Blank he took Jacobs with him to write the script. \\"We had strong ‚Äì that is to say, arrogant ‚Äì views about films and film theory\\", said Boorman later.Boorman p 128-129 They wrote a draft in three weeks. According to one writer Point Blank was \\"a major achievement, a reworking of a classic gangster text into an explosive reverie on American alienation and madness.\\" The movie was a success and Jacobs and Boorman later collaborated on Hell in the Pacific although the two fell out over the project and Jacobs quit.Boorman p 145 Jacobs stayed in Hollywood for the rest of his career. Boorman: > Alex found his spiritual home in Hollywood. He was a movie buff. He could > pitch ideas. There was no one better at meetings. He was, as they say in > Hollywood, 'great in a room'. He eventually became a rewrite man, a script > doctor. When they had a project with intractable problems, they would send > for Alex. He would demolish the script, reduce it to rubble, then when > everyone was in despair, he would rebuild it into a potential masterpiece. I > used to marvel at his profligacy. 'There's the germ of a great idea here,' > he would say, slapping the script or twisting it in his hands, as though > squeezing out that little pip of importance from the hundred or so pages of > dross. Or, 'the audience is way ahead of you. The script is just the first > third of the movie.' He bamboozled. He bludgeoned. He knew how to cut > through to the quick, to what was essential, as he did on Point Blank. > Sitting down and writing it, justifying what he had improvised at the > meeting was another matter. He was at his best pacing a room. A typewriter > did not inspire him. He had the temperament of a producer rather than a > writer.Boorman p 144 Jacobs' obituary described \\"a quintessential Alexander Jacobs image\\" from the film Sitting Target: > The first scene... takes us into a dank prison cell. We hear menacing grunts > and stare in amazement at a grimacing, brutally determined convict \\"spread > eagled across the ceiling like some huge dark spider\\" as he struggles > through this bizarre isometric exercise. It's a spectacularly dynamic image > that sums up the character and charges the movie with instant power. Jacobs also worked as a script doctor. According to his obituary: > Too many were perfectly willing to let Alex serve merely as an adaptor, a > rescuer of troubled projects, a brain to be picked. They knew how unerringly > he could respond with a torrent of stimulating ideas. During meetings, even > the stodgiest of executives would find themselves fascinated by his > imagination and volatility. But Alex also scared them. He cared about his > work with an intensity they considered uncool. He wasn't some unmanageable > kid who would let himself be led by the nose in return for the chance to > make a movie. He knew world cinema too well for that. Indeed, he was a > constant magnet for people who, weary of the usual obsessive gossip about > what's going through the roof and what's bombing this week, wanted good, > lively talk about film itself. Alex was that rarity, an established > screenwriter who constantly helped the unknown and the inexperienced. Jacobs married Sally Rich (a stage and constume designer) in 1953.

Coire Dubh is in view. Beinn Bh√†n is a Scottish mountain situated in the Lochaber region of the Highland Council Area. It stands 6 miles (10 km) north-west of Spean Bridge. The hill is not to be confused with another and better known Beinn Bh√†n on the Applecross peninsula. Overview Beinn Bh√†n reaches a height of 796 metres (2612 feet) and qualifies as a Corbett and a Marilyn. The hill stands in Glen Loy, a minor side valley of the Great Glen and hill walkers will sometimes climb Beinn Bh√†n along with another Glen Loy Corbett, Meall a' Phubuill to give a full days walking . The hill's name translates from the Scottish Gaelic language as \\"White Hill\\", there are no natural features which could give this name and local knowledge says that the hill is so named because snow lies on Beinn Bh√†n earlier than any other hill in the district and it is this well- defined whiteness which led to the naming of the hill.\\"The Call Of The Corbetts\\", Irvine Butterfield, David & Charles, , Page 74 Gives etymology details. Much of the area around Beinn Bh√†n was used for the training of British Commandos and United States Army Rangers during World War II using the training depot at Achnacarry Castle on the NE foothills. The Scotsman Mentions WWII training and route. Munro Magic Gives details of routes, height and location. Geography Standing in a region which has some of the highest mountains in the UK, Beinn Bh√†n can be easily overlooked, however it is conspicuous in the view from the Commando Memorial at Spean Bridge, where its long NW ridge is well seen rising from Glen Mallie to the summit ridge overlooking the Great Glen. The hill has three notable corries on its slopes, the south facing Coire Mhuilinn (corrie of the mill) above Glen Loy is smooth and grassy, while the two north facing corries of Coire Bhotrais (corrie of the rough miry holes) and Coire Dubh (black corrie) are more rocky and steeper in nature. All three corries bite significantly and high into the hill to give a two kilometre long narrow curving summit ridge which is above the 750 metre contour for its entire length.\\"Climbing The Corbetts\\", Hamish Brown, Baton Wicks, , Page 249 Gives details of routes and geography. The highest point stands at the eastern end of the ridge and there are two lesser and unnamed tops, both with a height of 771 metres situated at the midpoint and western end. 200 metres west of the main summit are several springs which emerge on the summit ridge and are the origins of the stream which flows down Coire Mhuilinn. www.sub3000.com Gives details of geography. Summit and view The highest point is marked by a trig point and a substantial cairn. The hill has a prominence of 495 metres making it a fine view point. The view north takes in Loch Arkaig and its surrounding mountains but the highlight of the vista is south towards the Ben Nevis range, giving a fine prospect which looks straight up the valley of the Allt a Mhuillin and shows Britain's highest mountain to fine effect along with the neighbouring C√†rn M√≤r Dearg and Aonach M√≤r. Routes of ascent The most popular route of ascent and one which is recommended by most guide books approaches from the south, starting at the Inverskilavulin holiday development in Glen Loy. This route uses the ridges on both sides of Coire Mhuilinn for ascent and descent. It is possible to approach Beinn Bh√†n from the north, starting on the shore of Loch Arkaig with the possibility of using Invermallie bothy as a base.

Huffman (1869‚Äì1935) was an American theatrical director. Between 1906 and 1932 he directed or staged over 200 shows, mostly for the Shubert Brothers. Many of them were musical revues, musicals or operettas. He is known for The Passing Show series of revues that he staged from 1914 to 1924 at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway, daring alternatives to the Ziegfeld Follies. Early years Jesse C. Huffman was born in Bowling Green, Ohio, in 1869. His father had been a general in the American Civil War. Huffman became a boy actor at the age of twelve. Later he became stage director for the Harry Davis Stock Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was introduced to the New York theater scene by the actor Richard Mansfield. Huffman soon showed he had a talent as a director of book musicals with loose plots, and of musical revues. In 1911 Huffman was made general director for the shows staged by the Shubert brothers in New York and on the touring circuit. The Shuberts had the largest chain of theaters in the USA. Shows would first be played on Broadway, sometimes for just one day at the Ambassador Theatre so they could be advertised as \\"direct from Broadway\\", then sent on the road. The Shuberts arranged shows on a production line system. Sigmund Romberg composed or arranged the music; Harold R. Atteridge wrote the lyrics and librettos; Huffman directed the shows; Watson Barr designed the sets; and Allan K. Foster choreographed the dance numbers. Passing Show The Winter Garden Theatre in 1916, showing The Passing Show Huffman was responsible for The Passing Show series of revues from 1914 to 1924. The Shuberts first staged The Passing Show in 1912 in competition with the Ziegfeld Follies. Extravagant musical numbers and comedy sketches were roughly linked into an overall narrative. The Shubert staff writer Harold Atteridge prepared the book for the Passing Show of 1914, and continued with several subsequent shows. Huffman was credited with staging the revue, which presumably meant he handled overall direction, including blocking, and also was involved in set design and lighting. The Passing Show continued to compete with the Follies into the 1920s, offering a more risqu√© alternative where the girls came ever closer to being completely nude. The last Passing Show opened on 3 September 1924 and ran for 106 performances. Huffman was director, and other Shubert staff including Romberg, Atteridge and Barret supplied music, lyrics and sets. The show featured the song Nothing Naughty in a Nightie. Other musicals and revues Flyer for the Al Jolson vehicle Bombo (1921) staged by J.C. Huffman In February 1914 Huffman drew praise for the very modern stage settings used for Percy MacKaye's fantastic romance A Thousand Years Ago. Huffman also directed Al Jolson vehicles such as Robinson Crusoe, Jr. (1916), Sinbad (1918), Bombo (1921) and Big Boy (1925). Huffman was involved in many other Shubert musicals, particularly revues. In 1922 he staged Make It Snappy, a revue that starred Eddie Cantor. This was one of the \\"miscellaneously titled collations of froth\\" used to fill the Winter Garden Theatre while The Passing Show was away. As the Roaring Twenties progressed, shows became more daring. Huffman acquiesced in J.J. Shubert's demand that the girls in the 1923 revue Artists and Models show their bare breasts. There were two fully nude scenes in this show, drawing comment from the local papers. One critic wrote, \\"Never before in an American revue has a similar degree of nudity been obtained.\\" Out of town papers were scandalized, but described the show in considerable detail. The show reopened the Winter Garden on 15 November 1927, staged by Huffman, with arrangements of one hundred nude chorus girls as a bracelet and as a cathedral. It ran for nineteen weeks. Operettas Sheet music cover for The Rose of Stamboul (1922) In the 1920s Huffman staged or directed many operettas for the Shuberts. These included The Rose of Stamboul (1922), My Maryland (1927), The Circus Princess (1927) and Countess Maritza (1928). Other original Broadway productions of operettas included Blossom Time and The Student Prince. The operetta Blossom Time, with music by Franz Schubert arranged by Sigmund Romberg and lyrics and book by Dorothy Donnelly, opened at the Ambassador Theatre in New York on 29 September 1921 and ran for 592 performances. Huffman was the director. This was the second longest running musical of the 1920s. At one point Blossom Time was running simultaneously (with different casts but essentially the same crew) at the Shubert Theatre and at the 44th Street Theatre. The Student Prince in Heidelberg had music by Sigmund Romberg and book and lyrics by Dorothy Donnelly, based on the play Old Heidelberg by Rudolf Bleichman. The show, directed by Huffman, opened at Jolson's 59th Street Theatre in New York on 2 December 1924, and ran for 608 performances. The Student Prince opened at His Majesty's Theatre in London on 3 February 1926, again directed by Huffman, and ran for 96 performances. It was the longest-running musical of the 1920s. Last years Huffman directed shows throughout the 1920s and into the start of the 1930s. Nina Rosa, a musical play, ran for 137 performances at the Majestic Theatre in New York from 20 September 1930 to 17 January 1931. Lee and J.J. Shubert produced the show, and Huffman was credited with staging the entire production. Busby Berkeley said he had worked on the show, but was not credited, perhaps due to a disagreement with the Shuberts. Jesse C. Huffman died in 1935. It has been estimated that he directed or staged over 200 shows during his career.

He was the alleged communication's chief and personal bodyguard of Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n, once considered Mexico's most-wanted drug lord. On 22 February 2014, he was arrested by the Mexican Navy along with Guzm√°n at a beach resort area in Mazatl√°n, Sinaloa. Early life and career Carlos Manuel Hoo Ram√≠rez, also known by his alias \\"El C√≥ndor\\", was born in Los Mochis, Sinaloa, Mexico on 15 October 1978. On 1 June 1997, when he was eighteen years old, he enlisted in the Mexican Armed Forces as an infantry soldier in the Mexican Army. At that time, Hoo Ram√≠rez was single, had a middle school degree, and was already in the workforce as a laborer. Following a medical and psychological entrance exam, he was accepted into the military. During his tenure in the Army, he was relocated three times: on 1 November 1998, 16 December 1998, and on 16 March 1999. He was also a member of the 209 Grupo Aeromovil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFEs), an elite special forces unit of the Army, with their center of operations in Culiac√°n, Sinaloa. As a special forces soldier, Hoo Ram√≠rez was trained in the jungles and learnt several survival skills in extreme environments, patrolling protocols, basic and advance navigation skills, about the flora and fauna in combat environments, among other things. By the end of the training session, the special soldiers were required to be able to swim more than 1,300 m (4,265 ft) with their uniforms, weapon, and equipment. After more than three years, however, Hoo Ram√≠rez applied to be discharged from the Army on 1 September 2000, citing that there were family issues that required his full attention. An anonymous source from the Mexican Armed Forces confirmed that Hoo Ram√≠rez was recruited by the Sinaloa Cartel, a Mexican drug trafficking organization, shortly after its leader Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n escaped from prison on 19 January 2001. Guzm√°n had a preference for recruiting former members of the Mexican Armed Forces; given Hoo Ram√≠rez's military background, he was an ideal candidate for the drug lord's repertoire, and quickly rose in the cartel's ranks as one of the men in his inner circle. By 2010‚Äì2011, Hoo Ram√≠rez grew closer to Guzm√°n and started to gain his trust. He was considered well-versed with high-tech, and was the alleged communication's chief of Guzm√°n. During his three years on the job, Hoo Ram√≠rez became one of Guzm√°n's most trusted lieutenants, and worked as his personal assistant and bodyguard. Manhunt of Guzm√°n During his time on the run, Guzm√°n became the top leader of the Sinaloa Cartel and Mexico's most-wanted drug lord. He dodged law enforcement efforts to re-arrest him for more than thirteen years. However, by late 2013 and early 2014, authorities began to arrest several high-ranking enforcers in the cartel and got closer to Guzm√°n's whereabouts. On 17 February 2014, Guzm√°n and Hoo Ram√≠rez were tracked down by Mexican law enforcement at a security house in Libertad neighborhood in Culiac√°n after they intercepted the drug lord's cellphone signal. When the Mexican Navy tried to break down the entrance door of the property, they discovered that the door was steel-reinforced; when they finally gained access to the premises, the house was empty. The soldiers made their way to every room and soon discovered that the bathtub in the restroom was raised with a hydraulic lift and that there was a secret tunnel underneath it that connected to the city's sewage system. They made their way into the tunnel and attempted to follow Guzm√°n, but both of them had a ten-minute start advantage. After more than a mile in pursuit, the soldiers reached a dead end while Hoo Ram√≠rez and Guzm√°n managed to escape. A day before this incident, U.S. authorities successfully tracked down the signal of Hoo Ram√≠rez's cellphone, and managed to use that information to locate other high-ranking members of the Sinaloa Cartel, in addition to identifying a stash house owned by the cartel. After Hoo Ram√≠rez and Guzm√°n managed to lose their tail from law enforcement, they escaped from the sewage system through a storm drain outside of Culiac√°n, where they were picked up by a Sinaloa Cartel associate and then transferred to another vehicle. That same day, Mexican authorities raided the domicile of Hoo Ram√≠rez in Culiac√°n but no one was inside the house when the raid took place. On 20 February 2014, Hoo Ram√≠rez turned on his cellphone to contact one of his aides, and authorities tracked down the signal to Mazatl√°n, Sinaloa. Thinking that Guzm√°n had already retreated to one of his hideouts in the mountains, they decided to move on to apprehend Hoo Ram√≠rez in efforts to track down the drug lord's inner circle even more. =Arrest and imprisonment= The signal of Hoo Ram√≠rez's cellphone took authorities to Hotel Miramar, a twenty-story condominium complex at a beach resort area in Mazatl√°n. From the registration records, they discovered that two apartments there had been rented the previous day, on the fourth and sixth floors. When the soldiers of the Mexican Navy made their way to the fourth floor, they saw Hoo Ram√≠rez guarding the entrance door of Apartment #401 with an AK-47 assault rifle. Seeing that he stood no chance against them, Hoo Ram√≠rez surrendered and was arrested. The soldiers then entered the apartment, located Guzm√°n in one of the bedrooms, and proceeded to apprehend him as well. By 6:40 a.m. on 22 February 2014, the Mexican Navy had arrested Hoo Ram√≠rez and Guzm√°n without a single shot fired. Following his arrest, Hoo Ram√≠rez was transferred to the federal installations of SEIDO, Mexico's anti-organized crime investigatory agency, where he gave his statement and was interrogated by law enforcement. He remained at the SEIDO installations for three days. On 26 February 2014, he was transferred by the Procuradur√≠a General de la Rep√∫blica (PGR) to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 (sometimes referred to simply as \\"Altiplano\\"), a maximum-security prison in Almoloya de Ju√°rez, State of Mexico, accused of violating Mexico's Federal Law of Firearms and Explosives. That day, he appeared before a federal judge in Toluca to face the charges against him. At the moment of his arrest, he had 60 cartridges, an assault rifle, and a grenade-launcher. On 7 March 2014, a federal judge in the State of Mexico set his trial to motion and formally charged him for his alleged violations of Mexican law. On 22 February 2015, Hoo Ram√≠rez was granted a writ of amparo (effectively equivalent to an injunction) by a federal court after his defense claimed that authorities did not follow the judicial protocol accordingly after his client was arrested. The purpose of the injunction was to work for the removal of Hoo Ram√≠rez's formal charges.

After the reunification of Vietnam (1975), he was among the few professors who did not emigrate and stayed in Dalat University, even though during the next ten years he was not allowed to teach.Dr. B√πi VƒÉn H√πng, ¬´ 24 nƒÉm nghi√™n c·ª©u v√† ƒë√†o t·∫°o c·ª≠ nh√¢n l·ªãch s·ª≠ ·ªü tru·ªùng √ê·∫°i h·ªçc √ê√† L·∫°t ¬ª, (24 years of History Research and Students Formation at Dalat University) 2010: ¬´ History teachers came from T√¢y Nguy√™n University to Dalat University: L√™ ƒê√¨nh B√°, Nguy·ªÖn C·∫£nh Hu·ªá, Nguy·ªÖn Th√¥ng, Cao Th·∫ø Tr√¨nh, Ho√†ng Th·ªã Nh∆∞ √ù, Thu Nhung Ml√¥ as well as professors Nguy·ªÖn Kh·∫Øc T·ª•ng and L√™ H·ªìng B√¨nh from Hanoi, and professor Nguy·ªÖn H·ªìng Gi√°p, former teacher of Dalat University, have formed the first teaching team of the Faculty of History. ¬ª He rather took part in the preservation of the university off material decays.ƒêinh Th·ªã Nh∆∞ Thu√Ω, √ê·ªçt Chu·ªëi Non, 2008, http://dotchuoinon.com, ¬´ √ê√† Lat trong t√¥i v√† nh·ªØng ƒëi·ªÅu ƒë√£ m·∫•t ¬ª (Dalat Inside Me and Nostalgia of Lost Memories): The abrupt slope starting from La Si Mi Fa rice soup food shop hold by Professor and Doctor in History Nguy·ªÖn H·ªìng Gi√°p, and leading to the empty space in front of the Faculty of Literature university residence still challenges carts pulled by old and hungered horses. The tired and disrupted clacking of hoofs mingles with wind raffles blowing around pine trees hills makes the night sounds wetter and longer. We suddenly think that it is quite impossible to not care about the heavy weight of life, full of pleasure as well of sorrow. / Professor Nguy·ªÖn H√¥ng Gi√°p left Sorbonne to come back to his country; for some long time, he was not allowed to teaching. He opened a rice soup shop for students. It was rice soup with a loaf of grilled rice cake. Dalat sweet potatoes with flavored red flesh, spiced with a mixture of salt and chili peppers. La Si Mi Fa rice soup bowls have impressed my mind as well as the silhouette of our respectable professor walking upward from Ph√π ƒê·ªïng Thi√™n V∆∞∆°ng five streets crossroads until the university residence. He gave us a smiling salute, one hand holding a tin bucket, the other hand holding tongs used to keep up horse manure. He kept horse manure to enrich his flowers ground and coffee trees‚Ä¶ Professor Gi√°p lives now in Saigon. At that epoch many times I would like to ask him questions but I never dared to, as I felt so confused. Have you had regrets? How come did you leave Paris and your lovely Eurasian wife to come here cooking rice soup and keeping horse manure ? To give us a smiling salute and distillate into our mind a lancinante interrogation about man fate? / Of course the rice shop has now disappeared. I do not know among all the people remembering ƒêa Thi·ªán district in Dalat, how many could remember the hill carving ground tight space agenced with pine wood chairs and tables and named with La Si Mi Fa sounding musical notes. Myself I could always wholly see it, as I always distinctly see the star wrapped big cross on the top of NƒÉng Tƒ©nh triangulum high tower watching over Dalat University. People told me professor Gi√°p was one of the three men who have climbed on the top of this 38 meters high tower to wrench the branches of the cross wrapping star, allowing the cross to stand intact and harmless. Then he studied the life of various T√¢y Nguy√™n ethnic people (he is the co-author with Pr.

Prior to industrialization, Newtown Creek hosted a sizable population of mussel on its bottom and at the confluence of Maspeth Creek and Newtown Creek was Mussel Island, an uninhabited patch of marshland that survived into the 1940s. With hundreds of thousands of vessels traveling through Newtown Creek in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, this island posed a navigation hazard, forcing boats to tightly swerve around it. In 1921, Congress approved a dredging project for Newtown Creek that proposed to eliminate Mussel Island in favor of a \\"turning basin\\" that would enable larger vessels to turn around. By the end of the following decade, the project was completed and the island disappeared beneath the water. Map company Hagstrom continued to mark the island on its maps until October 2000, when a reader asked The New York Times about the island and Hagstrom conceded that it no longer belonged on the map.

It is made of bronze and was funded by donations collected from the city in 1854 and 1855. Ponciano Ponzano, a Spanish sculptor was commissioned to do the work. It was erected amidst festive ceremonies on 14 July 1860 near Teatro Alfonso XII in Arroceros in what is now Plaza Lawton (now Liwasang Bonifacio). Political upheavals in Spain led to the downfall of the Queen Isabel II and the rise of the liberal government in 1868. One of its officials, Carlos Mar√≠a de la Torre, was appointed governor-general of the Philippines. It was not long before he set on removing the remnants of the old regime in Manila. The task of destroying the monument was given to Bartolome Barretto, a government official. A sympathizer of the Spanish crown, he refused to carry out the task. Chinese workers were hired to remove the statue and Barretto hid it in his house before the Ayuntamiento reclaimed it. The Sociedad Econ√≥mica de los Amigos del Pa√≠s (Economic Association of Friends of the Country) requested that the statue be made part of their museum collection but de la Torre consigned it to a storeroom in the Casas Consistoriales. The statue was brought out and erected in front of the Malate Church in 1896. It remained there for over half a century until in 1970 when it was blown down by Typhoon Yoling. The monument was transferred to its present site during the visit of the then Prince Juan Carlos of Spain in 1975.

North Borneo Self-government Day is a self-government day celebrated on 31 August every year by the state of Sabah in Malaysia. Since 2012, the holiday has been received widely by the Sabah state government and the citizens of Sabah, as the Hari Merdeka was not the right celebration day for the state. While North Borneo Self-government Day is often referred to as 'Independence Day', this is strictly speaking incorrect, since British legislation on North Borneo's self-government did not provide for its independence prior to it joining to form the federation of Malaysia. In 2018, the Borneo Heritage Foundation (BHF) has called the state government to gazette the day as \\"Sabah Day\\" and declare it as a state holiday.  Background  After the end of the World War II, the territory was administered by the British Military Administration which later transferred to the Crown Colony government in 1946 as the British North Borneo Chartered Company facing a difficulties due to the high cost to reconstructing North Borneo. The task to reconstructing the territory was later taken by the Crown colony government with the first Crown Colony Governor appointed was Edward Twining on 5 May 1949. Ralph Hone succeeded him to continue the reconstruction of the territory and later Roland Turnbull until the last Crown Colony governor of William Goode. After all the reconstruction projects been completed, the Crown Colony government later decided to grant a self-government to the territory on 31 August 1963 which is 16 days before the establishment of the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963.  Relationship with Hari Merdeka  North Borneo Self-government Day, 31 August, also happens to be Hari Merdeka (Independence Day), a national day of Malaysia commemorating the independence of the Federation of Malaya from British colonial rule in 1957. The Borneo Heritage Foundation and Sabah DAP have stated that they will be celebrating 'Sabah Independence Day' instead of Hari Merdeka on that day. Starting from 2015, as was stated by the Minister of Communication and Multimedia Ahmad Shabery Cheek, the Independence Day celebration is likely to be held without mentioning the number of years to prevent the people in Sabah and Sarawak from being isolated if the number of independence anniversaries was stated. However, the Minister of Land Development of Sarawak Tan Sri Datuk Amar Dr James Masing reminded that since 16 September had been declared as Malaysia Day, it should be the rallying point for the nation's unity. He added \\"Everyone now knows that 31 August is Malaya's and Sabah's Independence Day‚Ä¶ it's not our (Sarawak) independence day. They can celebrate it both in Malaya and in Sabah as they have the same Independence Day date, and we can join them there if they invite us. We must right the wrong\\". Masing was commenting on Shabery Cheek‚Äôs recent proposal that Malaysia should continue to commemorate 31 August as its Independence Day, without mentioning the anniversary year.

It is a comic mock-melodrama, written to raise funds for charity. It has been revived occasionally, in tandem with other short works by Shaw or by other playwrights. Background Shaw began writing the play in May 1905 and finished it on 4 June. It was published in Harry Furniss's Christmas Annual 1905, and was privately printed for copyright purposes in the US in the same year. It first appeared in book form in Translations and Tomfooleries, 1926.Shaw (1987) Shaw wrote of the piece, \\"This tragedy was written at the request of Mr Cyril Maude, under whose direction it was performed repeatedly, with colossal success, in a booth in Regent's Park, for the benefit of The Actors' Orphanage, on the 14th July 1905\\". Brandon Thomas and Lionel Brough stationed themselves outside the tent drumming up custom for the show.\\"The Actors' Orphanage Fund\\", The Times, 15 July 1905, p. 8 Cast The original performers, from left to right: Vanbrugh, Price, Lewis, Maude, Pawle, Williams and Huntley *Lady Magnesia FitzTollemache ‚Äì Irene Vanbrugh *Phyllis, her maid ‚Äì Nancy Price *George FitzTollemache ‚Äì Eric Lewis *Adolphus Bastaple ‚Äì Cyril Maude *The Landlord ‚Äì Lennox Pawle *Police Constable ‚Äì Arthur Williams *Doctor ‚Äì G. P. Huntley *Choir of Invisible Angels ‚Äì Messrs Mason, Tucker, Maney, Humphreys Plot Period: \\"Not for an age but for all time\\". Scene: A bed sitting-room in a fashionable quarter of London.Shaw (1934), p. 1113 Late at night, Phyllis, the maid, is combing the hair of her employer, Lady Magnesia FitzTollemache. Phyllis expresses foreboding and the fear that she will never see her beloved mistress again. Magnesia retires to sleep, serenaded by a heavenly choir singing \\"Won't You Come Home Bill Bailey\\". A murderous figure enters, brandishing a dagger. Before he can stab Magnesia she wakes, and recognises her husband. Her admirer, Adolphus, demands admittance so that he can show her his new suit of evening clothes made of bright yellow and black cloth with a silver-spangled waistcoat and red kerchief.Shaw (1934), pp. 1114‚Äì1115 Fitz offers Adolphus a whisky and soda. The gazogene (soda- siphon) contains poison and Adolphus is soon writhing on the floor. Magnesia declares that with Adolphus dead she will have to devote all her energies to doting on her husband. Finding this prospect overwhelming, Fitz reveals that there is an antidote to the poison, namely lime, which they can get from the plaster of the ceiling. They throw boots up to bring pieces of the ceiling down. Adolphus cannot force the plaster down this throat, and instead Magnesia reaches for a plaster bust of herself, which she bids Phyllis dissolve in hot water. Adolphus drinks the mixture, and with the poison neutralised he sinks into a deep sleep.Shaw (1930), pp. 1115‚Äì1117 The FitzTollemaches' landlord appears, complaining at the noise from the room. He believes that the recumbent Adolphus is dead, accuses the others of murdering him, and summons the police. The constable cannot rouse Adolphus, and discovers that the plaster has set inside him, turning him into a living statue. A doctor arrives as a violent storm breaks. Lightning fatally strikes the doctor, the policeman and the landlord. The FitzTollemaches raise the statue upright and kneel before it, as the heavenly choir again sings \\"Bill Bailey\\". The statue raises its hands in benediction, the band plays the national anthem and attendants pass through the auditorium ejecting the audience.Shaw (1934), pp. 1118‚Äì1119 Later productions The BBC broadcast a radio version of the play in 1926, and the early BBC television service transmitted another in 1939.\\"Wirelessed Shaw\\", The Times, 20 January 1926, p. 10; and \\"Broadcasting\\", The Times, 15 June 1939, p. 12 The play was staged in London in 1945,\\"Chanticleer Theatre\\", The Times, 26 July 1945, p. 8 and again as part of a Shaw Festival at the Arts Theatre in 1951.\\"A Shaw Festival\\", The Times, 22 February 1951, p. 8 This was the last production in London during Shaw's lifetime.

The foundation was established in 2003 and supports the indigenous people of that country. The Foundation provides education, health, and community service programmes such as disaster relief, microbusiness promotion and sustainable ecotourism. History of the Kokoda Track Foundation The Kokoda Track Foundation is an Australian not-for-profit organisation that works with the communities living along and around the Kokoda Track in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Following its formation in 2003, the KTF funded and prepared a Strategic Plan for Tourism for the Kokoda Track. The Kokoda Track Foundation lobbied for, and on 11 June 2003, the PNG government established, the Kokoda Track Special Purpose Authority (KTA). The KTA's first action was the development of an ecotrekking strategy to enable the people along the track \\"to optimise the benefits from tourism and enable them to take a leading role in their own development\\". The Foundation initially started provided young children in PNG with school scholarships. Over the years, the Foundation increased its support to include other areas of health, education and welfare. The Chairman of KTF is Patrick Lindsay and Dr. Genevieve Nelson is the Executive Director of the foundation. Board members include Yahoo Serious and Bill James (co-founder of Flight Centre).  KTF in Papua New Guinea  The foundation currently works in four main areas: education, health, community development and micro-business. =Education programs= Fuzzy Wuzzy Angel Scholarships The Foundation supports elementary, primary, secondary and tertiary students with Fuzzy Wuzzy Angel Scholarships. The scholarships cover students' tuition fees, educational resources and uniform, food, and boarding (where applicable). In 2014, the Foundation provided more than 450 students with Scholarships. Kokoda College The Kokoda College is a planned state-of-the-art training facility based in remote Kou Kou village. It will offer courses in Elementary & Primary Teaching and Community Health Work. Elementary and Primary Teacher Training The Foundation has trained more than 60 elementary teachers and assisted members of the communities to train as primary teachers via the PNG Diploma of Primary Teaching. These teachers will return to their home villages to operate the schools after they have graduated from the course. School Resource and Infrastructure Support In 2014, KTF continued to support 43 elementary, primary and secondary schools with educational resources including textbooks and library books, stationery, teacher resources, furniture, and general maintenance for classrooms. Archer Leadership Scholars Program The Foundation's Archer Leadership Scholars program, funded by the Fred P.

Once qualified, these community members return to their home village and operate the local aid post. The foundation funds the salaries of Community Health Workers along the Track to ensure that aid posts and health centres remain open and health services are available to local villagers. The foundation also funds and delivers vital drugs and medical resources to aid posts and health centres in the Kokoda Track catchment area including the Kokoda Memorial Hospital. =Microbusiness= This year the foundation is continuing the Pawa Givim Meri project in eleven villages along the Kokoda Track. Via Pawa Givim Meri, small business workshops, cooking classes, and literacy training are run with women's groups in villages, assisting them to earn an income from the trekking industry. The women are establishing permanent shop fronts from which they can sell their food and products like solar lights to passing trekkers.http://www.iconadventures.com.au/uploads/doc/Kokoda_Track_Foundation_-_12_months_of_achievements_FINAL_email.pdf =Community development programs= Lighting Up The Track The Kokoda Track Foundation delivers solar lights ‚Äì to date this has been a total of 4,500 lights ‚Äì one for every adult along the track! Solar lighting has enormous benefits for communities and helps to alleviate poverty, improve health, and enhance educational opportunities for young children. Communities have been given a vital source of light that is changing lives. Disaster Relief The foundation has responded to disasters including flooding and cyclones in the volatile Oro Province. In January 2013, KTF responded to severe flooding that submerged the food gardens of thousands of villagers. KTF arranged the delivery of rice and tinned fish to hundreds of villages during the crucial periods when their food gardens were submerged and couldn't be accessed. Sustainable Ecotourism Immediately following the formation of the Kokoda Track Foundation, KTF funded and prepared a Strategic Plan for Tourism for the Kokoda Track and lobbied for PNG government support of the plan. The plan focuses on the environmental, economic, social and cultural aspects of tourism development. KTF now partners with key groups to ensure appropriate implementation of the plan and to ensure that local communities benefit from the growing trekking industry.

The film stars Josh Wiggins, Mia Xitlali, Dejon LaQuake, Thomas Haden Church, Robbie Amell, Lauren Graham, Luke Kleintank, and Jay Hernandez. The film was released by Warner Bros. on June 26, 2015. Plot Max, a Malinois used to help U.S. Marines in Afghanistan, is handled by Kyle Wincott (Robbie Amell) (Marine MWD). Kyle is questioned when weapons seized by his squad go missing. Realizing his friend Tyler Harne (Luke Kleintank) is among those involved with the shady dealings, he warns Tyler that he cannot cover for him. The two then go into the battlefield with their squad, with Max on point. While advancing on a suicide bomber, Max is injured by an explosion. In the ensuing gunfight, Kyle is shot and killed. Kyle's brother Justin (Josh Wiggins), who makes money selling illegally copied video games, their mother Pamela (Lauren Graham) and their father Ray (Thomas Haden Church) are informed of his death. After Kyle's body is brought home for burial, the other Marines notice that Max is only calm when he is around Justin, apparently sensing that he is Kyle's brother. The family adopts the dog, who would otherwise be euthanized for his disturbed behavior. Justin initially wants little to do with Max but eventually warms up to him. While meeting up with his friend Chuy (Dejon LaQuake), Justin meets Chuy's cousin Carmen (Mia Xitlali), who offers to go to his house and show him some handling tricks for Max. Little by little, Max's behavior improves around other people. Tyler visits the Wincott's one evening, provoking an aggressive response by Max. Later, after the Fourth of July, Ray asks Tyler what really happened. Tyler implies that Max turned on Kyle and caused him to discharge his weapon on himself, leading to his death. Justin decides to investigate the matter. He receives a DVD of Kyle training Max; he later contacts a friend of Kyle, Sergeant Reyes, for help. Later, Justin is approached by Chuy's other cousin Emilio (Joseph Julian Soria), a cartel member, who presses him over a video game bootleg. Afterwards, Justin and Max follow Emilio into the woods, where they secretly observe a meeting between cartel members and Tyler, who tries selling stolen weapons to them. The cartel's dogs sense Max and run after him. Max fights them off, severely wounding one of the dogs, while Justin runs away and leaves his bike behind. When he gets home, he finds Tyler and Stack, the cartel's dog handler, who was injured in the melee. Feigning innocence, they accuse Max of doing harm and demand his euthanization. Max is taken by animal control officers but escapes. Meanwhile, Ray catches Tyler making a business deal with the cartel but is held hostage by Emilio. Max makes it home and leads Justin, Chuy, and Carmen into the woods to rescue Ray. Confronting the cartel, they incapacitate Emilio and the last cartel dog and rescue Ray. Tyler and Stack chase after Justin and Ray, but Stack is killed after crashing his off-road pickup truck. Tyler corners Justin at a damaged bridge, but is attacked by Max. The two are knocked over the side of the bridge; while Tyler is killed by the fall, Max survives. Afterwards, Emilio is arrested and sent to jail. The family welcomes Max into their home. After Justin and Max visit Kyle's grave, they invite Chuy and Carmen over for dinner.

Though it flew in three successive Rh√∂n (Wasserkuppe) contests, it failed to match the achievements of its predecessor. Design and development The first Akaflieg Hannover glider was the Vampyr monoplane, which flew successfully at the first Rh√∂n contest in 1921 and was probably the first heavier-than-air machine to use stressed skin construction. The Greif was a development of the Vampyr, sharing its high, thick wing, short fuselage configuration and retaining its tail, though both wing and fuselage were new. The Greif's wing was a cantilever, three-part structure, mounted on top of the fuselage. It had a short rectangular centre section only wide and was entirely plywood-covered. Outboard the wings were straight tapered, with sweep only on the trailing edge. Each part was built around a single main spar, located at one third chord and swept slightly forward in the outer panels; there was an auxiliary spar in the centre section but not elsewhere. Beyond the centre section, for a little over half the span, plywood skin from the spar around the leading edge formed a torsion resistant box. Behind the spar the wing was fabric covered, as was all of the outer half apart from ply strengthening of the extreme tips. Lateral control was by wing warping rather than the ailerons initially fitted to the Vampyr. The Vampyr had a fuselage with a simple rectangular cross-section but that of the Greif was more refined, with an elliptical section, though both were rather similar in profile. Both fuselages were completely ply skinned over wooden bulkheads and stringers. The Greif's wing was mounted closer to the fuselage than on its predecessor, with the consequence that a cut-out had to be made in the leading edge for the pilot's head. This turned out to have deleterious aerodynamic effects. Its undercarriage consisted of a pair of semi-recessed wheels with balloon tyres on the centreline, one under the nose and the other larger one under the wing spar. The tail surfaces of the Greif were very similar to those of the Vampyr; a rectangular all-moving tailplane was hinged at the extreme rear of the fuselage with the rudder hinged at the same point. The fin was broad as required by the short fuselage; fin and rudder had straight vertical edges and a straight, rising top. The bottom of the rudder was parallel with its top, leaving room the tailplane movement. Operational history Both the Vampire and the Greif flew at the 3rd Rh√∂n contests in the summer of 1922. It was expected than the Greif would out-perform the older Vampyr but despite encouraging early trials it did not; on the same day and under similar conditions the Vampyr flew for over three hours but the Greif could only manage 26 minutes. The cut-out in the leading edge for the pilot seems to have greatly increased the induced drag; the losses were much greater than those caused by similar sized trailing edge cut-outs on other designs, as the pressure differences between upper and lower surfaces and the strength of the associated lossy vortexes are smaller there. Nevertheless, the Greif competed at the next two Rh√∂ns, becoming well known though without distinction. By 1923 the horizontal tail had been modified to a fixed-tailplane-and-elevator configuration. Its last flight, at the Zugspitze competition in January 1925, ended with a collision into a wooden fence on landing in Garmisch- Partenkirchen that destroyed the Greif.

The park occupies 75 acres along the West Twin River. Cherney Maribel Caves consists of seven caves along a rugged cliff line that runs parallel with the West Twin River.  History  The Cherney Maribel Caves were formed primarily by solution prior to the last ice age. Glaciers wore down the surface of the land and exposed a layer of rock called Niagara Dolomite, exposing crevices and sinkholes, allowing water to easily enter the caves. As the glaciers melted, the rushing water enlarged the existing caves, and later partially filled them with silt and gravel as the flow of water receded. The rushing melt water also carved the river valley. Since then, frost action has loosened rock from the cliff face, partially closing the cave entrances. About 1892, the first of the caves were discovered on the property of Henry A. Alrich, and was soon purchased by Charles Steinbrecher, who, in 1900, built the nearby Maribel Caves Hotel. Over the next several decades, tourists came to see the caves. In 1931, Adolph Cherney bought the property, including the nearby hotel. On November 5, 1963, Cherney sold the cave property to Manitowoc County for $16,200, leading to it becoming the first Manitowoc County park.  Caves  = Coopers Cave = Coopers Cave is located about midway along the park bluff. The cave has a large rectangular entrance and also has a small crevice entrance. It is a square tube solutional cave that is quiet and dry. About nine feet below the entrance is a natural spring that flows year round into the West Twin River. = Staircase Cave = Staircase Cave is a small relatively inaccessible cave. = Pancake Cave = Pancake Cave is difficult to reach because no trails lead to it. The cave is about eight feet deep and is shaped like a pancake. = Tunnel Passage = Cave entrance at Cherney Maribel Caves County Park Tunnel Passage, discovered in 2005, is about 20 feet long and approximately three feet in height. = Spring Cave = Spring Cave is a small inaccessible cave located on adjacent private property. A natural spring that flows from the cave was previously used by the nearby Maribel Caves Hotel. = Maribel New Hope Cave = Maribel New Hope Cave is the largest cave in Manitowoc County. It was discovered on Sunday, February 5, 1984. It is noted for its walking passageways, and is lighted by electric floodlights. It contains examples of stalactites, stalagmites, helictites, and cave bacon. The cave is a public show cave. It is open the 3rd Sunday of every month from May through October from 10 am to 3 pm. The cave is still being excavated and explored further by members of the Wisconsin Speleological Society. College instructors use this cave as a living laboratory. = Tartarus Cave System = The Tartarus Cave System is a large system of caves in the park that is still being excavated. It has three entrances: Tunnel Passage Entrance, the Tartarus Cave Entrance, and the Split Rock Cave Entrance. =Cave of Treasures= This is a cave that is located to the south just beyond the Tartarus Cave System in the same bluff. It is the most recently discovered cave by the Wisconsin Speleological Society. It consists of a three to four foot high horizontal entrance, that leads to over 70 feet of hands and knees crawlway passages. It is believed that further excavation, or digging, will open up passageway continuations so it will eventually connect it up to the Tartarus Cave System just to the north.Wisconsin Speleological Society  Features  The park offers a playground, a picnic area, and hiking and biking trails. A picnic shelter with bathrooms is located in the picnic area. Along the cliff line are several varieties of rare ferns, along with creeping plants and wild flowers. The beauty of the area made it a popular tourist destination even before Manitowoc County acquired the property in 1963.  2013 Tornado  In August 2013, a tornado ripped through Cherney Maribel Cave County Park. It destroyed more than 75 percent of the trees, the picnic shelter, and the restrooms.

The first component features tiny hooks, the second features smaller loops. When the two are pressed together the hooks catch in the loops and the two pieces fasten or bind temporarily. When separated, by pulling or peeling the two surfaces apart, the strips make a distinctive \\"ripping\\" sound. History Tiny hooks can be seen covering the surface of this bur. The design of hook-and-loop imitated this natural mechanism for seed dispersion. Close-up of a single bract spine of Arctium minus The original hook-and-loop fastener was conceived in 1941 by Swiss engineer George de Mestral. The idea came to him one day after returning from a hunting trip with his dog in the Alps. He took a close look at the burs of burdock that kept sticking to his clothes and his dog's fur. He examined them under a microscope, and noted their hundreds of \\"hooks\\" that caught on anything with a loop, such as clothing, animal fur, or hair. He saw the possibility of binding two materials reversibly in a simple fashion if he could figure out how to duplicate the hooks and loops. Hook-and-loop is viewed by some like Steven Vogel or Werner NachtigallNachtigall, W. 1974. Biological Mechanisms of Attachment: the comparative morphology and bionengineering of organs for linkage New York : Springer-Verlag as a key example of inspiration from nature or the copying of nature's mechanisms (called bionics or biomimesis). De Mestral's proposal was initially panned by industry leaders when he took his idea to Lyon, which was then a center of weaving. He did manage to gain the assistance of one weaver, who produced two cotton strips based on De Mestral's designs. However, the cotton frayed and wore out in a relatively short period of time. As a result, De Mestral began to explore the use of synthetic fibers, believing that they would provide a more resilient product. De Mestral eventually selected nylon, on the reasoning that it does not easily fray or attract mold, is non-biodegradable, and could be produced in threads of varying thickness. Nylon had only recently been invented, and through trial and error de Mestral eventually discovered that, when sewn under hot infrared light, nylon forms small hook shapes. However, he had yet to figure out a way to mechanize the process and to make the looped side. Next he found that nylon thread, when woven in loops and heat-treated, retains its shape and is resilient; however, the loops had to be cut in just the right spot so that they could be fastened and unfastened many times. On the verge of giving up, a new idea came to him. He bought a pair of shears and trimmed the tops off the loops, thus creating hooks that would match up perfectly with the loops in the pile. Mechanizing the process of weaving the hooks took eight years, and it took another year to create the loom that trimmed the loops after weaving them. In all, it took ten years to create a mechanized process that worked. De Mestral submitted his idea for a patent in Switzerland in 1951, which was granted in 1955. Within a few years he obtained patents and began to open shops in Germany, Switzerland, Great Britain, Sweden, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada. In 1957 he branched out to the textile center of Manchester, New Hampshire in the United States. Columnist Sylvia Porter made the first mention of the product in her column Your Money's Worth of August 25, 1958, writing, \\"It is with understandable enthusiasm that I give you today an exclusive report on this news: A 'zipperless zipper' has been invented ‚Äì finally. The new fastening device is in many ways potentially more revolutionary than was the zipper a quarter-century ago.\\"Sylvia Porter, \\"Your Money's Worth\\", Syracuse Herald-Journal, August 25, 1957, p21 A Montreal firm, Velek, Ltd., acquired the exclusive right to market the product in North and South America, as well as in Japan, with American Velcro, Inc. of New Hampshire, and Velcro Sales of New York, marketing the \\"zipperless zipper\\" in the United States.Id. De Mestral obtained patents in many countries right after inventing the fasteners, as he expected an immediate high demand. Partly due to its cosmetic appearance, though, hook-and-loop's integration into the textile industry took time. At the time, the fasteners looked like they had been made from leftover bits of cheap fabric, and thus was not sewn into clothing or used widely when it debuted in the early 1960s. It was also viewed as impractical. A number of Velcro Corporation products were displayed at a fashion show at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York in 1959,Suddath, Claire (June 15, 2010) A Brief History of: Velcro, Time.com, Archived at the Wayback Machine and the fabric got its first break when it was used in the aerospace industry to help astronauts maneuver in and out of bulky space suits. However, this reinforced the view among the populace that hook-and-loop was something with very limited utilitarian uses. The next major use hook-and-loop saw was with skiers, who saw the similarities between their outerwear and that of the astronauts, and thus saw the advantages of a suit that was easier to don and remove. Scuba and marine gear followed soon after. Having seen astronauts storing food pouches on walls, children's clothing makers came on board. As touch fasteners only became widely used after NASA's adoption of it, NASA is popularly ‚Äì and incorrectly ‚Äì credited with its invention. By the mid-1960s hook-and-loop fasteners were used in the futuristic creations of fashion designers such as Pierre Cardin, Andr√© Courr√®ges and Paco Rabanne. Later improvements included strengthening the filament by adding polyester. In 1978 de Mestral's patent expired, prompting a flood of low-cost imitations from Taiwan, China and South Korea onto the market. Today, the trademark is the subject of more than 300 trademark registrations in over 159 countries. George de Mestral was inducted into the USA's National Inventors Hall of Fame for his invention. The big breakthrough George de Mestral made was to think about hook-and-eye closures on a greatly reduced scale. Hook-and-eye fasteners have been common for centuries, but what was new about hook-and-loop fasteners was the miniaturisation of the hooks and eyes. Shrinking the hooks led to the two other important differences. Firstly, instead of a single-file line of hooks, touch fasteners have a two-dimensional surface. This was needed, because in decreasing the size of the hooks, the strength was also unavoidably lessened, thus requiring more hooks for the same strength. The other difference is that hook-and-loop has indeterminate match-up between the hooks and eyes. With larger hook-and-eye fasteners, each hook has its own eye. On a scale as small as that of hook-and-loop fasteners, matching up each of these hooks with the corresponding eye is impractical, thus leading to the indeterminate matching.  Strength  Hook-and-loop fastener photographed using a low power microscope. Various constructions and strengths are available. Some touch fasteners are strong enough that a two-inch square (5 √ó 5 cm) piece is enough to support a load. Fasteners made of Teflon loops, polyester hooks, and glass backing are used in aerospace applications, e.g. on space shuttles. The strength of the bond depends on how well the hooks are embedded in the loops, how much surface area is in contact with the hooks, and the nature of the force pulling it apart. If hook-and-loop is used to bond two rigid surfaces, such as auto body panels and frame, the bond is particularly strong because any force pulling the pieces apart is spread evenly across all hooks. Also, any force pushing the pieces together is disproportionately applied to engaging more hooks and loops. Vibration can cause rigid pieces to improve their bond. Full-body hook-and-loop suits have been made that can hold a person to a suitably covered wall. When one or both of the pieces is flexible, e.g., a pocket flap, the pieces can be pulled apart with a peeling action that applies the force to relatively few hooks at a time. If a flexible piece is pulled in a direction parallel to the plane of the surface, then the force is spread evenly, as it is with rigid pieces. Three ways to maximize the strength of a bond between the two flexible pieces are: * Increase the area of the bond, e.g. using larger pieces. * Ensure that the force is applied parallel to the plane of the fastener surface, such as bending around a corner or pulley. * Increase the number of hooks and loops per area unit. Shoe closures can resist a large force with only a small amount of hook-and-loop fasteners. This is because the strap is wrapped through a slot, halving the force on the bond by acting as a pulley system (thus gaining a mechanical advantage), and further absorbing some of the force in friction around the tight bend. This layout also ensures that the force is parallel to the strips.  Advantages and disadvantages  RFID transponder attached to car with touch fastener Touch fasteners are easy to use, safe, and maintenance free. There is only a minimal decline in effectiveness even after many fastenings and unfastenings. The tearing noise it makes can also be useful against pickpockets. This loud noise can also prove to be a liability, in particular on military attire such as the United States Army's Army Combat Uniform, where it can attract unwanted attention in a battlefield environment. There are also some deficiencies: it tends to accumulate hair, dust, and fur in its hooks after a few months of regular use. The loops can become elongated or broken after extended use. The hooks often become attached to articles of clothing, especially loosely woven items like sweaters. This clothing may be damaged when one attempts to remove the hook-and-loop, even if the sides are separated slowly. It also absorbs moisture and perspiration when worn next to the skin, which means it will smell if not washed. Textiles can contain chemicals or compounds, such as dyes,Crespo et al, Contact Dermatitis, 2009 that may be allergenic to sensitive people. Some products have been tested according to the Oeko-tex certification standard, which imposes limits on the chemical content of textiles to address the issue of human ecological safety. Applications Because of their ease of use, hook-and-loop fasteners have been used for a wide variety of applications where a temporary bond is required. It is especially popular in clothing where it replaces buttons or zippers, and as a shoe fastener for children who have not yet learned to tie shoelaces. Touch fasteners are used in adaptive clothing, which is designed for people with physical disabilities, the elderly, and the infirm, who may experience difficulty dressing themselves due to an inability to manipulate closures such as buttons and zippers. Hook-and-loop-fastener (USA Patent No.: US8,469,996 B2) is used in humans as a temporary fascia expander prostheses to treat the abdominal compartment syndrome and when multiple abdominal entries are necessary to control and eliminate intra-abdominal pathology. Touch fasteners held together a human heart during the first artificial heart surgery, and it is used in nuclear power plants and army tanks to hold flashlights to walls. Cars use it to bond headliners, floor mats and speaker covers. It is used in the home when pleating draperies, holding carpets in place and attaching upholstery. It closes backpacks, briefcases and notebooks, secures pockets, and holds disposable diapers, and diaper covers for cloth diapers, on babies. It is an integral part of games such as tag rugby and flag football, and is used in surfboard leashes and orthopaedic braces. NASA makes significant use of touch fasteners. Each space shuttle flew equipped with ten thousand inches of a special fastener made of Teflon loops, polyester hooks, and glass backing. Touch fasteners are widely used, from the astronauts' suits, to anchoring equipment. In the near weightless conditions in orbit, hook-and-loop fasteners are used to temporarily hold objects and keep them from floating away. A patch is used inside astronauts' helmets where it serves as a nose scratcher. During mealtimes astronauts use trays that attach to their thighs using springs and fasteners. Touch fasteners are also used aboard the International Space Station. Variations on touch fasteners 3M Dual Lock The Slidingly Engaging Fastener was developed to address several problems with common hook-and-loop fasteners. Heavy-duty variants (such as \\"Dual Lock\\" or \\"Duotec\\") feature mushroom-shaped stems on each face of the fastener, providing an audible snap when the two faces mate. A strong pressure sensitive adhesive bonds each component to its substrate. There is a silent version of touch fasteners, sometimes called Quiet Closures. Standards ASTM D5169-98 (2010) Standard Test Method for Shear Strength (Dynamic Method) of Hook and Loop Touch Fasteners * ASTM D5170-98 (2010) Standard Test Method for Peel Strength (\\"T\\" Method) of Hook and Loop Touch Fasteners * ASTM D2050-11 Standard Terminology Relating to Fasteners and Closures Used with Textiles Jumping Velcro jumping is a game where people wearing hook-covered suits take a running jump and hurl themselves as high as possible at a loop-covered wall. The wall is inflated, and looks similar to other inflatable structures. It is not necessarily completely covered in the material‚Äîoften there will be vertical strips of hooks. Sometimes, instead of a running jump, people use a small trampoline. Television show host David Letterman immortalized this during the February 28, 1984 episode of Late Night with David Letterman on NBC. Letterman proved that with enough of the material a man could be hurled against a wall and stick, by performing this feat during the television broadcast. Jumping went beyond David Letterman, with amusement companies renting walls and jumpsuits for $400-$500 a day. It was also done on a regular basis in pubs in both New York and New Zealand, where it is a competition to see how high a person can get their feet above the ground. Jeremy Bayliss and Graeme Smith of the Cri Bar and Grill in Napier, New Zealand, started it after seeing American astronauts sticking to walls during space flights. They created their own equipment for the \\"human fly\\" contests, and sold it to several others in New Zealand. The game moved to the U.S. after Sports Illustrated published a story on it in 1991. Adam Powers and Stephen Wastell of the Perfect Tommy's bar in New York city read of the game, and soon became the United States distributor of Human Bar Fly equipment. By 1992, wall- jumping was practiced in dozens of New Zealand bars and was said to be one of the favorite bar activities there at the time. In popular culture 1969-1972 - Velcro brand fasteners were used on the suits, sample collection bags, and lunar vehicles during all Apollo program missions to the Moon. * 1984 - David Letterman wears a suit made of hook-and-loop and jumps from a trampoline into a wall covered in the product during an interview with Velcro Companies' USA director of industrial sales. * 1996 - In the John Frankenheimer film The Island of Dr. Moreau, Moreau's assistant jokingly claims that the doctor won his Nobel Prize for inventing Velcro. * 1997 - The fastener has become part of a recurring joke in various media in which it is claimed that modern humans would be unable to invent it, and that it is in fact a form of advanced technology. For example, K claims in Men in Black that Velcro was originally alien technology, * 2002 - The Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"Carbon Creek\\" portrays Velcro as being introduced to human society by Vulcans in 1957. One of the Vulcans in the episode is named \\"Mestral\\", after the fastener's actual inventor and founder of the brand. * 2004 - One of the characters in the film Garden State made a vast fortune from inventing \\"silent Velcro\\". * 2016 - As an April Fool's Day joke Lexus introduced \\"Variable Load Coupling Rear Orientation (V-LCRO)\\" seats, technology that attaches the driver to the seat with Velcro Brand product to allow for more aggressive turns.

During World War II, he documented the impact of the German occupation of the Netherlands and after the war he started a press agency. Praised for portraying \\"ordinary people and small moments\\", his work appeared internationally in publications such as Time and Der Spiegel and was included in the 1955 exhibition The Family of Man; particularly notable are his photographs taken during the North Sea Flood of 1953. Biography Born in Berkhout, a small town in West Friesland, Jonker moved to Amsterdam at the age of 13. During World War II, he had a job at the Amsterdam office for resident registration and got involved with the Dutch resistance. Photographer Marie √ñstreicher (better known as Maria Austria; the Maria Austria Institute in Amsterdam is named for her) taught him the techniques of photography, and he was able to forge personal identification documents for the resistance, until he had to go into hiding in 1944. Tall and blond, on occasion he dyed his hair black and, disguised as a female nurse, took photographs of Amsterdam documenting the German occupation. These photographs were used as documentary evidence of the occupation, and to strengthen morale and raise funds for resistance activities. During this period he used the aliases Gerrit Boersma, Frans Kreder, and H√©l√®ne Annie Smitshuisen. Jonker married Austria after the war was over and for a while was a full-time photographer. With Austria and others he founded the press agency Particam (derived from Partizanen Camera) and documented the post-war reconstruction, as well as the devastation caused in Zeeland by the North Sea Flood of 1953, which killed over 1800 people in the Netherlands. Jonker arrived in Zeeland with the very first aid workers, and photographed people standing on the roofs of their homes. In 1955 his photograph of a joyfully dancing couple was selected by Edward Steichen for the exhibition and book The Family of Man. In 1959 he won second place in one of the World Press Photo of the Year categories. From 1947 to 1950, he lived and worked in Ireland, and in 1963 he met Manja van Rootselaar with whom he later on married and had a daughter with in 1964, his only child, Manja. From 1965 to 1968, he worked and lived in Spain, making patatas fritas, returning to the Netherlands to work as a photographer during periods. In 1968 he returned to his country and settled in Bentveld and worked for the studios of Harry Pot and George van de Wijngaard. For a while he lived in Wormerveer and De Wormer and, from 1971 to 1978, he worked in Cruquius, for the Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen, overseeing set design. In 1982 he divorced and moved back to Amsterdam and, after 1986, specialized in art photography. He also worked for art institutions, such as the Holland Festival, and for companies, working on calendars, books, and annual reports. His work appeared in Der Spiegel and Time, and nationally in Margriet and Algemeen Handelsblad. Legacy Jonkers was known for portraying ordinary people and street scenes, and his photographs of the reconstruction and the 1953 floods are cited as a lasting legacy. The 1998 exhibition Holland zonder haast (\\"Holland without haste\\") was dedicated to him.

Robinson wrote that \\"The monks of the present day, and all recent travellers, find the Cana of the New Testament, where Jesus converted the water into wine, at Kefr Kenna... Now as far as the prevalence of an ancient name among the common people, is any evidence for the identity of an ancient site, ‚Äî and I hold it to be the strongest of all testimony, when, as here, not subject to extraneous influences, but rather in opposition to them, ‚Äî so far is the weight of evidence in favour of this northern Kana el-Jelil, as the true site of the ancient Cana of Galilee. The name is identical, and stands the same in the Arabic version of the New Testament; while the form Kefr Kenna can only be twisted by force into a like shape\\".Biblical Researches in Palestine, 1841, p.204-208 Khirbet Qana (),PEF Names List, page 112 is an archaeological site in the Lower Galilee of Israel. It has remains of a settlement from the Hellenistic to the Early Arab period. It has been associated with the Marriage at Cana of the New Testament. Biblical Cana Khirbet Qana (grid: 178/247) is one of the locations in Galilee that researchers consider as a possibility for the biblical town of Cana, where Jesus turned water into wine at the Wedding at Cana.Schuler, Mark \\"Recent archaeology of Galilee and the interpretation of texts from the Galilean Ministry of Jesus\\", Corcordia Theological Quarterly,2007 Crusader maps have been cited as evidence identifying Khirbet Qana with the biblical Cana. The writings of Burchard of Mount Sion have also linked Khirbet Qana with Cana.Richardson, Peter. \\"Khirbet Qana (and Other Villages) as a Context for Jesus\\", Jesus and Archaeology ed. James H. Charlesworth. William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2006. pg 120-144 By the medieval period, texts from Christian pilgrims reveal Khirbet Qana was associated with the biblical Cana during that period,Edwards,Douglas R. \\"Khirbet Qana: from Jewish Village to Christian Pilgrimage site\\", The Roman and Byzantine Near East, vol 3. Portsmouth, R.I.: Journal of Roman Archaeology, ed. Humphrey, John H. 2002. pg 101-132 including the account of the English merchant Saewulf in the 12th century.Janin, Hunt Four Paths to Jerusalem: Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Secular Pilgrimages, 1000 BCE to 2001 CE, McFarland & Company, Inc. Publishers, 2004. pg 95-97 In the 17th century, Francisco Quaresimus concluded that Kafr Kanna was the biblical Cana, as it had a church, while Khirbet Qana did not. However, the fact that the main road from Sepphoris to Tiberias passed Kafr Kanna rather than Khirbet Qana, may have been a factor in this decision. Historical geographer, Samuel Klein, also thought that the ancient Cana was to be identified with the Arab village of Kafr Kanna, but that the nearby ruin of Khirbet Qana (which bears the same name) was actually a different village, which Klein thought to be Kefar 'Aris (Heb. ◊õ◊ë◊® ◊¢◊®◊ô◊°) mentioned in the Tosefta (Kelim Baba-Metsia 11:2), and said to be mentioned by Josephus in The Jewish War under the name Garis, a town situated not far from Sepphoris.Josephus, The Jewish War (3.127 and 5:473; and in Vita ¬ß71) The Greek word used in this toponym is , the Gamma said to be of the same ancient usage as found in Greek transcriptions of Gaza = ◊¢◊ñ◊î and Gabara = ◊¢◊®◊ë.Samuel Klein, (1930). \\"On Topography\\" (◊ú◊ò◊ï◊§◊ï◊í◊®◊§◊ô◊î), in: Tarbi·∫ï (1930), Jerusalem, pp. 127‚Äì131 (Hebrew) The ruin is situated about east of Sepphoris. Today, scholars are again focusing on Khirbet Qana as the site for the biblical Cana. Description of excavation site Khirbet Qana is located on a 100-meter hill, on the north side of Beth Netofa valley. Excavations have shown that Khirbet Qana was used as a settlement from the Hellenistic to the Erly Arab period, with housing in use from the Hellenistic period through the Byzantine period. Khirbet Qana was a densely populated, but small, rural village that relied mainly on agriculture.Richardson, Peter \\"What has Cana to do with Capernaum?\\"New Testament Studies 48, no. 3, 2002 pg 314-331 Excavations at Khirbet Qana have revealed that the unwalled city was partially built into the area‚Äôs hillsides, resulting in terraced houses on the hill, with larger houses arranged around a courtyard in the flatter areas. Researchers have identified 3 types of houses at Khirbet Qana; terraced housing, side courtyard houses, and central courtyard houses. Terraced houses were located on the steep eastern and western slopes of the hill, while side courtyard houses were located in the flatter area to the north. Courtyard houses were located in the flattest areas of the village, on the hilltop, and featured large central courtyards. In addition to residential housing, Khirbet Qana includes a Jewish synagogue, a later Byzantine complex (possibly a ‚Äúveneration cave‚Äù), and a series of tombs. There is also some evidence of a monumental building of some kind on the hilltop, perhaps a synagogue, at which a fragment of fresco was found during the excavations of the site. Christianity In addition to the Jewish synagogue, there is evidence of a Christian place of worship in the form of a ‚Äúveneration cave‚Äù which is a series of four connected caves. The main cave has plaster walls and floors, which include graffiti and inscriptions, of which some are Christian. The main cave also features benches along the walls, and a possible altar on the north side of the cave, which is partially formed by a sarcophagus lid that features at least one cross. Plastered in place atop the sarcophagus lid were at least two stone vessels, with one still in situ, while the imprint of the second vessel remains in the plaster. Carbon dating from inside the caves associated with Christian worship have revealed that the main cave underwent renovation during the period of the Crusades- a bench was added to the west side of the cave, the floor was plastered, and the walls were re-plastered. This period, which carbon dating dates from 1024-1217 would have been the last phase of considerable use. The altar or table made of the sarcophagus lid with the two stone vessels on its top, along with the carbon dating which places the major renovations at the time of the Crusaders, provide some evidence that the cave complex may have been used as a reliquary to celebrate Jesus‚Äôs turning of water into wine. Artifacts Both coins and pottery shards have been found in the excavations of Khirbet Qana. The coins found at Khirbet Qana are Hasmonean. One particular pottery shard found at the site, a fragment of a cooking pot, proved to be an ostracon in Aramaic, which is considered to be the language spoken in the region of Galilee at the time of Jesus.Eshel, Esther & Douglas R. Edwards, \\"Language and writing in early Roman Galilee: social location of a potter‚Äôs abcedary from Khirbet Qana\\", in Religion and Society in Roman Palestine: old questions, new approaches New York: Routledge. 2004. pg 49-55 Industry Industrial buildings were found on the outskirts of the town, including facilities for breeding doves, olive presses, fabric dying, and glass making. Over 60 cisterns for water storage have been found throughout the excavation site as well. Pottery found at Khirbet Qana from nearby Shikhin and Kefar Hananya show that trade at Khirbet Kana would have been largely local or regional. Fields for cultivation on the west side of Khirbet Qana, along with tax records detailing taxes on crops from the 16th century serve as evidence that Khirbet Qana relied in part on agriculture. Inhabitants The excavations of both a Jewish Synagogue and a Christian place of pilgrimage and worship reveal that Khirbet Qana was an important location for both religious groups, with a population of primarily Jewish inhabitants in earlier periods, such as the Roman and Hellenistic periods. Coins found at the site serve as evidence that the Khirbet Qana was under Maccabean influence by the 1st century BC, though at this time no Maccabean buildings have been found at the site. During the period of the Crusades, Christian pilgrims visited Khirbet Qana, though it is unclear if they ever lived there. In later years A lack of coinage from the late 4th to early 5th centuries may indicate a decline in Khirbet Qana, but the town shows signs of expansion and growth during the Late Byzantine period (late 5th to 7th centuries). The latest date for a coin found at Khirbet Qana is 613, and it was likely abandoned during the first half of the 7th century, during which time Galilee underwent invasion (614) and re- conquest (628) from Persia, prior to the Arab conquest (639). The acropolis at Khirbet Qana, however, was again occupied most likely from the late 7th century through the early 8th century, as evidenced by Arab pottery found across the area, as well as renovations to the public building on the acropolis, and an early Islamic fragment of pottery.

A distinguished officer, he is also notable for his participation in resistance groups against the Greek military junta of 1967‚Äì74, being repeatedly imprisoned and exiled as a consequence.  Life  Born in Athens on 21 May 1932, Leonidas Vasilikopoulos entered the Hellenic Navy Academy on 7 October 1949 and graduated on 18 June 1954 as a Line Ensign. Promoted to sub- lieutenant on 4 June 1957, he received his first command, the vehicle carrier Merlin, in 1961. On 16 October 1961, he was promoted to lieutenant. In 1962, he received command of the vehicle carriers Daniolos and Grigoropoulos (1962‚Äì63). On 19 August 1966, he voluntarily retired with the rank of lieutenant in retirement. The reason for his early retirement was his persistence in marrying Nota Iliopoulou, daughter of Stavros Iliopoulos, an MP of the United Democratic Left, successor of the banned Communist Party. Vasilikopoulos had repeatedly been trying to get the service's permission to marry her since October 1963, but in vain. He even brought the case to the Council of State, which found in his favour on 27 November 1965, but his insistence was received with disfavour in the Navy leadership: on 5 January 1966, he was informed that he would not be promoted, as his \\"feuding with the service\\" placed his \\"loyalty to the legitimate authorities\\" in doubt, and by March he received an unfavourable transfer and was restricted to unimportant duties. During the Greek military junta of 1967‚Äì74, he was an active opponent of the military regime, and was imprisoned and tortured by the Greek Military Police (EAT-ESA). Thus he was arrested by EAT-ESA on 2 August 1969 and held for a month in prison for his participation in the anti-junta Filiki Etaireia group. He was then placed in isolated custody in a hotel until 21 April 1970, and then sent to internal exile at Samothrace until 8 April 1971. Shortly after his release, on 23 September, he was re-arrested for his participation in another anti-junta group, Free Greeks, and held in the Korydallos Prison until 14 July 1972. He was re-arrested on 21 May 1973 for his participation in the Antidictatorial Youth-EAN group, and condemned to 2.5 years in prison, but released in the general amnesty of 21 August. On 5 April 1974, the junta removed Vasilikopoulos from the naval reserve list for anti-regime and \\"anti- national\\" acts. Following the re-establishment of democracy in August 1974, on 3 December this act was reversed, and on 24 February 1975 he was recalled to active service with his old rank of lieutenant. On 14 August 1976, he was declared as having never been removed from service, and was retroactively promoted to the ranks of lieutenant commander (dated 13 October 1966) and commander (29 June 1970). In 1975‚Äì76 he again commanded the Daniolos, followed by command of the destroyer Leon, studies at the Naval War School (1976), and command of the 3rd Destroyer Squadron (1977). On 21 June 1977, he was promoted to captain. In 1977‚Äì78 Vasilikopoulos commanded the destroyer . In 1979‚Äì80 he served as a staff officer in NATO's COMEDCENT. In 1980‚Äì81 he attended the NATO Defence School and the Greek National Defence Academy. In 1981‚Äì82 he served as head of Mine Warfare Command. He was then posted head of the Second Branch (Personnel) of the Hellenic Navy General Staff (1982‚Äì84). He was promoted to Commodore on 17 March 1982 (retroactive to 5 January). On 20 December 1984, he was promoted to rear admiral, and was posted head of the Naval Training Command (1984‚Äì86). Promoted to vice admiral on 20 January 1986, he assumed the Fleet Command, before being appointed Chief of the Navy General Staff on 22 December 1986. He held the post until his retirement on 17 July 1989, when he was given the final rank of full admiral in retirement. Concurrently, he was also head of NATO's COMEDEAST. The chief event of his tenure, was the Greco- Turkish crisis in March 1987, which he handled very successfully. In October 1993, he was appointed as head of the National Intelligence Service by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, a post he held until dismissed following the Imia crisis with Turkey in early 1996. During the latter crisis, the Greek government's handling of the situation was hampered by the intense distrust shown by the newly appointed Prime Minister, Kostas Simitis, towards the incumbent military and intelligence chiefs, Vasilikopoulos among them. Admiral Vasilikopoulos died on 30 May 2014.

Natural ADEPs were originally found as products of aerobic fermentation in Streptomyces hawaiiensis, A54556A and B,K. H. Michel, R. E. Kastner (Eli Lilly and Company), US 4492650, 1985 [Chem. Abstr. 1985, 102, 130459]. and in the culture broth of Streptomyces species, enopeptin A and B. ADEPs are of great interest in drug development due to their antibiotic properties and thus are being modified in attempt to achieve greater antimicrobial activity. The potential role of ADEPs in combating antibiotic drug resistance is postulated due to their novel mode of action that other antibiotics are not known to use, activation of casein lytic protease (ClpP) which is an important bacterial protease. Most antibiotics work through inhibitory processes to establish cell death, while ADEPs actually work through activation of the protease to cause uncontrolled protein degradation, inhibition of cell division, and subsequent cell death. They largely affect Gram-positive bacteria and could be of great use to target antibiotic resistant microbes such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and others. Despite the potential use of ADEP, possible resistance has been examined in certain species. __TOC__ Mechanism 1\\\\. ClpP cannot degrade protein chains longer than 5 peptides because they are bigger than its proteolytic channel. 2. ClpP requires an ATPase to unfold big proteins, allowing them to pass through ClpP's channel. 3. When ADEPs bind to ClpP, the ATPase/ClpP complex dissociate. 4. The proteolytic channel of ClpP becomes large enough to degrade the proteins without the help of any ATPase. ADEP antibiotics can be used to defeat resistant bacterial infections. They bind to ClpP and allow the protease to degrade proteins without the help of an ATPase. ADEP4/ClpP complexes target primarily newly formed proteins, and FtsZ which allows cell division. ClpP active form is a tetradecamer composed of two heptamers to which 14 ADEPs bind to. 14 ADEPs bind to ClpP leading to changes in its structure. ClpP's proteolytic channel goes from a closed to an open and unregulated state. 1.Top View 2. Side View ADEPs bind in the cavities formed by two ClpP monomers. Their binding site is composed of hydrophobic residues and corresponds to the binding sites of ClpP ATPases. Upon binding, a series of secondary structures shifts occur from the outer region to the center of ClpP. This puts the flexible N-terminal Œ≤-loop, into a disordered state. The Œ≤-loops normally form a gate above the proteolytic channel and prevent proteins from randomly passing through. They are critical for ClpP interaction with its substrate and ATPases. When ADEP binds, the Œ≤-loops shift outward and this is accompanied by the shifts of two Œ±-helices (Œ±1 and Œ±2), four Œ≤-strands (Œ≤1, Œ≤2, Œ≤3 and Œ≤5) and other loops which lead to the opening of the ClpP pore. In summary, ADEP4 deregulates ClpP function and changes it from a closed state to an open one. At this point its specific proteolytic activity becomes a less controlled process, with the destruction of proteins that are around in the targeted cell. The peptidase ClpP is highly conserved throughout organisms and is tightly regulated. Without activation, ClpP in normal conditions can degrade short peptides that freely diffuse into its inner degradation chamber. Clp-family proteins are ATP-dependent proteases which play a crucial role in the cell function by degrading misfolded proteins. ClpP is a monomer on its own but oligomerizes into tetradecamers when bound to ATPases. Accessed 2016-04-06. It needs an ATPase to identify, unfold, and transfer targeted big proteins into its proteolytic channel. In fact, ClpP on its own can only degrade peptides that are up to six amino acids long. ADEP binding induces ClpP proteolytic activation that leads to the proteins degradation in the cell, especially nascent proteins and the Ftsz protein which is an important protein in cell division. This potentially leads to cell death and is the reason why ADEP is a promising technique for drug development. For folded proteins, unfolded proteins, and long peptides, ClpP must be activated by a protein in the family of ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA proteins), such as ClpA, ClpX, or ClpC. These chaperone proteins are responsible for hydrolyzing ATP to ADP, harnessing the energy, and then taking folded proteins and unfolding them. Next, Clp-ATPases slip the unfolded proteins into the degradation chamber within ClpP, allowing for processive degradation of the substrate. This process is tightly regulated with the hydrolysis of ATP to prevent uncontrolled protein or peptide degradation that would be harmful to the cell. In contrast, ADEP activates ClpP without the need for ATP hydrolysis, causing degradation of unfolded proteins and peptides within the cell at uncontrolled rates. ADEPs are thought to bind slightly cooperatively on the surface of each ClpP ring in its hydrophobic pockets and have allosteric effects in activation of ClpP. This binding initiates ClpP to undergo a conformational change such that its N-terminal region opens up its axial pore to allow for partial degradation of products, as compared to progressive degradation with ClpA. ADEP activation of ClpP does not allow for folded protein degradation, but even with unfolded protein and peptide degradation, ADEP still causes bacterial cell death. Research has shown that ADEP-activated ClpP targets cell division rather than metabolic processes. ADEP appears to initiate ClpP to preferably degrade FtsZ, an important bacterial protein involved in septum formation that is necessary for bacterial cell division. As a result, Gram-positive bacteria treated with ADEPs form long filaments before cell death.  Advantages  When bacteria are exposed to antibiotics they can become resistant or tolerant to the antibiotic. ADEPs have a great potential for clinical application due to their high antibacterial activity against Gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, and other pathogens that are found in biofilms and chronic infections. Their effectiveness increases when combined with different antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, linezolid, vancomycin or rifampicin. Additional studies should focus more on the toxicity of ADEPs and their implementation for clinical use.  Applications  After the dysregulation of bacterial proteolytic machinery by a new class of antibiotics was published in the Journal Nature, many scientists started to study this antibiotic. Most of the experiments are focused on how the ADEPs/ClpP complex work, and the functional difference between ADEP and its synthetic congeners. In 2011, P. Sass and co-workers performed a research focusing in the interaction and function of ADEPs and ClpP. They induced ADEP into Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae to identify how ADEP leads to the death of bacteria. The results demonstrated that ADEP is perturbing bacterial cell division. To identify the reason why ADEP inhibited cell division, researchers monitored septum formation and nucleoid segregation in ADEP B. subtilis and ADEP S. aureus. The S. aureus and B. subtilis samples gave equivalent results. This part showed the importance of wild type of ClpP and inhibition of septum formation is by direct interference of ADEP with the cell division components. Localization studies by GFP-labeled cell divisions proteins demonstrated that ADEP causes delocalization of Ftsz and inhibition of Z-Ring assembly in both species. The impact of ADEP in ‚àÜclpX mutant indicated that ADEP is affecting cell division and that it also inhibits Z-ring assembly. Finally researchers repeat the experiment with ‚àÜClpP mutant to confirm that the presence of ADEP decreases abundance of FtsZ through ClpP degradation. In 2013, scientists at Northeastern University performed an experiment focused on how ADEP 4/ClpP works. The experimental results showed the efficiency of ADEP4 when it is combined with other antibiotics. Researchers monitored the amount of trypic peptides, and found out that ADEP4/ClpP induces peptide degradation in a biofilm system. By using Mueller-Hinton broth they demonstrated that ADEP 4 was more effective than other antibiotics such as rifampicin or vancomycin. However, they observed the same trends where ADEP4 combined to rifampicin is more effective and actually eradicates all stationary phases. The in vitro results showed the efficiency of ADEP 4 in mice infected with 4 different strains S. aureus, the laboratory strain SA113, and clinical isolates USA300, UAMS-1 and strain 37.  Chemistry  ADEPs are naturally occurring antibiotics. Certain bacteria produce them as defense mechanism in antagonist bacterial interactions. For instance, Streptomyces species produce them as secondary metabolites. ADEP 1 and its synthetic congeners There are 6 forms of acyl depsipeptides that are distinguishable by their chemical structure and function. ADEPs generally differ by one or two functional groups that give some of them more flexibility, and stability. Their chemical structures are derived from ADEP 1 and are slightly different from one another. For instance, the only difference between ADEP 2 and ADEP 3 is the conformation of the difluorophenylalanine side chain. ADEP 2 has an S configuarion while ADEP 3 has an R configuarion. =Molecular modification= In order to develop a useful antibiotic, ADEP continues to be modified for greater antimicrobial activity and stability. By restricting components of ADEP to decrease the molecule's flexibility, binding was enhanced and antimicrobial activity significantly increased. Specific amino acids essential to the peptidolactone core of ADEP were altered and restricted, causing stabilization of ADEP in a bioactive conformation. In fact, the conformational restrictions of ADEP resulted in its ability to activate ClpP increasing seven-fold and its antimicrobial activity 1200-fold. Research on altering ADEP molecules continues in attempt to construct a new antibiotic for public use.

It was released on October 4, 2011 on Bar/None Records, and marks Emperor X's debut release for that label. Background and promotion Matheny said Western Teleport's title was influenced by his \\"obsession\\" over technological advancements while he was living in California. He also described it as \\"a dark record from my average kind of record,\\" adding that \\"It's coming out of a pretty dark, exploratory, sweaty, breathless place in my life.\\" To promote the album, Bar/None, with the help of the Alternative Distribution Alliance, buried 41 \\"nodes\\" at different random locations throughout North America. The nodes contain a cassette with either B-sides or early versions of songs on Western Teleport. Matheny has credited his inspiration for the idea of burying cassettes for others to find when he became concerned about the environmental impact of making multiple copies of the same album. Still, he wanted to preserve the organizational structure of an album. He later concluded that the best way to ensure that the physical musical recording had its own worth while also ensuring the music would be heard was to make just one copy of each song. After NPR interviewed Matheny about this project in 2010, he caught the attention of Bar/None Records, which released the album the following year. The album's opening track, \\"Erica Western Teleport,\\" has been described as \\"... a model example of the bummer jam template.\\" Many people have also described the song as being relatable with regard to their own lives. Reception The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics, and was ranked as one of the 10 most underrated albums of 2011 by Salon. Dan Weiss, one such critic, compared Emperor X to They Might Be Giants because of their shared penchant for catchy songs and nerdy subject matter.

An S corporation is a closely held corporation that makes a valid election to be taxed under Subchapter S of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code so that the corporation does not pay federal taxes, instead passing on all income, losses, and credits to the shareholders who pay the taxes. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background The S corporation tax credit expired at the end of 2013. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Permanent S Corporation Built-in Gains Recognition Period Act of 2014 would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce from 10 to 5 years the period during which the built-in gains of an S corporation are subject to tax and to make such reduction permanent. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means on April 29, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4453 would amend the Internal Revenue Code to make permanent a five-year recognition period for built-in gains of S corporations, retroactive to January 1, 2014. Under current law, a corporation that meets certain requirements may elect to be taxed as an S corporation, which generally pays no corporate-level tax, unlike a C corporation. For corporations that convert from C corporations to S corporations, or S corporations that receive assets under certain conditions from C corporations, there is a corporate-level tax on certain built-in gains of certain assets, with a 10-year recognition period under current law. This legislation makes permanent the five-year recognition period for S corporation built-in gains that was generally in effect for taxable years from 2011 through 2013. The legislation also applies to regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts. The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that enacting H.R. 4453 would reduce revenues, thus increasing federal deficits, by $1.5 billion over the 2014-2024 period. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending and revenues. Enacting H.R. 4453 would result in revenue losses in each year beginning in 2015. JCT has determined that the bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Permanent S Corporation Built-in Gains Recognition Period Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on April 10, 2014 by Rep. David G. Reichert (R, WA-8). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Ways and Means. It was reported (amended) by the committee on May 2, 2014 alongside House Report 113-429. The bill was scheduled to be considered on the House floor on June 10, 2014. Debate and discussion The Subchapter S Bank Association supported the bill because the organization \\"supports making the five-year recognition period for built in gains permanent.\\" Jim Redpath argued that a shorter period would be better because \\"ten years is a long time and certainly not cognizant of current business-planning cycles. Many times I have experienced changes in the business environment or the economy which prompted S corporations to need access to their own capital, that if taken would trigger this prohibitive tax. This results in business owners not making the appropriate decision for the business and its stakeholders simply because of the BIG tax.\\" See alsoList of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External linksLibrary of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4453 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 4453 *GovTrack.us H.R. 4453 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 4453 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4453 *Congressional Budget Office Report on H.R. 4453 Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Taxation in the United States ","title":"Permanent S Corporation Built-in Gains Recognition Period Act of 2014"},{"id":"42911711","text":"Devendra Sharma (born 20 March 1953) is a former Indian cricket umpire.

Each participant in Talkomatic has their own section of the screen, broadcasting messages letter-by-letter as they are typed. This interaction is dissimilar from present-day chat systems and is based upon work done in 1973 at the University of Illinois on the PLATO system by Doug Brown and David R. Woolley. This work is part of a conservation effort aimed at preserving historically significant works and their descendants. The original Talkomatic can be seen operating as it did in the 1970s on the CYBIS system operated by cyber1.org.  History  The original Talkomatic was the first multi-user online chat system, with the possible exception of the Party Line function of the Emergency Management Information Systems And Reference Index (EMISARI) system, created for the US Office of Emergency Preparedness by Murray Turoff in 1971. Talkomatic was created by Doug Brown and David R. Woolley in 1973 on the PLATO System at the University of Illinois. It offered six channels (the analog of a 'room'), each of which could hold up to five participants. Along with PLATO Notes and a wide variety of games, Talkomatic was one of the features of PLATO that gave rise to a large online community that persisted into the mid 1980s. Ray Ozzie's smartphone app, Talko, (launched in September 2014 and was acquired, and dissolved by Microsoft in 2016) is named after Talkomatic, which Ozzie experienced while working on the PLATO System in the 1970s.  Web version  On March 11, 2014, Brown and Woolley released a new version of Talkomatic designed for the web. Intended to be a reinterpretation of its 1970s namesake, it is conceptually similar to the original system, but limitations imposed by the resource constraints of the time (such as the maximum room count) have been lifted. = Revival of original concepts = Features of the original work included Public, Private and Semi-private spaces which enabled five concurrent 'chatters' to communicate in accordance with their privacy needs. By the end of 2017, Talkomatic was in its third version and supported the original's features of Public and Private rooms but work on the final feature, Semi-Private rooms had not been implemented. On March 11, 2018, Version 4 was released, completing the features of the original version with some enhancements in support of the greater variety of modern-day browsers and display resolutions. With this final addition, a feature was added to address the problems arising from truly anonymous access. = Enabling anonymity = The original Talkomatic evolved in the PLATO community which was largely limited by the constraints of requiring credentials used to access the PLATO system. The system recognized different types of users: authors, instructors, students and multiples. These users were managed as \\"groups\\" and the owners of those groups provided the administrative oversight necessary if user conduct was deemed inappropriate by others. At the discretion of a group owner, credentials could be suspended or revoked entirely. The most anonymous of the credential types, multiples, could be prevented from accessing the Talkomatic system, thus preventing any type of anonymous access. Talkomatic (Web version) was designed to be freely available for use by anyone but complete anonymity invited abuse. The Version 4 solution was to implement an in-room voting system for rooms holding three or more participants. Participants who deemed the conduct of another to be inappropriate could \\"vote-down\\" the offending user. If a participant's conduct is deemed inappropriate by more than half of the participants, the offending participant is ejected from the room. In addition to Brown and Woolley's original domain (talko.cc), Ray Ozzie donated three other domains to the conservation efforts. In 2018, Talkomatic is now available at: talko.cc, talkomatic.com, talkomatic.org, and talkomatic.net.

The film traces the history of Formula One auto racing from its early years, in which some seasons had multiple fatalities, to the 1994 death of Ayrton Senna, the sport's most recent death at the time of production. Extensive and often rare archival footage is used throughout. Synopsis The film opens with the 1996 Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne, where Martin Brundle survived a spectacular crash at turn 3. After receiving clearance from race doctor Sid Watkins, Brundle hopped into a spare car to finish the race. The film then takes a brief look at the early days of Formula One racing in the 1950s, which was essentially a resumption of prewar Grand Prix racing. In 1958, the year world champion Juan Manuel Fangio retired, the FIA announced the Formula One World Constructors' Championship for the makers of the winning car. This led to a wave of British privateer teams, nicknamed \\"Garagistas\\" by Enzo Ferrari, dominating the Championship. Most notable was Team Lotus, led by Colin Chapman.Chapman's innovative designs and the talent of Jim Clark saw the team becoming influential in the evolving Formula One development. In 1966, the FIA doubled the engine size from 1.5 to 3 liters, which saw the cars race markedly faster on tracks and facilities unchanged since before World War II. This resulted in several fatal accidents. The death of Chapman's star driver Jim Clark at the Hockenheimring in a Formula Two race in 1968 was a turning point: several drivers, including Clark's Lotus replacement, Jochen Rindt, and the Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA), began questioning the sport's safety. Rindt himself was killed during practice at the 1970 Italian Grand Prix; he was posthumously awarded the driver's championship that year. Jackie Stewart, three-time champion and Chairman of the GPDA, used his position to push for improved safety and track facilities, including safety barriers and mandatory seat belts. This caused some opposition with other drivers, most notably Jacky Ickx, Stewart's opponent on the track at the time. Stewart's influence led to boycotts of some races, including the 1971 Belgian Grand Prix. Despite his efforts, drivers continued to be killed, including Stewart's own teammate, Fran√ßois Cevert, at the 1973 United States Grand Prix. Meanwhile, new drivers and teams made their way into Formula One. Hesketh Racing, led by the extravagant Lord Hesketh, entered Formula One in 1973 with their Formula Two driver James Hunt. Despite their rather blas√© appearance, they performed surprisingly well including winning the 1975 Dutch Grand Prix ahead of Ferrari's Niki Lauda. When Hesketh was forced to close at the end of 1975, Hunt went to McLaren, which placed both him and Lauda as favorites to win the 1976 Championship.The 1976 season was dramatic, for Lauda led for the first half, but Hunt gained ground on Lauda despite being disqualified from two races (the Spanish Grand Prix victory was later reinstated). Lauda almost died from a fiery accident at the German Grand Prix at the notorious N√ºrburgring, but managed to keep his championship alive by taking fourth at the Italian Grand Prix almost a month after his accident. At the last race at a rain- soaked Japanese Grand Prix, Lauda voluntarily retired from the race, allowing Hunt to win the championship by finishing third. In 1978, Bernie Ecclestone, head of the Formula One Constructors Association, hired Professor Sid Watkins as the official Formula One 'race doctor.' Initially distrusted by track officials, Watkins' influence on the sport increased after the death of Ronnie Peterson at the 1978 Italian Grand Prix; at that race, the Italian officials prevented him from treating Peterson at the scene.Watkins was later named President of a Formula One Medical Commission in 1981, which implemented permanent on-track medical facilities amongst other medical advancements. Following Peterson's accident, Formula One remained relatively fatality free until the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, which saw the deaths of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna in separate accidents. In the aftermath, the FIA President Max Mosley (who drove in the race Jim Clark was killed in, and was head of March Engineering in the 1970s), formed the Advisory Expert Group chaired by Sid Watkins to research and improve safety in motor racing.

The majority of the interviews were completed in 2010 and 2011. Release The documentary premiered on January 10, 2014 at the Empire, Leicester Square in London, United Kingdom. The sport suffered its first fatality in 2015 as a result of a 2014 accident when Jules Bianchi died on July 17, 2015. =Home media= 1 was released on DVD and Blu- ray on January 28, 2014 in the United States and Canada and on March 17 in the United Kingdom. The Australian Blu-ray release and some DVDs are bundled with Rush. Critical reception Mike McCahill of The Guardian gave the documentary 4 stars out of 5, stating, \\"This F1 history finds its narrative impetus in the trade-off between crowd pleasing speed and concern for driver survival\\". McCahill praised the timing and contextual presentation, and described the film as \\"surprisingly critical.\\" Mark Kermode of The Guardian found \\"gripping\\" the mixture of archive footage and modern-day interviews. Daniel Johnson of The Telegraph considered the film a \\"compelling\\" depiction, noting that Formula One racing went beyond \\"sport\\" to \\"high-stakes theatre\\" in the fifteen years following 1967, a period in which 19 drivers died. Charlotte O'Sullivan of the London Evening Standard described the movie as \\"pure bliss for Formula 1 fans.\\" The film's star power was highlighted by Ian Freer of Empire. The Independent described the film as \\"well-researched\\", but noted its \\"morbid\\" and \\"depressing\\" elements. Bleacher Report featured columnist Matthew Walthert described the film as an inspiring tragedy told by the living about those who died while quickly driving high-powered and potentially lethal \\"mobile bombs.\\" The Independent notes the film graphically documents the improvement of safety in the sport. Fassbender's narration was described as both \\"sonorous\\" and \\"laconic\\". Ecclestone and Mosley were lauded by reviewers for their \\"genuine determination\\" and for their roles as \\"self-styled guardian angels\\". Kermode noted the timing of the film, which opened in the shadow of Senna (2010) and Rush (2013). The film is praised for complementing them both. The Independent described the film as produced alongside Rush. Walthert claimed the film was a response to Senna, which \\"raised the bar for F1 filmmaking\\" as much as its predecessor. The archival footage is said to be familiar to viewers of those films, but it is said to be \\"moving\\" and \\"smartly marshalled\\". British GQ critic Rebecca Cox described the footage as \\"100 per cent real and utterly terrifying\\".

She also appeared in the arcade game Lord of Vermilion III. Zero is an Intoner, one of six god-like beings who control magic through their singing abilities. In trying to destroy the flower that gave birth to her powers and tried to use her to destroy humanity, she sets out to kill the five other Intoners spawned from her body by the flower to carry out its mission, referred to as her sisters. Zero was created by Taro Yoko, the game's director and co-writer, and designed by Kimihiko Fujisaka. Yoko wanted an unusual type of protagonist that had not been featured very often in games. Fujisaka crafted her to emulate the dark tones of the series, although he also added features to create a feminine vibe, such as the flower in her eye. Despite being criticized for her characterization and personality, she has also been praised for her interactions with the other characters and for standing out among video game protagonists. Fans of the Drakengard series in Japan have also received her positively. Creation and design Zero was conceived by Taro Yoko, the director and co-writer of Drakengard 3. While conceiving her, Yoko thought it would be interesting to do a character who had worked in a brothel, as the concept had not been often explored and the Drakengard series offered an opportunity for such a protagonist to be created. This sexual aspect of the character was generally conveyed through dialogue rather than cutscenes. One of the earlier ideas for Zero's role in the game was to have her as a schoolgirl with a cellphone in a contemporary setting, but this was quickly decided against. Eventually, Yoko decided to create more female characters for Zero to interact with: one of the reasons behind this was that all other possible choices for the game had been rejected. Her number-based name, along with the names of all her sisters, were meant to make it easier for players to identify and distinguish them. Yoko helped write her dialogue to complement the game's unusual situations, such as rude conversations between her and the disciples during moments of carnage. Multiple aspects of Zero's character and worldview were incorporated into the game's theme song \\"This Silence is Mine\\" by composers Keiichi Okabe and Onitsuka Chihiro. The choice of Zero's voice actress was an important part of her design, as the team wanted to both have a good performance and surprise the audience: Maaya Uchida, normally known for gentler female roles in anime and video games, was chosen for the role. Zero was designed by Kimihiko Fujisaka, a designer who had worked on each entry in the Drakengard series. His original design was meant to emulate her status as a god-like being, and have a more elaborate and heroic appearance, but as the game's atmosphere was finalized, Fujisaka redesigned her with some unaesthetic elements, taking direct influence from the game atmosphere: this was the main reason behind adding her prosthetic arm. The original creation of the arm was a pure accident on Fujisaka's part. Her color palette was intended as a reverse of Caim, the protagonist of Drakengard. Other aspects of her design evoked the color and design for the Goddess of the Seal, a key character in the earlier Drakengard games. She went through two redesigns before Yoko was satisfied. Her final design, along with the flower in her eye, emphasized her sexuality. She originally had no flower in her design, but Fujisaka wanted to add an aspect of femininity to her appearance. The decision to place it in her eye was to add originality to the character: while the game's producer Takamata Shiba originally feared it was too much of a risk in conjunction with her gender, Yoko approved of the design. After Zero was finalized, Yoko decided on more female characters, and told Fujisaka to \\"think Puella Magi Madoka Magica\\" while designing them. Elements of her design were incorporated into the other Intoners. Her design, along with the rest of the main characters, was inspired by modern clothing styles and fashion in contrast to the \\"medieval\\" inspiration of previous games. Fictional biography In Zero's prequel novella, \\"A Rain to End and a Flower to Begin\\", it is revealed that Zero was abused by her mother and sold into prostitution. Eventually escaping, she grew to live by killing and stealing, with the killing eventually becoming an unconscious instinct. Eventually, she was weakened by a deadly disease and was caught and imprisoned, dying from her illness there. Upon dying, she was revived and turned into an IntonerIntoners: in the Japanese version by a magical flower intent on destroying mankind. Learning the flower's plans for her, Zero tried to kill herself, but the flower kept her alive, and spawned five other Intoners as a safety measure: these Intoners were Zero's \\"sisters\\". The sisters eventually took control of the land from the native warlords. Eventually, Zero decides to kill her sisters, then herself to rid the world of the flower.Zero: The first time I saw this flower... was the day I died. Now I'm just a corpse being kept alive by the flower's magic. [...] This flower is a calamity that threatens the entire world. It's growing, feeding off me. Eventually it's going to consume me entirely, and once that happens? Once it's fully grown? It's going to destroy everything. [...] When I realized that I was infected with a flower that was going to end the world, I tried to kill myself. Well, technically I was already dead, but, yeah. Anyway, I tried to rip the damn thing out. But, in the end, I just made things worse. The flower freaked out. Started sprouting these... children. Five little girls, one after another. They burst out of me and ran off before I could blink. [...] But you wanna know the best part? After a while, my \\"sisters\\" started fighting for peace. They come from a flower that's gonna end the world, and they fight for PEACE? ..Hilarious. Anyway, I made my choice. I decided to kill my sisters, and then destroy the flower. (Branch D, Verse 7) In the prequel manga Drag-On Dragoon 3: Utahime Five, told from the point of view of the other Intoners, it is revealed that she is directly responsible for the creation of the Disciples, used by her in an attempt to destroy the Intoners. By the events of Drakengard 3, Zero had forged a partnership with the dragon Michael: as dragons are the only beings that can destroy Intoners, Michael would help Zero kill her sisters, then kill her to finish off the flower.One: Intoners offer only pestilence to this world. Someday, they will be the disease that brings ruin to all human life. That's why you're trying to kill us: to save the world. And once you succeed in killing your sisters... You're going to finish the job... and kill yourself. And you'll use that dragon to do it. (Branch C, Verse 5) Their first attempt to take down all the Intoners ends in disaster, with Zero losing her arm and Michael being wounded and forced to reincarnate as the child dragon Mikhail. During their second attempt, they attack each one individually: after killing one, Zero takes on their disciple,Disciple: in the Japanese version a servant created to magnify the Intoners' powers, who each help in battle and act as a personal harem. Before facing One, Zero reverts her disciples to their original bird forms, releasing them from their servitude.Zero: It's unavoidable. Disciples can't remain in human form without an Intoner's power. Sooner or later, you'll disappear. So before that happens... I'm giving you your old forms back. (Branch A, Chapter 5, Verse 3) During the battle, both One and Mikhail are killed, then Zero is killed by a male clone of One created as a fail-safe in the event of Zero's victory.One: Brother. I'm One's brother. / Zero: Brother? That's...impossible... / One: You wouldn't know. You only had your five sisters. But in the same way you \\"created\\" your sisters... Your sister One created me. I was a failsafe in case you managed to kill her. I was her final weapon. (Branch A, Chapter 5, Verse 4) Around this central timeline, various \\"branches\\" appear, caused by \\"singularities\\", namely Zero, her sisters and the Disciples.Accord: In the flow of post-Cataclysm history, if a unique set of conditions known as \\"singularities\\" come together, splits occur in time, resulting in the multiple world divergence phenomenon. (Branch B, Verse 1) During her progression through these branches, Zero is monitored by Accord, one of a race called Recorders charged with monitoring and recording history.Zero: What the hell are you, anyway? / Accord: We're Recorders. [...] It's our job to record world events from the ancient past to the distant future. You know the Old World you people are always going on about? Well, I was sent by folks from there. (Branch B, Chapter 2, Lost Verse 2) In the second branch, while going to kill her sister Three, Zero witnesses the flower driving her sisters insane, with Three dying from poisons in the forest and One being murdered by an unhinged Two. In the ensuing battle, the disciples and Two are killed, then Mikhail is poisoned. Zero uses the flower to form a \\"pact\\" with Mikhail, resurrecting him.Accord: By utilizing the reprogramming function of the flower, the singularity known as Zero has created a new concept known as a pact. I do not know how this will affect the future. However, I will continue to observe events as they unfold. (Branch B, Ending B)Pact: in the original Japanese In the third branch, Mikhail is regressed by the Intoners to a childlike form incapable of properly defending Zero, and Zero's disciples are killed when Two self-destructs. When Mikhail is killed by One's dragon, Zero and One do battle and One is killed. Mentally unbalanced by the event, Zero sets off to find another dragon, but it is hinted that she fails.Accord: The Intoner Zero completed her objective. However, the dragon Mikhail has died and Zero's mental health is in a rather alarming state. I'm afraid there's little chance of finding a solution in this timeline. As such, I recommend sealing off this branch. (Branch C, Ending C) In the fourth branch, Zero manages to kill all of her sisters and absorb their powers, managing to take down One with help from Accord. After absorbing all their powers, she and Mikhail are transported to another world and Mikhail destroys the monster Zero transforms into. With this, the flower's magic is sealed away, although Accord speculates that Zero might have survived and would reappear in some form.Accord: The Intoners have been sealed off in another world. The threat of the flower has been extinguished from this branch. However, the possibility exists that this seal could unravel itself at some time or location in the future. Until then, our recording efforts will continue. Oh. And a personal addendum regarding my observational target, Zero. Perhaps this is beyond my functional requirements as a recorder, but I cannot shake the feeling that somehow, somewhere, Zero is still alive. And that, someday... Someday, she and I will see each other again. Crazy, I know. Call it a hunch. (Branch D, The Final Song) In the novel Drag-On Dragoon 3 Story Side, a novel detailing the events leading directly into Drakengard, a combination of events from other branches occurs. During the final confrontation with One, Mikhail is poisoned and Zero forms a pact with Mikhail to save him. After killing One, One's clone kills Zero. Reception Zero has received a mixed reaction from western video game critics. GamesRadar's Becky Cunningham praised Tara Platt's performance in the role, and that her relationship with Mikhail helped humanize her. GameSpot's Heidi Kemps found Zero entertaining despite her negative portrayal, enjoying the points where she breaks the fourth wall to critique the game's puzzles and finding that she \\"related to [Zero] as the game progressed, which is not something I typically feel for antihero characters.\\" Eurogamer's Chris Schilling found that Zero's presence turned the game into \\"a jet-black comedy\\", comparing her favorably to Jordan Belfort: while both unlikable characters, there was \\"something magnetic about their horribleness\\". Destructoid's Chris Carter commended Drakengard 3 and Zero, saying \\"[he] was drawn into [Drakengard 3's] world and its cast of characters, and I wanted to see Zero's journey through from start to finish.\\" This view was shared by Will Borger of Gaming Bolt, who called story, characters, world, and in particular Zero, the reasons for playing the game. In addition, he felt that players would find themselves relating to her more as the story progressed. Jim Sterling of The Escapist wrote that Zero's portrayal, especially her sexual empowerment and the fact that she had dominance over the male characters, was \\"refreshing\\". Capsule Computers' Travis Bruno commented that Zero is \\"largely the villain of the series\\", but that he felt the need to see her journey through to its end. Ron Duwell of Techno Buffalo, while commenting on the quality of the design of the characters, claimed that Zero was \\"the best looking of the bunch with her acrobatic kicks and sword slashes being pulled off without a hitch.\\" Geoff Thew of Hardcore Gamer complimented the character, calling her actions, attitudes and language \\"a nicely self-contained example of how [Drakengard 3] plays with juxtaposition.\\" Mike Splechta of GameZone agreed, stating \\"the character designs were fantastic. I loved Zero's look in particular; her white flowy dress only serves as a contrast to her violent behavior since it gets drenched in blood the more you tear enemies apart with her weapons.\\" RPGFans Derek Heemsbergen referred to Zero as \\"foul-mouthed butcher\\", although he was generally positive about her story and her interactions with Mikhail and the disciples, calling the latter \\"strange and often hilarious\\". Andrew Barker, in an analysis of the game for RPGFan, referred to her as \\"violence personified\\", noting how the game gradually justified her actions. She was also noted, alongside One, as being the only Intoner who had no real need for a disciple. In a final note, he said that he only felt comfortable with Zero during the game's fourth branch, where her motives were revealed. Anime News Network's Todd Ciolek described her as a conscious mockery of standard action-game protagonists, referring to her as \\"murderous, foul-mouthed, impulsive, abusive, and all but impossible to like.\\" In contrast, Kimberley Wallace of Game Informer was not as enthusiastic, saying that while Zero had some good one-liners, \\"the better efforts are buried in a lot of bad party banter.\\" RPGamer's Michael Cunningham found Zero to be an \\"angry, vulgar woman [...] impatient, aggressive, and easily irritated\\", and that the lack of explanation behind Zero's actions negatively affected the plot. IGN's Meghan Sullivan was also fairly negative, saying that Zero's character, interactions and motivation were badly let down by poor writing. USGamer's Kat Bailey was generally unenthusiastic about Zero's general attitude and portrayal, saying that she was \\"characterized in large part by her apparent love of killing and her aggressive bitchiness toward her companion dragon\\". Roger Hargreaves for Metro agreed, finding Zero to be a \\"thoroughly unpleasant and unlikeable main character.\\" Crunchyroll's Nate Ming was highly critical of Zero, calling her \\"a ruthless, backstabbing, front- stabbing, cold-hearted bitch\\", and said that she would be the villain in any other game. The character has been positively received by series fans in Japan. In a popularity contest for the characters of Drakengard 3, Zero came in as the fourth most popular character of the game, with her dragon Mikhail taking first place. In the 2014 Dengeki PlayStation Awards, Zero was placed as the fourth best character of 2013. Beyond the Drakengard universe, both Zero had her dragon Mikhail appeared in the second sequel to the arcade game Lord of Vermilion.

The mountains are in the southern portion of the Eastern Highlands, or Manica Highlands, a belt of highlands that extend north and south along the international border, between the Zambezi and Save rivers. The Chimanimani Mountains include Monte Binga (2,436 m), the highest peak in Mozambique and the second-highest in Zimbabwe. The mountains are home to diverse forests, savannas, montane grasslands, and heathlands. Zimbabwe's Chimanimani National Park and Mozambique's adjacent Chimanimani National Reserve protect parts of the range. These two parks, together with a larger buffer zone, constitute Chimanmani Transfrontier Conservation Area.Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T.

The mountains are in Chimanimani District of Zimbabwe's Manicaland Province, and Sussundenga District of Mozambique's Manica Province. Climate The mountains rise out the low Mozambican plain, and the eastward-facing slopes intercept moisture- laden winds from the Indian Ocean, creating much orographic precipitation. There are no weather stations in the wetter Mozambican portion of the range. The western slopes on the Zimbabean side of the range are in the mountains' rain shadow, and generally drier. Zimbabwean stations at Chimanimani and Chisengu reported 1074 mm and 1406 mm, respectively.Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T.

The Chimanimani Mountains' montane plant communities are Afromontane, and share many species with other high-elevation mountain regions scattered from South Africa to Ethiopia. 70 montane plant species are endemic to the Chimanimani Mountains.Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T. (2016). Chimanimani Mountains: Botany and Conservation. Report produced under CEPF Grant 63512. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. 95 pp. Grasslands Grassland is most widespread vegetation, found on level and rolling terrain. Grasslands are of three main types - quartzite grasslands, schist grasslands, and wet or hydromorphic grasslands. The quartzite and schist grassland types are determined by the underlying geology. The quartzite grasslands generally grow low, with tufted grasses. Common grasses are Loudetia simplex, Sporobolus festivus, Panicum brazzavillense, Elionurus muticus, Monocymbium ceresiiforme, Panicum ecklonii, Rhytachne rottboellioides, and Trachypogon spicatus. Quartzite grasslands cover an area of 50 to 100 km2. Schist grasslands grow on soils derived from schist, which are generally red in color and deeper and more nutrient-rich than quartzite- derived soils. Schist grasslands grow taller and denser, with Themeda triandra as the dominant grass, along the grasses Loudetia simplex, Tristachya hispida, Monocymbium ceresiiforme, and the sedge Bulbostylis contexta. The shrubs Protea caffra subsp. gazensis, Indigofera cecilii, and Morella chimanimaniana and the bracken fern Pteridium aquilinum are also typical. Schist grasslands cover an area of approximately 150 km2. Shrublands Shrublands grow on steeper slopes, are of two main types, Ericaceous and Proteaceous. Ericaceous scrub is found on quartite-derived soils above 1200 meters elevation. It is characterized by shrubs in the heath family Ericaceae, including Erica hexandra, Philippia simii, Erica pleiotricha, E. johnstonii, and E. lanceolifera. The ericaceous scrubland includes many other species, including many of the species endemic to the Eastern Highlands and Chimanimani Mountains. Proteaceous scrub is found on schist-derived soils between 1100 and 1800 meters elevation, interspersed with schist grasslands. Dominant shrubs are from the protea family (Proteaceae), including Protea caffra, P . welwitschii, P . wentzeliana, and Leucospermum saxosum, together with smaller shrubs, herbs, and grasses. Other shrubland types are mixed sclerophyll scrub, which contains a mix of Ericaceous and Proteaceous species, and bracken scrub, characterized by the bracken fern Pteridium aquilinum together with shrubs and tall grasses. Bracken scrub is found on richer soils near forest patches. Woodlands The mountains are home to three types of miombo woodland. Trees are generally 4 to 8 meters high, with 20 to 60% canopy cover, with grasses and bracken covering the ground. Mzhenje (Uapaca kirkiana) woodland is found on east-facing slopes below 1200 meters elevation, typically on schist- derived soils. Mzhenge is accompanied by the trees Brachystegia utilis, Pterocarpus angolensis, and Pericopsis angolensis at lower elevations. Msasa (Brachystegia spiciformis) woodland is also found on schist soils. Trees tend to grow low (2 to 4 meters high) and widely scattered at higher elevations. At lower elevations the trees grow higher and closer, and Uapaca kirkiana and Faurea saligna accompany msasa. Woodland of Brachystegia tamarindoides subsp. microphylla grows on quartzite outcrops and rocky slopes. The trees grow low and spreading, and are draped with tassels of Usnea lichen. Forests Montane forests occur in scattered patches, typically in sheltered areas with access to year-round moisture. Small patches of 1 to 5 hectares are most common, with patches up to 30 km in some locations. The largest patch discovered by Timberlake et al. was 240 hectares, on a west-facing slope above the Nyahedzi River.Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T. (2016). Chimanimani Mountains: Botany and Conservation. Report produced under CEPF Grant 63512. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. 95 pp. Trees form a closed canopy 10 to 15 meters high. Lianas and epiphytes are common in the canopy, and the understory plants are mostly ferns and mosses. Common forest trees include Schefflera umbellifera, Ilex mitis, Macaranga mellifera, Maesa lanceolata, Morella pilulifera, Podocarpus milanjianus, and Syzygium cordatum. Widdringtonia nodiflora occurs in drier patches. A transitional forest type can be found on the edges of forest patches, and along streams and gullies in grassland and shrubland areas, and includes a mix of forest and Ericaceous shrub species, together with grasses and bracken ferns. The transitional forests include the large shrubs and small trees Philippia mannii, Englerophytum magalismontanum, Rapanea melanophloeos, and Myrsine africana. Groves of the large banana-like shrub Strelitzia caudata and the tree fern Cyathea capensis grow in sheltered stream-side locales surrounded by more open vegetation. History The Ndau people have lived in the area around the Chimanimani Mountains for centuries. In the early 19th century, Nguni-speaking people left what is now South Africa to settle in the Save River valley. The Nguni leader Soshangane founded the Gaza Empire, which subjugated the area from the Limpopo to the Zambezi rivers, including the local Ndau people. In the late 19th century the Gaza Empire came into conflict with European colonial empires ‚Äì the British expanding north from South Africa, and the Portuguese expanding from the coast of Mozambique into the interior. The Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891 fixed the boundary between the United Kingdom's and Portugal's colonial possessions in southern and eastern Africa, and divided the Chimanimani mountains between the British Southern Rhodesia colony and Portugal's Mozambique colony. Differing interpretations of the treaty language by the governments of the UK and Portugal revived the boundary dispute, and settlement of the boundary between the Zambezi and Save rivers was arbitrated by Paul Honor√© Vigliani, an assistant to the King of Italy. The arbitration was completed on January 30 1897, establishing the international boundary which has persisted until the present day.\\"Arbitration between Great Britain and Portugal as regards questions relative to the delimitation of their spheres of influence in East Africa (Manica plateau)\\". Reports of International Arbitral Awards, Volume XXVIII pp. 283-322, 30 January 1897. The new boundary split the Ndau communities who live on either side of it. The government of Southern Rhodesia established Chimanimani National Park in 1949, with an original area of 82 km2. The park was later expanded to 155 km2. In 1953 the colonial government of Mozambique gazetted the forest reserves of Maronga, Zomba and Moribane on the mountains' southeastern slope. Both colonial governments also expanded logging and agriculture during the 1940s and 50s. Southern Rhodesia's forestry department and private companies created extensive plantations of pine, wattle, and Eucalyptus in the mountains and valleys west of the National Park boundary. The Mozambican colonial government established sawmills and timber concessions in the lower-elevation forests and dense woodlands southeast of the mountains.Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T. (2016). Chimanimani Mountains: Botany and Conservation. Report produced under CEPF Grant 63512. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. 95 pp. Mozambique became independent from Portugal in 1975, but suffered a civil war from 1977 to 1992. Southern Rhodesia declared independence as Rhodesia under an exclusive white-minority government in 1965. The Rhodesian Bush War, or Zimbabwe Independence War, raged from 1964 to 1979. During the war, mountain passes in the Chimanimani area were frequently used by guerilla fighters moving between Zimbabwe and their camps in Mozambique, and the guerrillas laid mines along local roads to disrupt the local economy. The passes were heavily mined by Rhodesian government forces to prevent guerilla movements. In 1980 a settlement was reached which gave the country's black majority full political participation, and the country was renamed Zimbabwe. Decades later land mines remain a hazard in the area, particularly after heavy rain. In 2003 the Mozambican government created Chimanimani National Reserve, with an area 640.6 km2 that encompasses the high mountains on the Mozambican side.

Krishnan is also a member of the politburo of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (CPI-ML), and the editor of its monthly publication, Liberation. She is a women's rights activist who has publicised the problem of violence against women following the 2012 Delhi gang rape of Nirbhaya. Early background and personal life Kavita Krishnan was born to Tamil parents in Coonoor, Tamil Nadu. She grew up in Bhilai, Chhattisgarh. Her father worked as an engineer at a steel plant while her mother taught English. She completed her BA from St.Xavier's college,Mumbai. Krishnan received an MPhil in English Literature at Jawaharlal Nehru University. Biography =Early Activism= Kavita Krishnan became part of a theater group led by Arun Ferreira in St. Xavier's College, Mumbai (affiliated college of University of Mumbai) and she would participate in street plays and protests. Her serious stint with political activism took place when she joined the Jawaharlal Nehru University where she earned her master's degree and was elected Joint Secretary of the Students' Union in 1995. She was a member of the All India Students Association while she studied in JNU. She became seriously involved with activism when she met the student leader Chandrashekhar Prasad who was also a student at JNU and a member of AISA. Fondly remembered as Chandu by the students of JNU even today, Chandrashekhar was murdered along with fellow CPI(ML) leader Shyam Narayan Yadav on 31 March 1997 in Siwan, Bihar while addressing a street meeting. Kavita Krishnan's life as an activist took a serious turn after this incident. Chandrashekhar, who had been the President of the JNU Students' Union the year before Krishnan was elected the Joint Secretary, was the first to recognise her passion and to suggest her to work full-time for women's rights. Following Chandu's murder, thousands of JNU students participated in mass demonstrations, demanding action against former Rashtriya Janata Dal parliamentarian Mohammad Shahabuddin, whose men, they alleged, had carried out the attack. Krishnan was part of the protests in Delhi, where the student protesters were attacked by Laloo Yadav's men at Bihar Bhawan. She spent eight days in jail for her participation in the protests. =Role in Nirbhaya Protests= While emerging as one of the most influential activists during the massive anti-rape protests that followed the rape and murder of a 23-year-old girl in India's capital city, New Delhi, Kavita Krishnan has contributed substantially to shaping the discourse of the movement. One of the speeches that she made at the protest outside Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit's house quickly went viral on YouTube and has received over 60,000 views so far. In this speech, she laid out a kind of manifesto of the movement, one that represented a major break from the securitised, protectionist standpoint which was rife at that time and articulated women's freedom as the main demand. In this speech, she argued against the prevalent commonsense that death penalty was the solution to rape. She pointed out that the conviction rates for rape in India are extremely low and, therefore, methods such as chemical castration and death penalty can't act as deterrents. She made a strong case for arguing on the basis of women's \\"unqualified freedom\\", \\"freedom without fear\\". Her views on death penalty have been influential in shaping the discourse around rape in the aftermath of the post 16 December anti-rape protests. The demand for \\"Freedom Without Fear\\" became a rallying point for anti-rape protesters, and Kavita Krishnan's views on \\"Freedom\\" were extensively published. =Harassment= Like other female politicians in India, Krishnan has been harassed online through social media. She had told reporters that online trolls are \\"going after me regularly, routinely, for my skin color, for my looks, telling me I'm not worth raping, what kind of torture and rape I should be subjected to, telling me what kind of men I should be sleeping with...\\" Criticism and Controversies Kavita had been criticised by supporters of BJP and RSS for her controversial tweet on PM Narendra Modi. This tweet was followed by media and right wing backlash..

They developed the interactive fiction game Depression Quest, which was released in 2013. In 2014, a blog post by Quinn's ex- boyfriend sparked the Gamergate controversy, in which Quinn was subjected to extensive harassment.  Early life  Quinn was born in 1987 and was raised in a small town near the Adirondack Mountains in New York. Growing up, a favorite video game was Commander Keen, an MS-DOS game featuring an eight- year-old protagonist who builds a spaceship with items found around his house and then travels the Galaxy defending the Earth. Quinn suffered from depression as a teenager, having been diagnosed with the condition at age 14. They described receiving little sympathy or assistance from school district officials who were \\"less than understanding about teens with depression and suicide issues\\".  Career  At the age of 24, Quinn moved to Canada and made their first foray into video game programming. Their first game was the result of a six-week course on video game creation that they attended after seeing an advertisement in a newspaper. In a later interview for The New Yorker, they said, \\"I felt like I'd found my calling.\\" = Depression Quest = One of Quinn's earliest creative works, Depression Quest, was conceived as a \\"choose- your-own path\\" adventure detailing the troubled life of a person suffering from depression, with many of the \\"correct\\" paths blocked due to the protagonists' struggle with mental self-care. Quinn thought this sort of game narrative would be a good way to depict depression, imposing a set of rules on players they might not experience in their day-to-day lives. Depression Quest was released in February 2013. Quinn attempted to publish the game on Steam Greenlight service twice in December 2013 and later in August 2014, when it was accepted and released by Steam. Depression Quest was featured in a Playboy article as one of several video games dealing with the subjective experience of depression. = Other projects = Quinn created the Game Developer Help List, designed to bring experienced game developers and novice developers into contact with one another. In 2014, Quinn intended to be part of the canceled YouTube reality television show codenamed \\"Game_Jam\\", which was meant to bring together a number of prominent indie game developers. In 2015, Quinn served as a narrative design consultant for Loveshack Entertainment's iOS game Framed.Mckeand, Kirk (January 28, 2015) \\"How Loveshack found a new order with iOS hit Framed\\", Pocket Gamer.biz. Retrieved April 16, 2020. As of 2014 Quinn was also working on a full motion video game starring Greg Sestero. In 2015, Quinn wrote a chapter for Videogames for Humans, a book about games made using the Twine tool. Quinn also contributed a chapter to the book The State of Play: Sixteen Voices on Video Games, detailing their experiences making Depression Quest and the subsequent harassment they faced. In 2015, Quinn appeared in the documentary GTFO. They also wrote a scenario for \\"Widow's Walk\\", an expansion for Betrayal at House on the Hill, released in 2016. In September 2016, Quinn was reported to be working with erotica author Chuck Tingle on a full motion dating sim under the working title \\"Project Tingler\\". In January 2018, Quinn's role as Narrative Designer at Heart Machine's upcoming game Solar Ash Kingdom was also announced. In June 2018, Quinn's career as a comics writer started with the announcement of their work with illustrator Robbi Rodriguez on DC Vertigo's Goddess Mode, which became one of the last comics released under the Vertigo label. In July 2019, their participation in the upcoming issues of IDW Publishing's The Addams Family: The Bodies Issue and Marvel's Fearless was announced. Quinn has additionally worked on Fez, Jazzpunk,Jazzpunk Credits. Giant Bomb. and They Bleed Pixels.They Bleed Pixels Credits. Giant Bomb. Quinn is interested in human enhancement and has implanted an NTAG216 NFC chip in the back of their hand that can be programmed to perform various functions. Their first use of the chip was to load it with the download code for the game Deus Ex. Quinn also has a magnetic implant in their left ring finger. = Harassment and Gamergate = In August 2014, Eron Gjoni, a former boyfriend of Quinn, posted a lengthy blog post detailing his relationship with Quinn. Based on the contents of the post, Quinn was falsely accused of receiving positive coverage from a journalist with whom they were in a relationship. It was later shown that the journalist in question had only once briefly mentioned Quinn's work, and not while they were in a relationship. These accusations sparked the Gamergate controversy. Quinn suffered a long period of harassment including doxing, rape threats, and death threats. Harassment associated with Gamergate resulted in widespread recognition of sexism in gaming. According to The New Yorker, the harassment escalated to the point where Quinn left their home and began working with the authorities to identify those responsible for the harassment. Quinn detailed the experience in an interview on MSNBC's Ronan Farrow Daily, saying that Gamergate represented a rapidly shrinking fringe among an increasingly diverse gaming community and those attacking Quinn and other women in gaming needed \\"to just grow up\\". Speaking with BBC News, Quinn said the harassment had consumed their life, leading them to feel as if \\"surrounded by nothing but hate it's virulent, it's everywhere\\" and that they were \\"just trying to survive\\". The attacks boiled down to \\"the same accusation everybody makes toward every successful woman: she got to where she is because she had sex with someone\\" and Quinn also pointed out that Gamergate had targeted \\"the people with the least power in the industry\\". \\"[I] used to go to games events and feel like I was going home... Now it's just like... are any of the people I'm currently in the room with, the ones that said they wanted to beat me to death?\\" Quinn says their therapist remarked of the harassment, \\"I don't even know what to tell you, this is so far outside anything I'm aware of.\\" In January 2015, Quinn co-founded Crash Override, a private network of experts to assist victims of online harassment which in March 2015 joined forces with Randi Harper's Online Abuse Prevention Initiative. Quinn (second from the left) speaking at the Game Developers Conference in March 2016 On September 24, 2015, Quinn spoke at the United Nations along with Anita Sarkeesian about online harassment. In their speech, Quinn spoke about the need for technology companies to provide proper moderation and terms of service which protect marginalized groups. They also raised concerns about providing better protections for transgender women and victims of domestic violence on the Internet. Quinn identified as non-cisgender in January 2017. In September 2017, Quinn published the memoir Crash Override: How Gamergate (Nearly) Destroyed My Life, and How We Can Win the Fight Against Online Hate. The book has received generally positive reviews, with critics praising what they described as Quinn's thoughtful, nuanced portrayal of their harassers, but lamenting the book's \\"scattered\\" narrative flow. The book was nominated for the 2018 Hugo Award for Best Related Work (i.e., non-fiction work related to science fiction or fantasy).\\"2018 Hugo Award Finalists Announced\\" Tor.com 3-31-2018  Bibliography   Notes   References   Further reading  *  External links  1987 births Living people American video game designers American video game programmers American expatriates in Canada Independent video game developers People from New York (state) Video game artists Place of birth missing (living people) Victims of cyberbullying Non-binary writers LGBT writers from the United States LGBT artists from the United States LGBT people from New York (state) ","title":"Zo√´ Quinn"},{"id":"42912393","title":"Haughmond F.C."},{"id":"42912396","text":"Ian Thomas (born 2 April 1950) is a former Australian cricket umpire.

In addition to the Cubist painters, his work shows influence by Paul C√©zanne, Wassily Kandinsky, Utagawa Kuniyoshi, Paul Klee, Stuart Davis, and Agnes Weinrich. It is nonetheless, in use of heavy line, rendering of depth, disciplined treatment of color, and architecture of planes, distinctly his own. Early life and work Karl Knaths was born October 21, 1891, in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. His parents were Otto Julius Knaths and Maria Theresa Knaths. Shortly after Knaths's birth the family moved to Portage, Wisconsin where he spent his childhood years. When he was in his late teens his father died and he became apprenticed to his mother's brother, George Dietrich, in the baking trade. Although he had begun making sketches, he had no art instruction and little time for self-instruction. While attending Portage High School he met the local author, Zona Gale. She encouraged his interest and, upon his graduation in 1910, both convinced his uncle to release him from apprenticeship and introduced him to Dudley Crafts Watson of the Milwaukee Art Institute. During the next year he studied art at the Institute. He obtained the job by which he supported himself when Gale introduced him to Laura Sherry, the director of the Wisconsin Players. Despite his youth and inexperience, Sherry took him on as caretaker of the playhouse and one of its set designers. In 1911, on advice from Gale and Craft, Knaths began studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. There, he mainly supported himself as janitor's assistant but when the 1913 Armory Show came to town he landed a job at the show as one of the guards. The show was his first substantial exposure to European modernism and he later reported that the experience both confused and awed him. Uncomfortable with most of the work on display, he found much to like in the works of C√©zanne, particularly the blocks of muted color out of which he built his compositions. In 1917 Knaths rejoined the Wisconsin Players as the group's scenery painter during a tour of East Coast theaters. When the Players arrived in Provincetown, Massachusetts for a performance of Gale's Mr. Pitt Knaths recognized it as a place where he could successfully practice his vocation. After two years' military service Knaths spent a short time studying art in New York City and then, in 1919, moved to Provincetown, which became his principal residence for the rest of his life. In the early twentieth century Provincetown was a prosperous fishing town which attracted artists and theater people from New York's Greenwich Village as summer residents. On or soon after his arrival he met two sisters, Helen and Agnes Weinrich of the Provincetown Printers. The sisters had grown up on a prosperous Iowa farm, daughters of German immigrant parents. When in their 20s they had accompanied their father on a trip to Germany where Helen studied music and Agnes painting. Their father dying, they received an inheritance which permitted them to live and travel on their own and they returned to Germany and France to study further. In 1914 the sisters began spending the warm months of the year in Provincetown and, through contact with European expatriates who settled there during World War I, Agnes learned to employ Modernist and particularly Cubist techniques in her work. After their first meeting Agnes helped Knaths to develop his personal style of painting and over time they developed a close and mutually beneficial working relationship. In 1922 Knaths married Helen and moved into the house which the sisters had rented. He was then 30, Helen 45, and Agnes 46. Agnes remained a member of the Knaths's household the rest of her life. Knaths's earliest work has the strong lines, blocks of muted colors, and juxtaposition of rectangular and curvilinear forms which characterize his mature style. One of his early paintings, Horse Barns, Provincetown (1919, gouache, 7x8\\") contains three barn structures within a small grove of trees and bushes. It shows influence of C√©zanne and is not notably Cubist. The coloration is low-key in green, purple, and ochre hues. The composition has sweeping rounded shapes beside heavily outlined rhombuses and other quadrilateral shapes. It has a painterly, nearly impressionist feel and, despite the subject matter, might as well be a still life as a landscape. Mature style Knaths's mature style emerged in the early 1930s. It evolved, he said, as he \\"learned to move slowly from color relations, to line sequence, to better spacing, proportions, to a thematic play of shapes.\\" During the 1920s he had studied, and sometimes translated from German, theoretical publications of theorists and artists, including Carl Einstein, Wilhelm Ostwald, Piet Mondrian, Wassily Kandinsky, and Jay Hambidge. He later reported that he was particularly impressed by ideas presented by Gino Severini in Du cubisme au classicisme; esth√©tique du compas et du nombre (Paris, J. Povolozky & Cie, 1921). While these books deal mainly with color, proportion, and Bauhaus design theory, Knaths was also interested in the relationship between music and painting and in this it is likely his wife, Helen, who was a conservatory-trained musician and whose piano playing he enjoyed almost daily, was an influence. Knaths's interests in theories of color, proportion, and music bore fruit in a system that, while it was mathematically influenced and employed a formal method of color selection, retained the lyricism which marks most of his work. The methodology he followed rather enhanced than inhibited his freedom of expression. In his case, as with many poets and musicians, a voluntary submission to rules of form and design seems to have helped rather than hindered him in achieving his goals. An art historian summarized this lyricism, writing that Knaths's approach to Cubism was romantic rather than academic or literal. Another wrote that Knaths's paintings are personal expressions of both theory and feeling which arise from his love of nature, his close bond with his community, and a \\"poetic meditation on human life.\\" A third simply calls Knaths a poet of painting. Knaths himself wrote on this subject: \\"Systems are only bricks and lumber ‚Äî of themselves they cannot encompass the immeasurable spiritual qualities that go into a successful picture. The unlooked-for things that happen in the process of work are the important ones.\\" A detailed description of Knaths's application of theory to his practice of art is given in Four American Expressionists: Doris Caesar, Chaim Gross, Karl Knaths, Abraham Rattner, pp. 16‚Äì17 (New York, Whitney Museum of American Art, 1959) and also in \\"Karl Knaths To Teach at Art Gallery,\\" Alice Graeme, The Washington Post, February 20, 1938, p. TT5. Karl Knaths, painting of 1964 entitled \\"Pumpkin\\"; 30\\" x 36\\"; oil on canvas A painting from Knaths's mature period, Pumpkin, shows his integration of the abstract Cubist idiom with a representational tabletop still life. Strong calligraphic lines demarcate planes of both bright and muted colors and the composition can be viewed as both two- and three-dimensional: either blocks of color juxtaposed in rectangular and curvilinear shapes or a foreground still-life grouping  a table holding bottle, glass, pieces of fruit, and pumpkin  within an abstract enclosed space with what appear to be windows or panels on a rear wall. The background at left bears similarity to a wall in the artist's studio shown in a photo of 1961 and this suggests that the windows or panels at right might be paintings. Once he had established his mature style Knaths allowed himself freedom to range widely from its core elements. This is most obvious during his mid-1930s employment as artist in the WPA Federal Art Project and the Section of Painting and Sculpture. His post office murals have the same social realist style as most of the others produced by New Deal artists. See for example his Frontier Mail in the post office at Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. It can also be seen, for example, in a painting of 1936 called Composition showing two men seated at a table with a coffee pot and mugs, a woman standing with broom in hand, and a cat lying on the floor of a sparsely-furnished room. Although having a Cubist surface quality, it could not be said to be an abstract painting. Frontier Mail and Composition contrast strongly with a painting he made before either of them: Maritime, a composition whose subjects are much more symbolically nautical than recognizably displayed. Later life and work In the early years of his marriage, Knaths, Helen, and Agnes lived on the sisters' legacy and what little money Knaths brought in through odd jobs and the occasional sale of a painting. The winter months were cold and their house so drafty that, even though Knaths disliked city life, they spent much of that season in New York. In 1924 Helen and Agnes bought land on which Knaths constructed a house and studio using materials from nearby derelict buildings. He recognized that he needed to establish connections with dealers and exhibitors if he wished to find buyers for his art and, together with Agnes, he used his time in New York as well as trips to Boston and Washington, D.C. to do just that. In 1921 he exhibited paintings at New York's Society of Independent Artists for the first of many occasions. Knaths showed two and Agnes Weinrich three paintings in this large non-juried show without prizes. In 1926 Knaths's work appeared in another show, the Soci√©t√© Anonyme exhibition, held in Brooklyn, and, that same year, the collector, Duncan Phillips bought his Geranium in Night Window of 1922. Of the purchase Phillips, who was not an impulsive buyer, noted: \\"This exceptionally promising canvas reveals a delightful sense of color relations and a developed knowledge of what happens to colors under a flickering play of light.\\" This proved to be the first of many purchases by Phillips and the beginning of a long and mutually rewarding friendship between the two men. During the next few years Phillips would write appreciative articles about Knaths's work and, in 1929, would devote a room in his Washington, D.C. gallery to their display. On opening the room he gave Knaths his first one-person show. A year later Knaths was given a second solo exhibition, this one at the gallery of Charles Daniel in New York. That year Daniel became Knaths's first art dealer. In 1931 Knaths left Daniel for the Downtown Gallery and soon after he moved, this time to the J.B. Neumann Gallery. In 1945 he moved to the gallery of Paul Rosenberg & Co., which then continued to show and sell his work during the remainder of his life. Knaths, who liked the quiet life, did not travel extensively and never to Europe. He did not seek celebrity and, while he appreciated the income that came with recognition of his talent, he was not extravagant in his expenses or style of living. He was neither outgoing nor reclusive, enjoying company and establishing close relationships within the community where he lived, but relishing a quite daily routine. Rising early, he would paint during the morning hours and, during the afternoon would study, listen to music, do chores, and wander his beloved Cape Cod environs. He was a gifted instructor but taught for brief periods at a time. Between 1938 and 1950 he gave lectures during the winter session of the Phillips Gallery Art School. From 1943 to 1945 he taught art courses at Bennington College. He also he lectured at Black Mountain College in 1944 at the Skowhegan School of Painting in 1948. Among his pupils was Dorothy Fratt. Throughout his career Knaths drew inspiration from the natural environment in which he lived. The images he made of his everyday world include many still lifes and room interiors as well as outdoor paintings of local fishermen and clam diggers, wild and domesticated animals, and Cape Cod marine life. His choice of subjects was generally consistent while his treatment of them varied in degree of abstraction. While young he was one of a relatively small number of American painters whose work was termed modernist and, as he matured, he grew to be one of the best known among them. By the early 1930s critics had begun to take note of Knaths and give his work more than a passing mention. In 1931 the critic for the New York Sun could say that his work had been known in the art world for quite a few years and was fairly widely collected. While abstract, his paintings possessed, this critic wrote, \\"a very individual kind of realism.\\" \\"One feels in his work,\\" he went on, \\"a love for the medium, rich textural quality, and a very unusual color harmony which varies with the subject.\\" By the late 1940s appreciative notices such as this one became reasonably common. Beginning about 1944 newspaper art critics more frequently would analyze and usually praise his work rather than simply listing it as appearing in a show. For example, in that year A. Z. Kruse wrote a piece about his work in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle and in the late 1940s his work was featured in articles in Art News and the New York Times. In 1949 he was featured in an article by Elaine de Kooning, \\"Knaths Paints a Picture,\\" in Art News. Knaths's inaugural show in 1947 at the Paul Rosenberg Gallery was seen by one critic to be one of the ten best exhibitions of the year. In 1950 his painting Basket Bouquet won first prize in the Metropolitan Museum \\"American Painting Today\\" competition. This prize cemented his reputation as one of America's leading modernists and also marked the beginning of what would become a gradual falling off of interest in his work. The \\"American Painting Today\\" competition touched off a rebellion by the new generation of New York painters. Calling themselves The Irascibles, a group of abstract expressionists wrote a protest complaining that the jury was hostile to the \\"advanced art\\" which they produced. The signatories were the most prominent members of what would come to be called the New York School, men such as Adolph Gottlieb, Robert Motherwell, Clyfford Still, Ad Reinhardt, Jackson Pollock, and Willem de Kooning. The protest of the young painters can be seen in retrospect as a turning point in Knaths's career. During the 1950s, as abstract expressionism gained favor, his work gradually lost popularity. The transition cannot have been unexpected but there was an irony in the fact that when he was a young painter Knaths too rebelled against what he saw as the biases of traditionalist juries. In time, when compared to the abstract expressionists, he began to seem conservative, a pathfinder rather than an innovator. One critic said Knaths did not then aim to break new ground but rather to \\"define the guiding limits within which modern painting must proceed in order to reach it.\\" This is not to say that he stopped working. He continued to work, to show, to sell, and to accrue honors. If he cared at all about his possible displacement by the new movement in the New York art world, he did not show it. In an interview he gave at the time he received the award he made no complaint about the protest but only suggested that the artists might have submitted their work to the jury and protested only if it were not accepted. In another interview, given two years later, he said, mildly, that too many artists \\"aren't willing to work for the final harmony of relationships.\\" He believed they worked too quickly and lacked a habit of critical reflection. On their part the abstract expressionists seem not to have stereotyped Knaths's work as staid and conservative. Barnett Newman, one of the men who signed the 1950 protest letter, felt that it was like the work of Adolph Gottlieb and Mark Rothko in having an intensity of feeling and emotional impact. Of the three he wrote \\"These artists are doing what seems impossible, expressing feelings and thoughts with abstract forms and flat space.\\" There remained an excellent market for Knaths's paintings during the remainder of his life and, at his death, the works left in his estate commanded relatively high prices. Knaths died on March 9, 1971, in Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Massachusetts, after a brief illness. Before entering the hospital he was still living in the house he had built in Provincetown and his widow, Helen, continued to live there the remainder of her life. Personal information =Family= Knaths's father, Otto Julius, was born on October 10, 1846, in Wettin, Germany. An orphan, he attended the Latin School in Halle and emigrated to the United States from Leipzig in 1869. He earned his living as a baker. He married a woman whose name is given as Maria Theresa Dietrich or Tressie Tredeck. Her birth date is not known. She died in 1932. She came from Wisconsin, and, at about the time they were married, she and Otto Julius moved to that state from Cincinnati, Ohio. The couple lived in Eau Claire, where, in 1891, Knaths was born. Soon after, they moved to Portage, Wisconsin, where, at about age 14, young Knaths began working for his uncle, George F. Dietrich, also a baker. Otto Julius died in 1908. Aged 17 at that time, Knaths was living with his uncle as well as apprenticed to him. Knaths had a sister, Olga, who was born December 9, 1893, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and who died January 18, 1981, in Madison, Wisconsin. She married a man named Frank Dunn and they had a son, Francis. Knaths and his wife Helen had no children. Helen's birth name was Lena. She changed it to Helen after 1905 when she and Agnes returned from travels in Europe. She was born in 1876 on a farm in Des Moines County in south east Iowa and died at age 102 in 1978 while living in Provincetown. From the time of Knaths's marriage to Helen and their decision to live together with her sister Agnes, the three formed a bond that survived during the rest of their lives. Agnes was born in 1873 on the same farm as her sister. Agnes was gregarious while Helen was quiet and apparently frail. It was Agnes who managed household for them while Helen stayed largely in the background. Knaths took over this role when Agnes died in 1946. When Knaths died in 1971, Helen showed a vivacious personality that she had previously kept hidden. =Physical appearance and personal traits= Knaths was raised in households where German was commonly spoken and himself spoke with a slight German accent. A voracious reader, he liked to translate German writings on theories of music, colors, and painting and would ask friends to help him make the English plain. Photos of Knaths show him to have been a large man, tall and broad. When in 1910 he went to Milwaukee to study, he was, according to one description, \\"an angular, open-faced boy.\\" His World War I registration card says he had dark hair and blue eyes. People who knew him wrote that he was tall and fit, strong and gentle. Balding in middle life, he wore a beret most of the time. In an interview when he was 62 a reporter described him as \\"apple cheeked\\" and another wrote that at age 72 he was \\"an impressively tall, broad, sturdy man ... with a smooth ruddy face and a steady smile.\\" He was industrious and regular in his work habits. Described as shy, sensitive, and somewhat retiring, he was also said to be modest and charming  a man whose bearing conveyed gravity and whose approach to life and art was passionate. He read philosophy and classical literature as well as writings on art, music, and color theory and he loved to listen to classical music, particularly the works his wife would play on the piano. =Surname= Knaths's surname is pronounced with a hard K. Throughout his career as a professional artist Knaths was known as Karl Knaths. His probable birth name was Otto Karl Knaths. He gave that name while attending high school and when completing his World War II draft registration. The name Otto K. Knaths appears in records for the 1930 and 1940 Census of the United States. The records of the Massachusetts census of 1905 and the U.S. census of 1910, as well as a news article of 1917 give his name as Otto Knaths. Two other names appear in official records. He gave his name as Otto George Knaths when registering for military service in the First World War. and the Massachusetts Death Index lists him as Karl O. Knaths. Since Otto by itself, Otto K., and Otto Karl appear most frequently on official records and since his father's given name was Otto, it is likely Otto Karl Knaths was his birth name. He was still part of the household of his uncle George Dietrich when he used the name Otto George, which might account for that outlying usage.

It was first described in 2005 by psychologist Shane Frederick. The CRT has a moderate positive correlation with measures of intelligence, such as the Intelligence Quotient test, and it correlates highly with various measures of mental heuristics. Later research showed that the CRT is a multifaceted construct: many start their response with the correct answer, while others fail to solve the test even if they reflect on their intuitive first answer. It has also been argued that suppression of the first answer is not the only factor behind the successful performance on the CRT: numeracy and reflectivity both account for performance. Szaszi, B., Szollosi, A., Palfi, B., Acz√©l B., (2017) The cognitive reflection test revisited: exploring the ways individuals solve the test, Thinking and Reasoning, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13546783.2017.1292954 Basis of test According to Frederick, there are two general types of cognitive activity called \\"system 1\\" and \\"system 2\\" (these terms have been first used by Daniel Kahneman). System 1 is executed quickly without reflection, while system 2 requires conscious thought and effort. The cognitive reflection test has three questions that each have an obvious but incorrect response given by system 1. The correct response requires the activation of system 2. For system 2 to be activated, a person must note that their first answer is incorrect, which requires reflection on their own cognition. Correlating measures The test has been found to correlate with many measures of economic thinking, such as numeracy, temporal discounting, risk preference, and gambling preference. It has also been correlated with measures of mental heuristics, such as the gambler's fallacy, understanding of regression to the mean, the sunk cost fallacy, and others. Keith Stanovich found that cognitive ability is not strongly correlated with CRT scores because it will only lead to better CRT performance under certain conditions. First, the test-taker must recognize the need to override their system 1 response, and then they must have available cognitive resources to carry out the override. If the test-taker does not need to inhibit system 1 for the override, then the system 2 response immediately follows. Otherwise, they must have the capacity to sustain inhibition of system 1 in order to engage the system 2 response.Stanovich, Keith E., & West, Richard F. (2008). \\"On the relative independence of thinking biases and cognitive ability.\\" Personality Processes and Individual Differences, 94(4), 672-695. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.94.4.672 http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/94/4/672  Test questions and answers  The original test penned by Dr. Frederick contained only the three following questions: # A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?  cents # If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?  minutes # In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?  days The intuitive answers to these questions that \\"system 1\\" gives typically are: 10 cents, 100 minutes, and 24 days; while the correct solutions are: 5 cents, 5 minutes, and 47 days.  Limitations and alternatives  Studies have estimated that between 44 and 51% of research participants have previously been exposed to the CRT. Those participants that are familiar with the CRT tend to outscore those with no previous exposure, which raises questions about the validity of the measure in this population. In an effort to combat limitations associated with familiarity, researchers have developed a variety of alternative measures of cognitive reflection. Recent research, however, suggests that the CRT is robust to multiple exposure, so that despite the raw score increases in experienced participants, its correlations with other variables remain unaffected  See also  Dual process theory - gives more background about \\"system 1\\" and \\"system 2\\" thinking * Thinking, Fast and Slow, book by Daniel Kahneman * Trick question References Cognitive tests ","title":"Cognitive reflection test"},{"id":"42912456","text":"The 63rd Regiment Indiana Infantry was an infantry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

On June 7, Suarez made his first major league start in a game against the Boston Red Sox, and recorded his first hit, a solo home run. He finished his rookie season with a .242 batting average, with 4 home runs and 23 RBIs in 85 games. =Cincinnati Reds= On December 11, 2014, the Tigers traded Su√°rez and minor league pitcher Jonathon Crawford to the Cincinnati Reds for starting pitcher Alfredo Sim√≥n. On June 11, 2015, he became the Reds' regular starting shortstop after Zack Cozart's season-ending injury. He finished the 2015 season with a .284 batting average, with 13 home runs and 48 RBIs. With the Todd Frazier trade to the Chicago White Sox, the Reds announced Su√°rez would be moved to third base full-time, with Zack Cozart returning to shortstop after his stint on the disabled list.

Its founders include MIT cosmologist Max Tegmark and Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, and its board of advisors includes entrepreneur Elon Musk. Background Max Tegmark professor at MIT, one of the founders and current president of the Future of Life Institute FLI's mission is to catalyze and support research and initiatives for safeguarding life and developing optimistic visions of the future, including positive ways for humanity to steer its course in response to new technologies and challenges. FLI is particularly focused on the potential risks to humanity from the development of human-level or superintelligent artificial general intelligence (AGI). The Institute was founded in March 2014 by MIT cosmologist Max Tegmark, Skype co- founder Jaan Tallinn, Harvard graduate student and International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) medalist Viktoriya Krakovna, Boston University graduate student Meia Chita-Tegmark (Tegmark's wife), and UCSC physicist Anthony Aguirre. The Institute's 14-person Scientific Advisory Board comprises 12 men and 2 women, and includes computer scientists Stuart J. Russell and Francesca Rossi, biologist George Church, cosmologist Saul Perlmutter, astrophysicist Sandra Faber, theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek, entrepreneur Elon Musk, and actors and science communicators Alan Alda and Morgan Freeman (as well as cosmologist Stephen Hawking prior to his death in 2018).  Events  On May 24, 2014, the Future of Life Institute held its opening event at MIT: a panel discussion on \\"The Future of Technology: Benefits and Risks\\", moderated by Alan Alda. The panelists were synthetic biologist George Church, geneticist Ting Wu, economist Andrew McAfee, physicist and Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek and Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn. The discussion covered a broad range of topics from the future of bioengineering and personal genetics to autonomous weapons, AI ethics and the Singularity. On January 2-5, 2015, FLI organized \\"The Future of AI: Opportunities and Challenges\\" conference in Puerto Rico, which brought together the world's leading AI builders from academia and industry to engage with each other and experts in economics, law, and ethics. The goal was to identify promising research directions that can help maximize the future benefits of AI. The Institute circulated an open letter on AI safety at the conference which was subsequently signed by Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and many artificial intelligence experts. On January 5-8, 2017, FLI organized the Beneficial AI conference in Asilomar, California, a private gathering of what The New York Times called \\"heavy hitters of A.I.\\" (including Yann LeCun, Elon Musk, and Nick Bostrom). The institute released a set of principles for responsible AI development that came out of the discussion at the conference, signed by Yoshua Bengio, Yann LeCun, and many other AI researchers. On January 4-7, 2019, FLI organized the Beneficial AGI conference in Puerto Rico. This meeting focused on long-term questions on ensuring that Artificial General Intelligence is beneficial to humanity..  Global research program  On January 15, 2015, the Future of Life Institute announced that Elon Musk had donated $10 million to fund a global AI research endeavor. On January 22, 2015, the FLI released a request for proposals from researchers in academic and other non-profit institutions. Unlike typical AI research, this program is focused on making AI safer or more beneficial to society, rather than just more powerful. On July 1, 2015, a total of $7 million was awarded to 37 research projects.  In the media  United States and Allies Protest U.N.

He dealt mainly with brain injuries of soldiers during the First World War and developed psychometric examination procedures that were used in the treatment of brain-injured patients and in industrial aptitude tests. He was among the first high school teachers who advocated openly for Nazism before the \\"seizure of power\\" (Machtergreifung). His psychometric tests are often used in visual neuropsychology, especially the Poppelreuter figure visual perceptual function test. Biography The son of a high school director, Poppelreuter studied philosophy with a special emphasis on experimental psychology in Berlin and received his doctorate in 1908 in K√∂nigsberg. He then studied medicine and graduated in 1914.Georg Lamberti: Die Psychotechnik in den zwanziger Jahren des 20. Jahrhunderts. In: Georg Lamberti (Hrsg.): Intelligenz auf dem Pr√ºfstand: 100 Jahre Psychometrie. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, G√∂ttingen 2006, , S. 49. He came on as assistant to Gustav Aschaffenburg at the Psychiatric Hospital of Cologne, which during the First World War was the Cologne fortress hospital for head injuries. In 1919, Poppelreuter moved to Bonn and became head of the newly founded \\"Institute for Applied Psychology\\"  trade station for German brain-injured war victims. In 1922, he received a position at the University of Bonn as an associate professor of clinical psychology. Poppelreuter's work on brain injury gave him high professional recognition. He developed a series of psychometric examination methods that were used in industrial psychology and vocational counseling. His clinical interest was given to the possible treatment of neuropsychological dysfunction. Against his resistance Poppelreuter's \\"Brain-Injured Institute\\" moved in 1925 to D√ºsseldorf; however, it had been vacant since 1924. Poppelreuter had given himself a sabbatical in 1923/24 and turned to ergonomic issues at Gelsenkirchen mine association. In 1925, he became head of the Institute of Work Psychology at RWTH Aachen University and founded in 1928 on Adolf Wallichs guided Chair for teaching a laboratory for industrial psycho- technique. Here he continued the experience he had gained from the inclusion of war-disabled in the rationalization of work processes in order. In the winter semester 1931/32 he held a series of lectures on political psychology as applied psychology on the basis of Hitler's book Mein Kampf, which he in 1934 under the title Hitler, the political psychologist published. Hitler had told him in July 1932 in writing his joy that the first time his book will issue a lecture at a university. In the Nazi period, Poppelreuter operated as a consultant of the National Socialist German Institute for Technical Work Research and Training in D√ºsseldorf. In Bonn, he served as Deputy Chairman of Psychology at the German Society. Shortly before his death, occupational and partisan judicial proceedings had been initiated against him for alcohol abuse and reprehensible means in a divorce dispute. Contributions to psychology =Poppelreuter's law= Poppelreuter's Law is a law of physiological training that states that when teaching a skill requiring both speed and accuracy, it is better in the early stages to limit speed and practice until a certain degree of accuracy has been attained, and then gradually increase the speed.Hellebrandt, F. A. (1972). The physiology of motor learning. In R. N. Singer (Ed.), Readings in motor learning (pp. 397-409). Philadelphia, PA: Lea & Febiger. The law was invented and so named by Walther Poppelreuter in 1922. Subsequent research has invalidated the law, indicating that the neuromuscular patterns between the same activity performed slow and fast oftentimes are completely different and therefore unable to be trained simultaneously. =Poppelreuter figure visual perceptual function test= Poppelreuter overlapping figure Poppelreuter invented the overlapping figures test in 1917 as one method of assessing brain injury incurred during World War I. It is typical for people with apperceptive agnosia to have difficulty with the overlapping figures, but not for people with associative visual agnosia. Honors and criticism The Walther-Poppelreuter Medal was named in his honor. In addition, houses and streets were named after him. Poppelreuter's Nazi past was only noticed by the publication of a book on child euthanasia in the Bonn children's institution in the public consciousness. In 1990, Hannelore Kohl returned the Poppelreuter medal conferred in 1986. In the district of Cologne Ostheim, there was a Poppelreuter Street since 1957. Due to Poppelreuter's involvement in Nazism, the road was renamed Josef- Poppelreuter Street, after the first director of the Roman division of the Wallraf-Richartz Museum.

Sturzenegger has a PhD in Economics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was a professor of economics at University of California, Los Angeles, Torcuato di Tella University (where he also was Dean of the Business School), and Kennedy School of Government of Harvard University. Currently he teaches at University of San Andres and is Honoris Causa Professor at HEC Paris. Academically he co-introduced Dark Matter, a term referring to 'invisible' assets that explain the difference between official estimates of the current account and estimates based on the actual return net financial position as well as the concept of de facto exchange rates. Throughout his academic career he has published close to fifty articles in refereed journals as well as eight books. He was also Chief Economist of YPF, President of Bank of the City of Buenos Aires and a National Congressman for the PRO party. Career He graduated in 1987 with an Economics degree from the National University of La Plata. He earned his Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1991. Academics Between 1991 and 1994, Sturzenegger was an assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1998, Sturzenegger left his position in YPF and became Dean of the Business School at Torcuato di Tella University until the year 2001. In 2002, he returned to his previous occupation as Dean at Torcuato di Tella University until the year 2005. Between 2005 and 2007, Sturzenegger was a visiting professor of public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University. During the year 2005, he was selected as Young Global Leader in the World Economic Forum in Davos and in 2006 he was awarded the Konex Prize. Private sector He returned to Argentina in 1995 when Jos√© Estenssoro appointed him as Chief Economist of Yacimientos Petrol√≠feros Fiscales. Public sector In 2001, he interrupted his academic profession and decided to participate in the public sector as Secretary of Political Economy of Argentina during Cavallo's administration. In 2007 when Mauricio Macri, the mayor of the city of Buenos Aires, asked him to act as president of the Bank of the City of Buenos Aires he returned to Argentina. During his tenure, the bank made a big turnaround from losing 160 million Argentine pesos annualized during the six months previous to his appointment to becoming the most profitable state-owned firm in the country six years later with record profits of more than 1300 million Argentine pesos in 2013. His management of the bank became a Harvard case study. In 2013, Federico Sturzenegger resigned as president of Banco Ciudad to become a Member of the Chamber of Deputies.  Presidency at Central Bank  Between 10 December 2015 and 14 June 2018, he served as President of the Central Bank during Mauricio Macri's administration. Its management had three central objectives: build a monetary system more suitable for the country, develop the financial system and improve the means of payment technology.https://www.fsturzenegger.com.ar/biografia Once the exchange restrictions inherited from the previous administration have been eliminated, he established a inflation targeting regime with a floating exchange rate that generates a pronounced drop in inflation.http://www.bcra.gov.ar/Pdfs/Prensa_comunicacion/Metas_de_inflacion26092016.PDF Core inflation, in particular, by December 2017 had stabilized at an annualized value of 18%, with downward expectations. This disinflation process, in turn, occurred in a context of strong economic growth (the economy grew by in 2017). Even with these results in December 2017, the government decided to dismantle the system, which subsequently implied a process of increasing inflation, which motivated its departure shortly after.https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/yes-macri-failed-on-the- economy-but-it-wasnt-all-for-naught/https://www.brookings.edu/wp- content/uploads/2019/09/Sturzenegger_conference-draft.pdf Spread Country Risk (EMBI+) for Argentina. The red line marks the 28D event. To develop the financial system, he introduced the Purchasing Value Units (UVAS), deposits and credits that adjust for the price level, for the first time in decades, the development of long-term credit. The result was the highest credit growth in 20 years in 2017, with a real explosion in the mortgage loan segment, a process that has continued later. He also implemented a deep deregulation of bureaucratic restrictions that limits the potential growth of the financial sector.https://www.bcra.gob.ar/Noticias/BCRA_reglamenta_la_ampliacion_de_instrumentos_para_credito_y_ahorro.asp Regarding payment methods, he promotioned modern payment mechanisms such as PEI (Immediate electronic payment), mobile wallets, mobile payments, Debin, and homogenization of QR codes, which allow for accelerated growth of these alternative payment mechanisms. Likewise, it promoted the divestment of banks in the Prisma company (sole supplier of Visa in the country) in order to make the credit and debit card segment more competitive.https://www.bcra.gob.ar/noticias/PEI.asp  National Congress  Jury of Federico Sturzenegger as National Congressman As a Congressman, Federico Sturzenegger presented 11 bills and had numerous participations in the Chamber of Deputies. In the year 2014 he was 13¬∫ in a ranking of participation in sessions. In a session in which a bill proposed by the then Minister of Transportation Florencio Randazzo, that allowed \\"open access\\" to the railroad tracks for freight transport, the Congressman managed to include the transport for passengers in this project. The law in question makes available rail infrastructure, to be used by any company created to operate rail freight as well as by individual companies. The National government put this law in practice in 2018. One of the bills presented by Federico Sturzenegger was one that strived for universal and compulsory education since age 3. Soon after, the government presented a similar project which consisted of the obligation at 4 years of age. Sturzenegger argued that in many parts of the world it was shown that children who receive quality early education at the age of 3‚Äì4 years, had lower dropout rates, higher educational level completed, higher wages, better academic performance later, and a lower proportion of them was in the need to receive state social assistance plans.http://www.diputados.gov.ar/proyectos/proyecto.jsp?id=162165 As the former president of the Banco Ciudad he had a pending issue. After the so- called Conti Law, that took the judicial deposits from Banco Ciudad and transferred them to Banco Naci√≥n, he presented a project with the idea of allowing free competition between financial entities in order to attract these deposits, which would result in a higher level of service and better rates for the judicial deposits.http://www.diputados.gov.ar/proyectos/proyecto.jsp?id=171256 In December 2014 Sturzenegger presented a bill that consisted of implementing a loan scheme with the possibility of granting mortgage loans where the capital of the loan would move in line with the general level of inflation. The proposal was based on the Chilean model of indexed currency, using the Unidad de Fomento. According to the same project, implementing it would significantly reduce the interest rate on mortgage loans, approximating its value to a rental. As the value of capital is preserved, loans of 30 years or more would automatically would develop.http://www.diputados.gov.ar/proyectos/proyecto.jsp?id=171345 Later on, as Governor of the Central Bank he implemented this mechanism, and the result was a significant lending boom in mortgages which led to triple digit growth rates in mortgages. He also proposed eliminating the minimum prices for the airline industry (the Executive implemented this in 2018), implementing a transparent entry system for the public administration (he implemented such schemes both at Banco Ciudad as well as at the Central Bank), he proposed, following the guidelines of the OECD a project to make firms responsible for corruption (a similar law was approved in 2017), and he proposed a mechanism to ensure social aid beneficiaries not to lose their benefits as they transitioned to formal employment (the government implemented a similar scheme known as Plan Empalme in 2017). Management of Banco Ciudad New Headquarter of Banco Ciudad in Parque Patricios In February 2008 Sturzenegger was appointed president of the Banco Ciudad, a state owned bank property of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires. Before Sturzenegger's appointment the bank was losing money. In the second half of 2007 it had suffered losses over 80 million Argentine pesos. In 2013, after six years under Sturzenegger's management, the bank reached a record profit of more than 1300 million Argentine pesos, becoming the most profitable state owned company in Argentina. Between the years 2008 and 2012 the bank tripled its net worth and multiplied by 7 its loans to medium and small enterprises, by 6 its loans to large enterprises, and by 4 its mortgage loans.Stuzenegger, Federico. Yo no me quiero ir, Editorial Planeta, Buenos Aires, May 2013. Third Edition: Buenos Aires, June 2013. Chapter 9: La gesti√≥n de lo p√∫blico During Sturzenegger's management the bank became the only one in Argentina to offer a free savings account for all its clients, the only bank that had opened branches in shanty towns, and the only bank to offer loans (including mortgage loans) to people who earned the minimum wage. The bank also became known for pushing new alternatives for transportation, such as those that allowed the client to buy bicycles or for a taxi driver to buy his or her own cab. Sturzenegger's management is known for implementing a unique hiring system based in meritocratic results and inspired in the Brazilian Development Bank. The primary objective of this new system was to promote equal opportunities through a recruiting based on academic results. A first selection was made on academic grades. The preselected group of applicants had then to conduct another exam at the Universidad de Buenos Aires. Those who had studied in public schools were prioritized for the selection. By the year 2013 the bank was going to move its central headquarter to a new building designed by Norman Foster. The new headquarter was designed with construction standards that would make it the most sustainable public building in Latin America. Harvard Business School wrote a case study describing the renovation of Banco Ciudad and classifying Sturzeneggers management as one of the two most successful experiences of public company's transformation. Dark Matter Dark matter is a term coined by Sturzenegger and Ricardo Hausmann to refer to the 'invisible' assets that explain the difference between official estimates of the U.S. current account, and estimates based on the actual return on the U.S. net financial position. Specifically, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimated the net U.S. current account deficit to be 2.5 trillion in 2004. However, according to Sturzenegger and his colleague Ricardo Hausmann, the U.S. current account deficit cannot in reality be as high as it is estimated to be: otherwise, the U.S. would be paying large amounts of interests on its debt. This does not seem to be the case: net income in 2004 was still a positive 30 billion, which is not lower than it was in 1980, before the U.S. built up its current account deficit. Thus, the authors argue that the \\"real\\" cumulative current account between 1980 and 2004 had in fact been positive, and that somehow a large amount of (foreign) assets are being left out of the calculations. The suggested source of this \\"missing wealth\\" is dark matter, resulting from the unaccounted export of ideas and other services (such as insurance or liquidity) from the U.S. to other economies. The two authors claim that the U.S. has significant exports, mainly of business know-how bundled with its Foreign direct investment, that do not show up in official trade statistics. These exports increase the real value of its foreign assets, and thus lower the real size of the deficit. Therefore, they argue, there is less reason to worry about the U.S. financial position than is usually assumed. In addition, this dark matter in the U.S. current account also has implications for the accounts of other countries, which have been inadvertently accruing liabilities by importing know-how. The idea of dark matter has not gone without criticism. First, Willem Buiter has argued that dark matter should result in a higher rate of return on U.S. external assets than on U.S. external liabilities. However, he claims, there is no convincing evidence that this is the case. Second, the U.S. income from dark matter seems to vary enormously from year to year, even though it stems from permanent characteristics of the U.S. economy like the export of know-how. Lastly, Mathew Higgins, Thomas Klitgaard, and Cedric Tille agree with the assertion that U.S. foreign assets are currently undervalued. However, they argue that more important, U.S. foreign liabilities are overvalued. Thus, The U.S. has fewer foreign liabilities than is currently assumed; this fact (rather than dark matter) explains the unexpectedly high net income. In a 2007 article, Hausmann and Sturzenegger respond to some of these critiques, defending the existence and function of dark matter. De Facto Exchange Rate Regimes: Deeds vs Words In a joint work with Eduardo Levy Yeyati, Federico Sturzenegger developed a popular classification of exchange rate regimes de facto in the paper \\"Classyfing Exchange Rate Regimes: Deeds vs. Words\\". Stuzenegger and Levy Yeyati sustained that most of the empirical literature on exchange rate regimes were using the IMF de jure classification based on regime announced by the governments, despite the recognized inconsistencies between reported and actual policies in many cases. Many countries that in theory had a flexible exchange rate intervened in exchange markets so pervasively that in practice very little difference existed (in terms of observable performance) with countries that have explicit fixed exchange rate regimes. Conversely, periodic devaluations of pegs in inflation-prone countries were the result of the implementations of monetary policies that were inconsistent with fixed exchange rates and that made the effective regime resemble a flexible arrangement. Moreover, countries that appeared to behave according to the declared regime during tranquil times could be tempted to change their course of action once the regime was under stress. Thus, a very different picture of exchange rate regime choices might have appeared once the international context became more volatile. The authors proposed a new de facto classification of exchange rate regimes that reflected the actual rather than the announced policies, providing an alternative as well as a complement to the standard de jure approach. Sturzenegger and Levy Yeyati managed to define the exchange rate regimes according to the behavior of three classification variables: changes in the nominal exchange rate, the volatility of these changes, and the volatility of international reserves. Underlying the selection of these variables they made a textbook definition of exchange rate regimes, where fixed exchange rate regimes were associated with changes in international reserves aimed at reducing the volatility in the nominal exchange rate, and flexible exchange rates were characterized by substantial volatility in nominal rates with relatively stable reserves. Thus, the combined behavior of these three classifications was sufficient to determine the regime to which each country belonged at any point in time.

When a genetic mutation or genotype in one locus results in a phenotype similar to one that is known to be caused by another mutation or genotype in another locus, it is said to be a genocopy. However, genocopies may also be referred to as \\"genetic mimics\\", in which the same mutation or specific genotype can result in two unique phenotypes in two different patients. The term ‚ÄúGenocopy‚Äù was coined by Dr. H. Nachstheim in 1957, in which he discusses ‚Äúfalse‚Äù phenocopies. In comparison to when a phenotype is the result of an environmental condition that had the same effect as a previously known genetic factor such as mutation. While offspring may inherit specific mutations or genotypes that result in genocopies, phenocopies are not heritable. Two types of elliptocytosis that are genocopies of each other, but are distinguished by the fact that one is linked to the Rh blood group locus and the other is not. The way to distinguish a recessive genocopy from a phenotype caused by a different allele would be by carrying out a test cross, breeding the two together, if they F1 hybrid segregates 1:2:1 then we can determine that it was a genocopy. Examples =Mitochondrial diseases= Since Mitochondria carry out such a variety of functions in different tissues, there are often hundreds of Mitochondrial diseases that might be harder to diagnose in early stages. Considering that there is a complex relationship between cells and genes to have metabolism at its optimum, identical Mitochondrial DNA mutations may not show up as identical diseases. Genocopies are often seen as diseases that might be caused by the same mutation but do not result in identical expression. Diseases associated with mtDNA are often as a result of mutations in tRNA that play a role in Mitochondrial protein synthesis. These mutations that change protein-encoding genes or both. How each category of cause of Mitochondrial disease produces genocopies is still unknown. =DiGeorge syndrome= The genocopy event between TBX1 and 22q11.2 mutations is one that shows grave symptoms. The 22q11.2 mutation leads to DiGeorge or velocardiofacial syndromes. Similarly, the mutations in the TBX1 genome exhibit the same symptoms. The TBX1 haploinsufficiency is responsible for many of the traits that are also seen in 22q11.2 mutations. It has 2 mutations that are similar to the two mutations of 22q11.2 - deletion and duplication. The first mutation is L411P and is a de novo mutation. This mutation affects a conserved amino acid within a putative transactivation domain and is likely to affect the protein's functionality. The second mutation is one that converts a cytosine to thymine in the 5‚Äô UTR region of the TBX1 gene. This mutation increases TBX1 translational efficiency during key points in development, which is the functional equivalent to 22q11.2 duplication. This shows us that genocopy is not just a discrete genomic event but can also be seen in serious diseases.

It is located at an elevation of 416 meters above sea level. Ibokun is the headquarters of Obokun Local Government Area, Osun State. The postal code of the area is 233. Its coordinates are 7¬∞46'6\\" N and 4¬∞43'0\\" E in DMS (Degrees Minutes Seconds) or 7.78333 and 4.71667 (in decimal degrees). History Ibokun previously known as Ilemure was named after the warrior that delivered the town from attacks of the neighborhood warriors such as Alare- the paramount ruler of the then Ilare town. It was believed that Obokun migrated from Ife as the youngest son of Oduduwa. He, alone of all Oduduwa sons, volunteered to go and fetch sea water to cure his father's blindness of old age which translated to Obokun in Yoruba language that is someone who fetches okun- sea water. On his return he was told his father was dead, and he asked for his \\"portion\\" of his inheritances. He was told that all inheritances including crowns were given to his elder brothers. Instead he was given a sword‚ÄìIda Ajase (sword of conquest) and told to seize his heritage from his elder brothers. On his conquest tours, he got to Ilemure now Ibokun where he met Ita on ground during one of the festive periods, Obokun was ceremoniously welcomed and he requested the host should extend the celebration with drums and dancing which was against the rules of the land- Ibokun by the neighbour \\"super master\\". The host danced to the tunes of Obokun's instruction which eventually led to several wars and Obokun conquered. Ita Adeforitikun (the host) later appealed to Obokun to stay in the town (Ilemure)but gave him a place to build his own house. Ajibogun (Obokun) accepted the offer and Ita gave him one of the three traditional crowns he brought from Ile-Ife because Obokun did not meet anything at his arrival from the seas. Ita gave his first son Agaba-Ogo one of the two remaining crowns and sent him to Mesi-Oloja (now Imesi-Ile) to become their ruler and the third crown he gave to his second son who succeeded him as the head (the ruler and spiritual leader) of Ilemure, Ooyelagbo(abbreviated as Ooyela). The town was gradually changed to Ibokun after the demise of Ita by people who were referring to the town as 'Ilu Eni to bu Okun'meaning the town of the 'brine fetcher'. From Ilu Obokun to Ilu'bokun and eventually to Ibokun. It is of note that the only direct son of Obokun was the man called Olabusuke Obarabara Olokun-Esin who was later taken out of Ibokun by Obokun because he did not trust the people. Olabusuke later became Owa of Ilesa (king of Ilesa) and by extension of the whole Ijesaland. The person appointed by Obokun when he became old was Adelowo Ajangbodorigi-Efon to act as surrogate ruler for him and his descendant overs the territory given to him by Ita. The descendants and successors of Adelowo later transmuted to Ogboni of Ibokun or 'Ba'bokun.< Reliable Oral History and The History of Yorubas by Reerend Johnson > Economy and occupation The people of Ibokun were predominantly farmers who specialised in growing food crops such as Yam, Cassava, Maize, Rice and so on as well as Cash crops such as Cocoa, Kolanut and so on. However, the thrust of commerce is central to their activities and they participate in trading activities mostly across the Western and the Northern part of Nigeria.

KiKa, the children's channel jointly owned by European Broadcasting Union (EBU) members ARD and ZDF, selected Susan Oseloff as the first representative of Germany. Her song, ‚ÄúStronger with You‚Äù, was written by singer-songwriter Levent Geiger, a finalist in the German children's show ' in 2015 and 2019. History Germany was originally going to take part in the contest in Copenhagen, but later withdrew from the contest. They also planned to take part in the contest in Lillehammer but again withdrew from the contest. In addition, NDR also broadcast the , and contests. For 2003, the broadcaster organised a delayed broadcast on KiKa whilst the contests in 2015 and 2016 were livestreamed via the broadcaster's Eurovision Song Contest website eurovision.de with commentary provided by Thomas Mohr. In May 2014, NDR announced they would not debut at the contest as they believed the contest would not be a success under German television marketing standards. They did, however, observe the contest in Kyiv, Ukraine. ZDF attended the 2014 Contest in Malta. On 1 July 2015, ARD consortium member NDR launched an online poll to decide whether or not Germany should participate in the contest, which would be broadcast on their children's station, KiKa (a joint venture of ARD and ZDF). Germany ultimately did not participate. In December 2019, KiKA confirmed that a delegation from the broadcaster and NDR was attending the contest in Gliwice, Poland to experience the competition as part of the audience. It was emphasised that no decision had yet been made as to whether Germany would participate the following year or not although there were close discussions with the EBU. On 8 July 2020, KiKA confirmed that a delgation from broadcasters NDR and ZDF will participate for the first time in the contest in Warsaw. Participation For the nation's first participation, the broadcasters selected their artist through the national selection process Dein Song f√ºr Warschau (English: Your song for Warsaw), with the song selected internally. KiKa opened the application window for the national selection show on 8 July until 31 July for children of age 9 to 14.

Unraced as a two-year-old, he was trained in France in 1976 and 1977 before being transferred to race the United Kingdom in 1978 and 1979. A specialist stayer, he overcame serious physical problems to win several major long-distance races including the Prix du Cadran (twice), Prix de Barbeville, Prix Jean Prat, Doncaster Cup, Jockey Club Cup and Henry II Stakes. He was also the beaten favourite in three successive runnings of the Ascot Gold Cup. After his retirement from racing, he became a very successful sire of National Hunt horses. Background Buckskin was a \\"lengthy\\" bay horse with a small white star and a white sock on his right hind foot bred by Dayton Ltd. the breeding company of his owner Daniel Wildenstein. His sire Yelapa won the Grand Crit√©rium in 1968 and stood as a breeding stallion in France for three years with moderate results before being exported to Japan in 1973. Buckskin's dam Bete a Bon Dieu (French for Ladybird) was an unraced daughter of Herbager. Buckskin was sent into training with the Argentinian Angel Penna Sr.. Penna trained may of Wildenstein's best horses including Allez France, Crow, Flying Water and Pawneese. Racing career =1976: three-year-old season= Buckskin was slow to mature and did not run in public until the autumn of his three-year-old season. After finishing unplaced on his debut, he won two minor races in the French provinces over distances of 2100 and 2800 metres. At the end of the season, it appeared likely that the colt's future career would be in hurdle races. =1977: four-year-old season= Buckskin began the 1977 season at √âvry in March, and won a handicap race over 2800 metres by five lengths. On 3 April, the colt was moved up in class for the Group Three Prix de Barbeville over 3100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in which he was opposed by the double Ascot Gold Cup winner Sagaro. Ridden by Yves Saint-Martin, he started the 2.6/1 second favourite and, according to Timeform, \\"slaughtered\\" the field, winning by twenty lengths from Sagaro, who was in turn eight lengths clear of the other runners. Three weeks later, Buckskin and Sagaro met again in the Prix Jean Prat (now the Prix Vicomtesse Vigier) over the same course and distance. On this occasion, Buckskin started the 1/5 favourite and again won easily, although the margin of victory was only four lengths. Buckskin had been receiving weight from Sagaro on the first two meetings, but when the two met next, in the Group One Prix du Cadran over 4000 metres a month later, it was at level weights. Starting the 3/10 favourite, Buckskin was headed by his rival 300 metres from the finish, but rallied to regain the lead in the closing stages and won by half a length. In June, Buckskin was sent to England and started favourite for the Ascot Gold Cup, but was beaten five lengths by Sagaro who was being ridden for the first time that year by Lester Piggott, leading to speculation that he needed soft ground to produce his best form. He was less successful when brought back to shorter distances, finishing unplaced in the Prix Kergorlay at Deauville Racecourse in August, having twisted a plate in the race and then running third in Preis von Europa over 2400 metres in Germany. He returned to 4000 metres for the Prix Gladiateur at Longchamp in October, but looked unimpressive before the race and finished third behind the British-trained gelding John Cherry. =1978: five-year-old season= In 1978, Buckskin was moved to England to be trained by Peter Walwyn near Lambourn in Berkshire. Walwyn found that the horse had foot problems which made him difficult to train and on his debut for his new handler, Buckskin was disappointing, being well-beaten by Shangamuzo in the inaugural running of the Sagaro Stakes at Ascot in April. Buckskin was fitter when he returned to France three weeks later for his second Prix du Cadran, for which he started favourite and won easily by three lengths from Duky and Hawkberry. At Ascot in June he started 11/8 favourite for the Gold Cup, with his main opposition expected to come from Shangamuzo and the Park Hill Stakes winner Royal Hive. Ridden by Pat Eddery, Buckskin turned into the straight in second place but then faded and finished fourth behind Shangamuzo, Royal Hive and Hawkberry. After the race Wildenstein was highly critical of Eddery, describing him as \\"a boy\\" who would never ride for him again, and saying that if Saint-Martin or Lester Piggott had ridden the horse he would have won the race. Walwyn came to the defence of his jockey and shortly afterwards, Wildenstein removed Buckskin from Walwyn's stable and sent him to be trained by Henry Cecil at Newmarket. Buckskin's training problems worsened, as his flat feet and weak suspensory ligaments made him an extremely fragile horse and in all his subsequent races he appeared with heavily bandaged forelegs. In September he faced a rematch with Shangamuzo in the Doncaster Cup over two and a quarter miles. Ridden by Joe Mercer and starting at odds of 5/2 he took the lead in the straight and drew away from his opponents to win by eight lengths, with Billion taking second ahead of Shangamuzo and Sea Pigeon. Timeform described the performance as \\"overwhelming\\". Three weeks later Buckskin ended his season with a win in the Jockey Club Cup at Newmarket Racecourse, beating Shangamuzo by eight lengths. =1979: six-year-old season= Despite fears that his legs and feet would not stand up to further training, Buckskin returned as a six-year-old with the Ascot Gold Cup as his objective. He was never allowed to go at full speed in home gallops and poultices were applied to his legs after every piece of work. It was decided that he would have only one preparatory race and that, win-or-lose, the Gold Cup would be his last appearance on the racecourse. Buckskin prepared for the Gold Cup in the Henry II Stakes on soft ground at Sandown Park Racecourse in May. Ridden by Mercer, and starting at odds of 10/11 he drew away from the field in the straight and won by fifteen lengths from Pragmatic (winner of the Yorkshire Cup) and Arapahos. After the race Cecil warned that the horse had only a fifty per cent chance of appearing at Ascot. In June Buckskin favourite for the Gold Cup as he had done for the two previous years. Mercer opted to ride the horse in preference to the stable's other runner Le Moss, a four-year-old who had finished second in the St Leger and was partnered by Lester Piggott. Looking somewhat uncomfortable on the firmer ground, Buckskin took the lead half a mile from the finish but was unable to establish a decisive advantage and was challenged in the straight by Le Moss. The stable companions raced together until the final furlong, when Buckskin was eased down by Mercer and finished second, beaten seven lengths by his younger rival. After the race, Cecil virtually ignored the winner, being much more concerned with the condition of the runner-up. In his 1983 memoir On The Level Cecil said that Buckskin's defeat made him \\"feel like Judas Iscariot\\". Assessment In 1977, the independent Timeform organisation gave Buckskin a rating of 130, three pounds behind Sagaro and seven behind their Horse of the Year Alleged. In the inaugural International Classification, he was rated the equal of Sagaro as the sixth-best horse of any age in Europe, behind Alleged, Blushing Groom, The Minstrel, Balmerino and Orange Bay. Buckskin was named the Champion Stayer of 1977 in the Gilbey Champion racehorse awards, which were decided on points awarded for performances in major races. In the following year, Buckskin was Timeform's best stayer, with a rating of 133. He was rated the fifth-best horse in Europe by the International Classification, behind Alleged, Ile de Bourbon, Acamas and Shirley Heights. In 1979, Buckskin was rated on 131 by Timeform, placing him alongside Le Moss as the year's best stayer. In the International Classification he was rated two pounds below Le Moss and seven pounds below the top-rated older horse, Ile de Bourbon. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Buckskin the best British-trained racehorse foaled in 1973. Henry Cecil described Buckskin as \\"the greatest and bravest horse I've trained\\". Stud record Buckskin was retired from racing after his defeat in the 1979 Gold Cup and began his career as a breeding stallion in 1980 at the Fawley Stud near Wantage in Oxfordshire at a fee of ¬£1,500. He had little impact as a sire of flat racers but was much more successful as a sire of National Hunt horses in Ireland. The most successful of his offspring was Amberleigh House the winner of the 2004 Grand National. He also sired Colonel Braxton (Deloitte Novice Hurdle), Black Humour, Minella Lad, Micko's Dream (Thyestes Chase, Fortria Chase), Givus A Buck (National Hunt Handicap Chase), Hidebound (Kennel Gate Novices' Hurdle), Ebony Light (Peter Marsh Chase) and Buck Rogers (John Durkan Memorial Punchestown Chase). Buckskin died in 1995 at the age of twenty-two.

Through a series of photographic essays, objects, and installations, Landgraf celebrates Native Hawaiian culture while also addressing the legacies of colonialism and its impact on indigenous Hawaiian rights, value and history. While her work often centers on the negative impacts of land use and development, she also alludes to the resilience of the land and the indigenous population. Landgraf says about her work, \\"Although much of my work laments the violations on the Hawaiian people, land and natural resources, it also offers hope with allusions to the strength and resilience of Hawaiian land and its people.‚Äù Landgraf's most recent work combines photographic series with objects and installations. She received a BA in anthropology from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1989 and an MFA in Visual Arts from the Vermont College of Fine Arts in 1995.Kapulani Community College She currently teaches in the Arts and Humanities department at Kapiolani Community College in Honolulu, HI. In her 1994 book, NƒÅ Wahi Pana O Ko'olau Poko: Legendary Places of Ko'olau Poko, Landraf refutes the tradition of landscape photography of Hawaiian spaces, instead linking place to native Hawaiian ways of knowing and understanding the sacred. In her book, Asian Settler Colonialism From Local Governance to the Habits of Everyday Life in Hawaii, Landgraf describes the history of colonisation in Hawaii, and the effects it has had on the identity of Kanaka Maoli people. Her work is political in nature, emphasizing Hawaiian claims to land and speaks against the continued commodification of the islands by settler groups. Landgraf's work has toured across the United States in the Changing Hands: Art Without Reservation collection. In 2013 Landgraf was awarded the Native Arts and Culture Foundation fellowship. Upon receipt of this award, Landgraf remarked, \\"The Native Arts and Cultures Artist Fellowship validated artwork created by a Native Hawaiian artist working in Hawai'i on a national scale [...] I hope the national award brings a greater awareness and interest to the realities and injusticies, which continue to occur in Hawai'i and within the Native Hawaiian community. I also hope it inspires and instigates younger Native Hawaiian artists to go beyond the decorative ‚Äì to give voice and challenge ‚Äì to push the boundaries ‚Äì to make people think.\\" During the 2013 NACF Artists fellowship in Visual Arts, Landgraf showcased an artwork that spelled out LANI(sky).\\"In 2013 the Honolulu Museum of Art exhibited Ponoiwi, a solo exhibition which takes a stand against the decades-long practice of removing sand from Hawaiian beaches, which often desecrates native burial cites.

He lives in La√¢youne. Biography Mohammed Tamim is from a family with origins in Chinguetti, Mauritania. After primary school studies at the Catholic school Charles de Foucauld, followed by Lyc√©e Lyautey in Casablanca, Mohammed Tamim enrolled at Gesamthochschule Kassel in Germany, graduating as an architect-engineer. After several months working in civil service in Al Hoce√Øma (Morocco), he was recruited to serve as municipal architect for the city of La√¢youne. During a university project studying the shantytown (or bidonville) Benmsik in Casablanca, he discovered that the term bidonville was first utilized in Morocco. He later discovered that the origins of this type of living environment, among other characteristics of the Third World, can be first found in England during the Industrial Revolution. Architectural Work Mohammed Tamim visiting construction of a school complex in Laayoune As an architect working in La√¢youne, Mohammed Tamim focused on restructuring the city's former colonial quarters known as Colomina; safeguarding the region's historical patrimony through the preservation of churches in La√¢youne and Dakhla; and the preservation of sites of Sahrawi cultural heritage such as Zawiya Shaykh Malainine. He also built many schools, both public and private. More recently, he committed his association SaharaGreen to the development of renewable energy in the Saharan provinces. (See photos.) Theses on Economic Development The origin and definition of developing countries: like Walt Whitman Rostow, Mohammed Tamim believes that, beginning with the Industrial Revolution in England during the 18th and 19th centuries, developing countries can be defined as countries in transition from various traditional ways of life toward the modern way of life. * Development indicator: The development of a country can be measured by its level of modern education. The level of school enrollment is proportional to the level of economic development and is inversely proportional to the level of demographic growth. Economic development here being measured by the proportion of the labor force active in modern sectors, as well as life expectancy. * Demographic growth: Triggered by vaccination campaigns, demographic growth constituted a major obstacle to the generalization of school enrollment in developing countries and, by association, to development itself. * The condition of possibility for Walt Whitman Rostow's Take Off: The economic take-off of developing countries requires the generalization of school enrollment from primary school through university. * The foresight of leaders: The Meiji Emperor was the first great strategist of development in history. The success of development politics depends upon the foresight of leaders such as Habib Bourguiba in Tunisia, Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore, Deng Xiaoping in China, Mahathir Mohamad in Malaysia, Park Chung-hee in South Korea, Seretse Khama and Ketumile Masire in Botswana, Paul Kagame in Rwanda, etc. * The strategy of universal development: The generalization of education and to that end, birth control. * UN reform, the chance or the international community: The chance may wear at the head of each developing country a man of vision and integrity. But these probabilities are negligible. Such a strategy can only be realized through universal solidarity, such as UN reform. Themes in Literary Work Through the following works of literature, Mohammed Tamim has illustrated the principle themes of his economic research on development : * The overpopulation of shantytowns is illustrated by L'√©trange histoire de Maria D., a play that follows the travails of Maria, a young woman living in a bidonville and pregnant with her seventh child. * Immigration and racism in Ulrich, l'histoire d'un Arabe n√©onazi, the story of a blond Arab fascinated by Nazi ideology who establishes and leads a neo-Nazi organization. * Development politics in The G√©n√©ral Kanem-Bornous, ou l'Afrique est bien partie, the story of an African general who, thanks to an effective development policy, transforms his territory into a highly developed region despite his country's president, a corrupt psychopath who confuses Whites with Albino blacks. * Corruption and poor governance in La√¢youne-Plage. * The study of Islamist movements in Le specter de l'islamisme. * Homosexuality in a religious world in Nabil Haddad. * The difficulty of growing old and losing one's youth and beauty in Alain Ledon, etc. The first chapters of each of these works can be read on his site: www.mohammedtamim.net.

Formerly published by Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen, it is owned and published by Sanoma after the latter took over VNU's magazine division. Established in 1938, Margriet was at one point the women's magazine with the highest circulation in the country, when it was read by more than a million women every week. For the first four years it was written almost in its entirety by one woman, Alma van Eysden-Peeren. During the late 1960s the magazine, influenced by feminism, became well known for its incorporation of emancipatory content (sometimes controversially so). Its polls among women readers asked questions that at the time were groundbreaking for such a mainstream, large-circulation magazine and it participated in feminist action. History =First decades: 1938 - 1960s= The magazine's first issue appeared on 30 September 1938, and was published by the Ge√Øllustreerde Pers. The \\"weekly for women and girls\\" was at first an appendix for the family magazine De week in beeld, and was not published independently until 1942. The name's origin (\\"Margriet\\" is both a girl's and a flower's name in Dutch) is unknown. For its first four years, Margriet was the creation of one single woman, Alma van Eysden-Peeren; occasionally she wrote content under the pseudonym Els van Duin, to give the impression that there was a staff of writers and editors. While she wrote the entire magazine, she was never in charge; until the early 1960s the editor-in-chief was Anton Weehuizen, also editor-in-chief of the Ge√Øllustreerde Pers. Van Eysden-Peeren was active with the magazine until the 1960s, and she was a longtime respondent for the advice column \\"Margriet weet raad\\".In the 1970s the column provided the material for a sociological investigation into shifting standards for morality and civility. See El 46. Initially Margriet was sober and simple: published in black and white and of modest length, it already featured the content that was to be its success formula for years to come: recipes, articles on child care and motherhood, sewing patterns, letters and questions to the editors, interviews, and regular columns.H√ºlsken 59. In April 1943, during World War II, the German occupiers closed down the magazine. Margriet survived the war and resumed publication in November 1945, with Princess Margriet of the Netherlands on the cover of the first new issue. The magazine returned to weekly publication in 1949, and in 1948 incorporated the magazine Moeder en kind (\\"mother and child\\") and in 1950 Cinderella. The first issue of Donald Duck, a weekly comic book with Disney characters, was distributed free with Margriet on 25 October 1952. The magazine's biggest growth took place in this period, between 1949 and 1953; around 1950 it had some 500,000 subscribers. Until the mid-1960s it remained mainstream, and was characterized by modesty, deference, and a sense of duty. =Emancipation: 1960s - 1970s= Under a new editor, Joop Swart, Margriet acquired a more journalistic character in the mid-1960s, a time of increased wealth and socio-economic changes in the country. By 1965, it reached the height of its circulation, with 800,000 paying subscribers.H√ºlsken 61. In the second half of the 1960s, the magazine held a series of reader polls that aimed to give insight into the private life of the Dutch. By the late 1960s Margriet (as well as other women's magazines such as Libelle) started publishing articles and series reflective of the changing roles for women in society; an emancipatory series in 1967, for instance, called \\"Tomorrow's woman\\", was justified by reference to the revolutionary times.Meijer 47. The feminist group Dolle Mina, however, was dissatisfied, and considered the magazine still too old-fashioned and conformist. On 20 February 1970 they occupied the publisher's headquarters,Meijer 310. bringing cleaning supplies to clean the offices since, they claimed, that was all women were supposed to do according to the magazine. In truth, Margriet was much more progressive than it was given credit for and could be considered a proto-Opzij; in 1969, for instance, it had held and published a survey about sexuality, \\"Sex in Nederland\\" (one of its conclusions was that 60,000 married women had homosexual feelings,Meijer 180.) and had begun publishing articles on emancipation and other modern topics. The magazine took the initiative for a large-scale feminist event, November 1970's Op de vrouw af!, which it organized with a number of other organizations, most notably the feminist group Man Vrouw Maatschappij, but also Dolle Mina‚Äîa later poll showed that most people believed it was a Dolle Mina event.Meijer 169, 320. It published articles arguing the need for free and legal abortion, which caused the Secretary of Health to call the editor- in-chief into his office, since articles with such content, he explained, were to appear in medical journals only. In 1972 it became the first Dutch magazine with a woman as editor-in-chief, when Hanny van den Horst, who had been with the magazine since 1945, was appointed to the position.

Description Size comparison Like V. cuneata, V. rectangulata has a body composed of two distinct parts of approximately equal length. The anterior part is oval to rectangular in shape, enclosed by a carapace-like structure of four rigid cuticular plates fused together, with a small mouth at the front end: there is a keel-like extension of the body wall on the top and belly. Unlike in V. cuneata, the mouth region does not protrude out. The tail-like posterior section is slender, strongly cuticularised and placed dorsally. Paired openings connecting the pharynx to the outside run down the sides. These features are interpreted as possible primitive gill slits. Vetulicola rectangulata could be up to 7 cm long, and up to 4 cm in height (most specimens being 3.6 cm high). Lifestyle It is assumed that V. rectangulata spent most or all of its time swimming in the water column. Sediment found within the gut suggest that it was a deposit-feeder, possibly swimming to and from favorable feeding sites. At least one specimen has an individual of the putative entoproct, Cotyledion tyloides attached to the terminal segment of the tail. References Butterfield, Nicholas J. 2003.

Organised by Alternativ stad (the Stockholm branch of Friends of the Earth), the dispute centred on the planned destruction of 13 Scots elm trees located at the entrance to the Kungstr√§dg√•rden metro station in Kungstr√§dg√•rden, Stockholm, Sweden. The Stockholm city council, supported by the Swedish government, proposed cutting down the trees to prevent damage to the nearby subway. The Elm Conflict led to an examination of the need for citizens to have more input into the decision-making process of the city council, and received significant attention in Sweden's national media.Abstract in English of Daniel Helld√©n, Demokratin utmanas: almstriden och det politiska etablissemanget . Stockholm studies in politics, Stockholm 2005. Retrieved 2 June 2014. Background In 1970, subway construction workers found a crack in the subway structure in the vicinity of the Scots elms. Officials decided that undertaking repairs would be too difficult, so they proposed cutting down the trees and placing the entrance to the new subway station at that location. Stockholm parks manager Holger Blom noted that because of their age, the trees would not last much longer regardless. Stockholm politicians and technicians tried to persuade the citizens via an advertising campaign that the trees needed to be removed. The city council voted 63 to 34 in favour of removing the trees. On 23 April 1971, Prime Minister Olof Palme's government approved the final plans for the new subway station at Kungstr√§dg√•rden. Protests On 12 May, nearly 1,000 citizens of Stockholm gathered in a demonstration against the removal of the Scots elms. Protest tents were erected in the vicinity of the trees. The protests were well-organised. The protesters made phone lists (an early form of the smart mob technique of public mobilisation) in case the police entered the tent camps. Some people climbed the trees to deter workers from chopping them down. The situation escalated when government officials started chainsawing the trees under the protection of police. At one point, officers on horseback charged the demonstrators. Singer Cornelis Vreeswijk was present at the protest, singing songs and offering support. The protests were covered extensively in the press. Aftermath Marks from a chainsaw are still visible in 2011, 40 years after the event. The protesters were criticised in the media for being uncivil and undemocratic. As a result of the protests, the entry to the new subway station was moved east to a private property at Arsenalgatan 10. Most of the Scots elms remain at the site , though a few were chopped down by government officials before the protesters stopped further work.

The Doscuri are depicted as a Janiform head on the obverse. The reverse shows a galley, a reference to Telegonus, son of Ulysses and founder of Tusculum. The gens Fonteia was a plebeian family at Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned toward the end of the third century BC; Titus Fonteius was a legate of Publius Cornelius Scipio during the Second Punic War. The first of the Fonteii to obtain the consulship was Gaius Fonteius Capito, consul suffectus in 33 BC.Marcus Tullius Cicero, Pro Domo Sua 44.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor. Origin In his oration, Pro Fonteio, Cicero mentions that the Fonteii came originally from Tusculum, of which municipium it was one of the most distinguished families. The Fonteii claimed descent from Fontus, the son of Janus. A two-faced head appears on a coin of Gaius Fonteius, which Jean Foy Vaillant and others suppose to be the head of Janus, in reference to this tradition. But as Janus is always represented in later times with a beard, Eckhel maintains that the two heads refer to the Dioscuri, who were worshipped at Tusculum with especial honours, and who may be regarded as the Di Penates of the gens. Michael Crawford likewise favours a depiction of the Dioscuri, instead of Fontus, as they appear on other coins of the Fonteii.Marcus Tullius Cicero, Pro Fonteio 14.Arnobius, Adversus Gentes iii. 29.Jean Foy-Vaillant, Numismata Imperatorum Romanorum (1674).Joseph Hilarius Eckhel, Doctrina Numorum Veterum vol. v. p. 214 ff.Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, pp. 304, 305. Praenomina Denarius of Manius Fonteius, 108-107 BC. The obverse depicts the heads of the Dioscuri. The reverse reuses Telegonus' galley as on the denarius of Gaius Fonteius.The Fonteii used the praenomina Titus, Publius, Marcus, Gaius, Manius, and Lucius. Branches and cognomina The Fonteii bore the cognomens Agrippa, Balbus, and Capito, which is the only cognomen which occurs on coins of this gens. The cognomen Crassus is an error of the manuscripts, since there were no Fonteii Crassi. The Fonteii Balbi were not related to the other Fonteii as an inscription found in Etruria tells that they belonged to the tribe Sabatina ‚Äì prevalent in this area ‚Äì whilst the other Fonteii were from Tusculum, associated with the tribe Papiria.Cicero, Pro Fonteio, 41.Taylor, pp. 179, 214, 215, 273 (Papiria), 274 (Sabatina). Members Denarius of Manius Fonteius, 85 BC. The obverse depicts Apollo, as told by the monogram below his chin. The reverse shows a Bacchic scene, with Cupid riding a goat. Another reference to Tusculum is made with the caps of the Dioscuri above them. * Titus Fontieus was legate of Publius Cornelius Scipio in Spain, BC 212. After Scipio's defeat and death, the soldiers chose Lucius Marcius to lead them, in place of Fonteius, who was the senior officer of the legions. However, Fonteius remained second in command, and if he is the same Fonteius mentioned by Frontinus, he was a brave, if not an able officer.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita xxv. 32, 34, 38, xxvi. 17Sextus Julius Frontinus, Strategemata i. 5. ¬ß 12, iv. 5. ¬ß 8. * Marcus Fonteius, praetor of Sardinia, BC 166.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita xlv. 44.Broughton, vol.

The object was to permit Clodius, a patrician, to pass over to the plebeians and serve as tribune of the plebs. The adoption, though illegal and absurd, was passed in BC 60, and Fonteius' first and only paternal act was to emancipate his adopted son.Marcus Tullius Cicero, Pro Domo Sua 13; De Haruspicum Responsis 27. * Fonteius Magnus, probably a native of Bithynia, was a pleader of causes, and one of the accusers of Varenus Rufus for extortion while proconsul of Bithynia.

The railway line itself still exists as the Ohai branch line, but the ORB was dissolved in 1990. The Ohai line is one of the few remaining rural branch lines out of many that once existed throughout New Zealand.  History  = Construction = In the 1870s, coal was discovered in Ohai. Mines opened in the area, mostly with own 2 ft gauge railways to carry coal. The Ohai State Coal Mines was formed. Coal production boomed in the area in 1882 when a private railway was built by the Nightcaps Coal Company from the terminus of the New Zealand Government Railways Wairio Branch at Wairio to Nightcaps to provide more efficient transport of coal. In 1916 a proposal was made to build another line to coal interests around Ohai. The construction of this line was fiercely opposed by the Nightcaps Coal Company, fearing a loss of business. The Ohai Railway Board (ORB) was formed under the District Railways Act 1877. Much like the Port Chalmers Railway Company Limited in Dunedin, the ORB was formed with the backing of local government, and because the government declined to extend its line. In the case of the ORB, this was the railway line from Wairio to the new coalfields at Ohai. Local landowners funded the extension through mortgages against their own properties. After two Royal Commissions, construction was approved in July 1919 with a deviation through Morley Village, considered part of Nightcaps. The first section of the line, including the part serving Morley Village, opened on 1 September 1920. Ohai was reached four years later. The Nightcaps Coal Company ceased to operate, and they handed over their railway line to the Railways Department, who dismantled it in 1926 as the Ohai branch line was capable of catering for traffic from Nightcaps. In 1932, Parliament passed a local enactment for the ORB, the Ohai Railway Board Act 1932. In 1934, this line was further extended beyond Ohai to Birchwood, but the terminus was reverted to Ohai. = Demise = Economic reform in the 1980s ultimately led to the demise of the ORB. One of the ORB's members, the State Mines Department, became Coal Corporation on 1 April 1987. According to one source, the Coal Corporation and the New Zealand Railways Corporation (NZR) \\"put pressure\\" on the ORB to amalgamate with NZR. Following the 1989 local government reforms the Wallace County Council was amalgamated into the Southland County Council, forming the Southland District Council. The District Council took over running of the ORB from 1989, and the ORB's operations were incorporated into the national rail network on 1 June 1990, and from then on the New Zealand Railways Corporation operated trains on the line. In 1992 the Southland District Council sold the ORB to New Zealand Rail Limited, (the rail and ferry operations of the Railways Corporation, which was split off from the corporation in 1991) who paid $1.2 million for the line and other assets of the ORB. The proceeds of this sale were used to form the Ohai Railway Board Trust, which grants money to local projects. The line still serves coal trains between Invercargill and Nightcaps. The line is now called the Ohai Line, and it is one of the very few survivors of a formerly extensive rural branch line network.

It donated its steam locomotives X 442 and WAB 794 to the New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society in 1968 and they are leased to the Feilding and District Steam Rail Society for restoration. WAB 794 is currently in mainline operating condition and hauls heritage passenger trains in the North Island from its Feilding depot, and has been hauling Tranz Scenic's Overlander express on \\"Steam Engine Saturdays\\" and \\"Steam Engine Sundays\\". The Ohai Railway Board Heritage Trust, an organisation with no connection with the Ohai Railway Board, was set up to preserve facilities in Wairio and restore a number of steam locomotives of the P and V classes, but has been dissolved. The engines were recovered from being dumped by a river in Branxholme, formerly on the Kingston Branch town and now on the Ohai Line.

It first appeared as the B-side of the Kinks' 1968 single, \\"Days\\". The track was covered by the Romantics on their self-titled debut album. Background \\"She's Got Everything\\" was recorded in February 1966 (with possible overdubs on the song done in 1968) during the Face to Face sessions. However, the song was not used for that album (nor its follow-up, Something Else by The Kinks), and was left unreleased. However, two years later in 1968, The Kinks were forced to rush-release another single, \\"Days\\" (originally intended to be an album track on The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society), after their previous single, \\"Wonderboy\\", under-performed. \\"She's Got Everything\\" was then salvaged from their previously unreleased tracks to be used as the B-side. The track was also to be the opening track of the unreleased Four More Respected Gentlemen U.S. album. In his 33 and 1/3 book, Andy Miller states: \\"Ray Davies' [sic] decision to release it when and how he did is interesting. In the summer of 1968, despite having many more recent Kinks tracks to choose from, he selected a song that, even when it was recorded, must have sounded old-fashioned. The track listing for The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society was still in flux, and it is clear that Davies did not want to waste any potential candidates for the finished album as b-sides.\\" Lyrics and music \\"She's Got Everything\\" sees the singer saying that he's \\"got a girl who's oh so good\\", saying that \\"she's got everything\\". He says that \\"all other guys just stand and stare\\" and that he \\"ain't got a dime but she don't care\\" (however, he also mentions \\"I don't need money 'cause I got everything that I could want\\"). \\"And I can't live without her love\\", he also says. The track is sung by Ray Davies, with backing vocals from other members of the band. The song also features a guitar solo by lead guitarist Dave Davies described by Miller as \\"both timeless and utterly ridiculous.\\" \\"She's Got Everything\\" is more closely related to The Kinks' early garage rock, with its guitar driven style and simple lyrics. Miller called the track a \\"knowing pastiche of the sound formerly made by the group.\\" Other appearances \\"She's Got Everything\\" has appeared in multiple other Kinks releases aside from the \\"Days\\" single. it first appeared in album format on The Kink Kronikles, a 1972 compilation album that varied from hits to rarities. Other compilation albums the track appeared on include The Ultimate Collection and Picture Book. It also appeared as a bonus track on reissues of Face to Face. An early 1966 session version with different lyrics and a French horn appeared on the 2014 50th anniversary box set, The Anthology 1964-1971. Although never played live by the Kinks themselves, it would go on to be a regular feature of Dave Davies' live act in the 90s and 21st century, and a live version was included on his Rock Bottom Live CD from 2000. Reception \\"She's Got Everything\\" received mixed reviews. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the track a highlight from the compilation album The Kink Kronikles. Andrew Hickey said in his book, Preservation: The Kinks' Music 1964 - 1974 that the track was \\"uninspired\\".

History California Farmer was founded in 1854 by Col. James LaFayette Warren, a British-born nurseryman and merchant who had come to California from Massachusetts in 1849 at the age of 44. Before turning publisher, he tried his hand at gold mining and took note of the scurvy that afflicted miners because of their bad diet. He set up a seed business in Sacramento and began taking an interest in the broader development of agriculture in his adopted state. This in turn led to the launch of California Farmer and Journal of Useful Sciences (as it was originally titled), the first agricultural journal on the west coast.Starr, Kevin. Inventing the Dream: California Through the Progressive Era. Oxford University Press, 1986. Working with his son and business partner John Quincy Adams Warren, who was the magazine's editor, Warren aimed at a literate middle-class readership of farmers, some of whom had taken up farming after succeeding in other kinds of business elsewhere. Together the Warrens turned California Farmer into a magazine that ranked with such respected contemporary publications as American Agriculturist and Country Gentleman. California Farmer outlasted many rival agricultural journals, several of which eventually merged with it, including The Rural Californian, Golden State Farmer, Livestock and Dairy Journal, Pacific Rural Press, and California Cultivator.California Farmer, vol. 264, no. 7, April 5, 1986, p. 5 (masthead). Notable among these are the last two, both long-running publications in their own right. Pacific Rural Press and California Fruit Bulletin was founded in 1871 by a pair of transplanted Massachusetts printers, Alfred T. Dewey and Warren B. Ewer, in order to promote California farming.\\"Our First Half Century.\\" Pacific Rural Press, vol. 101, Jan. 21, 1921. Initially a weekly magazine (later a biweekly), it absorbed California Granger and several other magazines between 1875 and 1889. In 1875, the agronomist Edward J. Wickson (later dean of the University of California's College of Agriculture) became the magazine's editor, a position he held for 48 years. The magazine changed its name to Pacific Rural Press, then to Southern Pacific Rural Press (1937), and was folded into California Farmer in 1940. One of the Pacific Rural Press's editors was John Pickett, whose son Jack T. Pickett was California Farmer's publisher for 34 years.\\"Reminiscences on People and Change in California Agriculture, 1900-1975 : J. Earl Coke\\". Oral History Center, Shields Library, University of California, Davis, 1976. After he died in 1988, the Jack T. Pickett Agricultural Scholarship was established in his name to support University of California, Davis, students interested in careers in agriculture. California Cultivator, which began publication in 1889 as Poultry in California, became California Cultivator and Poultry Keeper (1892), and finally California Cultivator (1900). It subsequently merged with Rural Californian (1914), itself formerly known as Semi-Tropic California and Southern California Horticulturist (for just three issues in 1880) and before that as the Southern California Horticulturist (founded 1877).Stuntz, Stephen Conrad. List of Agricultural Periodicals of the United States and Canada Published During the Century July 1810 to July 1910. Misc. Publication 398, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, 1941. It ended publication in 1948 and merged with California Farmer. Areas of focus and controversy By the 1980s, California Farmer was both the oldest and largest of the state's agricultural magazines, with a circulation in the mid 50,000s.Taylor, Ronald B. \\"Grape Growers Still Use Illegal Chemical, Farm Magazine Says\\". Los Angeles Times, Sept. 16, 1988. It covered the entire range of subjects that affect agriculture, from plant and livestock breeding, integrated pest management and organic farming to water rights, urban expansion, and migrant workers. It reflected the interests of its readership of both large and small farmers, leading it to be perceived outside of agriculture as both traditional and conservativeHundley, Norris Jr. The Great Thirst: Californians and Water: A History. University of California Press, 2001, p. 434. and its publisher, Jack T. Pickett, as a cheerleader for the agrichemical industry.Allen, Will. The War on Bugs. Chelsea Green Publishing, 2007, p. xvii.Van den Bosch, Robert. The Pesticide Conspiracy. University of California Press, 1989, p. 124. Given the large scale of agriculture in California (a $42 billion industry as of 2012)California Department of Food and Agriculture, California Agricultural Production Statistics and the long history of tensions between small farmers, agribusiness, and urbanites, its stories occasionally stirred controversy both within and outside its own readership. In the 1960s, the magazine came out against farm workers' efforts to establish a union under the leadership of Cesar Chavez, with Pickett vilifying the union organizers as \\"cold, hard, and brutal\\" men preaching \\"hate against the farmers\\".Ferriss, Susan and Ricardo Sandoval. The Fight in the Fields: Cesar Chavez and the Farmworkers Movement. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1998. In the 1980s, under the leadership of editor Len Richardson and managing editor Richard Smoley, the magazine became more moderate. It wrote about the harm done by the financial crisis to small farmers, and it ran a cover story on marijuana, already by then the state's unofficial number one cash crop (though not officially recognized as such until some years later). In the fall of 1988, the magazine published \\"The Big Fix\\"Street, Richard Steven. \\"The Big Fix\\". California Farmer, Sept. 3, 1988. in which journalist and historian Richard Steven Street reported that some table grape growers were illegally using a growth-enhancing chemical known as 4-CPA on their vines, alongside an \\"unusually critical\\" editorial opposing the practice. The combination drew strong pushback from agribusiness, and in the wake of the uproar, managing editor Smoley resigned his post.Taylor, Ronald B. \\"Farm Journal Editor Resigns After Story Cites Use of Banned Chemical\\". Los Angeles Times, Sept. 28, 1988. In 1996, the cover story \\"An Urban Central Valley?\\" by urban planner Rudy Platzek drew wide attention to the possibility that by the end of the 21st century the Central Valley might not even be able to feed its own rapidly expanding population (due to loss of acreage to new development), let alone the rest of the country.Goldberg, Cary. \\"Central Valley Sprawl Fuels Alarm: World's Richest Farmland Producing More and More Housing Developments. Daily News, 1996. California Farmer was published twice a month except in July, August, and December, when publication was monthly. Headquartered in San Francisco for most of its existence, the magazine went through a number of owners in its final decades, including Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (which acquired it in 1988) and Penton Media, California Farmer's publisher at the time of its demise. It published its final issue in April 2013, with Penton Media stating that the magazine wasn't as profitable as its other publications.Finz, Stacy. \\"California Farmer Magazine Ends Its Run\\".

The episode aired on April 29, 2014 in the United States on FX. It was written by series creator and showrunner Noah Hawley and directed by Randall Einhorn. The title refers to the Zen Buddhist k≈çan known as The Muddy Road. In the episode, Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman) starts realizing that his involvement in the murders might soon be uncovered, as both Deputy Molly Solverson (Allison Tolman) and hitmen Mr. Wrench (Russell Harvard) and Mr. Numbers (Adam Goldberg) have set their sights on him. Meanwhile, Lorne Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton) gives his employer Stavros Milos (Oliver Platt)'s blackmailing affair an unexpected twist. The episode was acclaimed by critics, and was seen by 1.87 million viewers. Plot After being removed from the Hess case, Molly investigates the original car crash and the frozen man in the woods, and learns he was dragged from his workplace in Saint Paul by Malvo, allegedly because the man had a massive gambling debt. She obtains a still from the building's security cameras showing the abduction, but Malvo's face is partially obscured. Lester returns to work and calls on Gina Hess, Sam's widow, about his life insurance policy. She unexpectedly starts flirting with him in an attempt to get more money, unaware that Mr. Wrench and Mr. Numbers are watching from outside. Convinced he killed Hess, they later visit Lester's office and threaten him, but leave when Molly unexpectedly arrives. Molly claims that she is interested in a life insurance policy and \\"accidentally\\" shows Lester the abduction photo containing Malvo's face. Lester's reaction convinces her that he recognizes Malvo. Molly tells Bill Oswalt about her visit to Lester, but he is only more upset that Molly is still harassing Lester. Meanwhile, Malvo informs Don Chumph, the fitness instructor for Stavros's wife, that he knows he is the blackmailer. Malvo takes over the blackmail scheme and torments Stavros by exploiting his extreme religious beliefs. He kills Stavros' dog, replaces his pain medication with Adderall, and sabotages the plumbing system, causing pig blood to flow out of the shower. Gus finally tells his angry superior that he let Malvo off with a warning for speeding, and he is sent to Bemidji to inform their police department. He meets Molly for the first time and after seeing him with Greta, she invites them over to her father's restaurant where they share a friendly conversation. Reception =Ratings= The episode was first aired in the US on FX on April 29, 2014 and obtained 1.87 million viewers. The show was aired in the UK on Channel 4 on May 4, 2014 and was seen by 1.17 million viewers. =Critical reception= The third episode of Fargo was acclaimed by critics. It currently holds a perfect 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The A.V. Club writers Emily VanDerWerff and Zack Handlen gave the episode an A- rating, and said \\"The sheer amount of balance that Fargo projects makes it all the more exciting when things rush forward helter-skelter (as when Molly shows Gus the photo of Malvo) or when unpredictable elements enter to clog up the story. In the latter category, we have those two hitmen from Fargo, while in the former, we have whatever Malvo is doing to hem in Stavros (which involves switching out his medication for Adderall and putting pig‚Äôs blood in his water supply for reasons I have yet to fathom). Yet Noah Hawley is careful to always balance out advances on both sides, so the whole thing feels like a complicated chess game either side could win‚Äîeven if Molly and Malvo don‚Äôt precisely know they‚Äôre playing each other yet.\\" Another positive review came from IGN's Roth Cornet, who gave the episode an 8.8/10 \\"great\\" rating and said \\"There are some amazing sight gags throughout the episodes (...) but that light and fanciful music set against grim corpses and barbarous crime is what really sells the tone. It's that simultaneously disquieting and entirely engaging tenor that gives us enough distance to laugh even in the midst of the horror.

It was written by series creator Matthew Weiner and directed by Alan Taylor. Weiner has stated that the interval between writing the pilot and the second episode lasted seven years. The episode originally aired on the AMC channel in the United States on July 26, 2007. Plot In this episode, Don Draper's past is probed from different directions by different people and the viewer is presented with the mystery of \\"Who is Don Draper?\\" At a dinner with Don and Betty Draper and Roger and Mona Sterling, where all of the attendees talk about their affluent childhoods, Don remains silent. Roger Sterling idly probes Don about his past but Don deflects him, suggesting he will reveal the mystery in his forthcoming novel. Don says, \\"I was raised to see it as a sin of pride to go on like that about yourself\\", to explain to Betty why he deflected Roger's inquiry. Betty, meanwhile, is troubledher mother has recently died, and since that time, Betty has periodically experienced her hands going numb so that she cannot use them. She and Mona commiserate in the ladies' room at the restaurant. At home, in bed with Don, Betty also attempts to probe Don about his past, but he casts his past into the category of \\"politics, religion, and sex...why talk about it?\\" As Betty drifts off to sleep she turns to Don, fast asleep, and asks herself, \\"Who's in there?\\" The workplace is portrayed as being staffed by men who behave as boys on shore leave and who view the women as toys, an environment which the women must navigate; the title of the episode references the weeping women found in the ladies room. Sterling is portrayed as a cynical and distant alcoholic who has never grown up and misses his nanny. The members of the creative team, which Don leads, discuss a product and the question of \\"what women want\\" arises, leaving them puzzled. Paul Kinsey, attempting a Jamaican accent, tries to come across as the hip-cat man-of-the-world with the African- American man who comes to the office with a sandwich cart, but the man deflects Kinsey's comment. After Paul gives Peggy Olson the impression that he can be a good friend to her, he then comes on to her. Peggy rejects his advance, prompting him to ask \\"Do you belong to someone else?\\" Peggy expresses annoyance at being targeted by the sexually predatorial males in the office. Joan, the office manager, responds by advising Peggy to \\"enjoy it while it lasts\\". Bert Cooper, the senior partner of Sterling Cooper, is introduced as an eccentric, tolerant old man. The Draper's neighbor, Francine, gossips with Betty about their new neighbor, a divorc√©e named Helen, and Francine suggests that a divorc√©e may be bad for real estate values. Betty's physicians suggest she try psychoanalysis, an idea that upsets Don. Don asks Roger \\"what do women want?\\", but Roger has no satisfactory answer. He asks the same question of his mistress Midge, who responds \\"not being asked something like that\\". Draper then comes up with the catch-phrase: \\"Any excuse to get closer\\". Meanwhile, in Betty's first session with the psychiatrist, she talks about her relationship with her late mother and her insecurities about the new divorc√©e neighbor. After Don and Betty arrive home from dinner, he makes a phone-call to Betty's therapist, shutting himself into his study while the therapist consults his notes from Betty's session. Cultural references Don and Roger discuss Richard Nixon's campaign in the upcoming election. Paul reveals himself to be a fan of The Twilight Zone and does an impression of Rod Serling. Several characters watch the series People are Funny. Reception The episode received positive critical reviews from television journalists and critics. Alan Sepinwall, writing for New Jersey's The Star-Ledger, praised the episode for expanding the role of female characters, building on the characters established in the pilot, writing \\"the small details of how these characters are written and played gives [...] real meaning.\\" Andrew Johnston, writing for Slant Magazine was also impressed by the episode, comparing the series favorably to The Sopranos and praising Michael Gladis' acting in particular.

Its mission is to integrate and modernize the Brazilian Legislative Power, in Municipal, State and Federal levels. It started in 1997 in the Brazilian Senate Data Processing organ - Prodasen, born from the PhD project of Armando Roberto Cerchi Nascimento, an official of that body. In 1999 the Brazilian Government signed the contract, establishing a partnership between the IADB and the Brazilian Senate, initiating the Interlegis Program, which was divided into 3 phases: e-Parliament (technology within the parliament), e-Government (process automation and availability of network services for the citizen) and e-Democracy (citizen participation in the legislative process). In practice, Interlegis Program seeks to improve communication and information flow among legislators, increase the efficiency and competence of the Legislative Houses and promote citizen participation in the legislative processes, preparing the Brazilian parliaments for Participatory Democracy or e-Democracy. It operates based on four pillars: Communication, Information, Training and Technology. In the technology area, Interlegis Program develops systems for the parliaments, released them as free and open source software under the GPL license and it are developed with the participation of user communities and concerned citizens, supported by Colab environment. The main systems are: * SAPL - Legislative Process Support System - aimed at automation of electronic legislative process; * Model Portal - a CMS portal is ready to use and customized for a Legislative Houses with transparency tools, law on access to information, public participation, open data, e-democracy, among others. * SAAP - Parliamentary Activity Support System - aimed at automation of offices of parliamentarians; * SPDO - Protocol Document System - aimed at automating the electronic protocol of the Legislative Houses, reducing paper usage; * SAAL - Legislative Administration Support System - aimed at administrative automation of a parliament, as a legislative ERP. Is under development and not yet have a useful version. The Interlegis was responsible for one of the biggest digital inclusion programs at the beginning of the 21st century, distributing equipment and connecting to the Internet 3398 Brazilian municipalities through the Municipal Councils and Legislative Assemblies, thus creating Interlegis National Network - RNI. Today the technology infrastructure sector of Interlegis also active in hosting products and services developed and provided free of charge by Interlegis to the Brazilian Legislative Houses. In 2010 Interlegis created the Colab, which is a collaborative environment for the legislative communities of practice, which has Internet tools to encourage participation of concerned citizens, officials and parliamentarians of the Legislative Houses, with the goal of solving the practical parliaments problems, allowing better communication between the participating people and collaborate in various areas of knowledge such as legislative counsel, development of technologies, legislative communication and administration, among others. In 2013, after the administrative reform of the Brazilian Senate, Interlegis Program, which was previously run by a special secretariat called SINTER, became administrated by the Brazilian Legislative Institute - ILB, supervised by the Brazilian Senate body responsible for the training of legislative servants. At that time, the contract with the IADB regarding the 2nd phase (e-Government) has been extended until the end of 2014, when will occur the renegotiation and redefinition of the continuity of the program to start the 3rd phase (e-Democracy).

Life and work  Boese was originally trained as a wood carver, then attended the vocational school in Gleiwitz. In 1877, he enrolled at the Prussian Academy of Arts where he studied sculpture with Fritz Schaper. After five years, he joined the Master Class taught by Albert Wolff.Uta Lehnert: Der Kaiser und die Siegesallee. R√©clame Royale, Dietrich Reimer Verlag, Berlin 1998, . However, Boese's true wish was to become an architect and he attempted to approach that goal by providing small sculptures for building projects. He clung to that goal even when his statue \\"Narcissus\\" won a medal at the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition in 1888. It wasn't until the early 1890s that, swayed by public recognition and several more awards, Biese decided to devote himself to monumental sculptures. Siegesallee Group 4 In 1887, he had created a small figure called \\"Kaiser Wilhelm I with a Magnifying Glass\\" that attracted the attention and, eventually, the patronage of Kaiser Wilhelm II. When applications were being taken for work on the Siegesallee (Victory Avenue) project, Boese received a commission without going through the selection process. He produced Group 4, consisting of Albert II, Margrave of Brandenburg as the central figure, flanked by Eike von Repgow (compiler of the Sachsenspiegel) and Hermann von Salza (fourth Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights). The figures were severely damaged in World War II and are currently at the Spandau Citadel. In 1902, Boese's monument to Kaiser Friedrich III in Posen gained him a professorship at the Academy.

The ingots are placed in a pot of boiling water to leach elemental iron into the water and food. They were developed in 2008 by Canadian health workers in Cambodia, and in 2012 a company, The Lucky Iron Fish Project, was formed to develop the iron fish on a larger scale, promote them among rural areas, and distribute them to non-governmental organization partners. Notably, recent research found that the iron ingot had no effect on non iron-deficiency anemia. It therefore recommended against its use in Cambodia and other countries where the majority of anaemia is not due to iron deficiency. History About 60% of pregnant Cambodian women are anemic as a result of dietary iron deficiency, resulting in premature labour and childbirth hemorrhaging. Babies have an increased incidence of brain development problems. Iron deficiency is the \\"most widespread nutritional disorder\\" in Cambodia, affecting 44% of the population and resulting in a GDP loss of about $70 billion annually. Cast-iron cookware is known to transmit iron to food through cooking, but the cost to obtain it is prohibitive for individuals living in poverty in rural Cambodia. University of Guelph student Christopher Charles received a grant to conduct epidemiological health research in Cambodia from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) after completing an undergraduate degree in biomedical science. The research group distributed an iron disc to women in the village, asking them to place the disc in their pot while making soup or boiling water. The women were reluctant to use the chunk of iron while cooking, and \\"almost no one used it\\". Charles stated that it was a \\"challenge in social marketing\\". Several weeks before returning to Canada to start his Master's program, Charles called his doctoral advisor Alastair Summerlee to postpone his hormone research project. Summerlee told him to focus his research on preventing iron deficiency anemia, which eventually \\"spiralled into a PhD project\\". =Research= Charles and others distributed iron ingots in the shape of a lotus flower, but that was also rejected by the villagers. During discussions with village elders, Charles learned about a fish species deemed a symbol of good luck, health, and happiness in local folklore. The group created fish-shaped iron ingots, which were received more positively by the villagers and led to immediate increases in blood iron levels amongst the villagers, and anemia was virtually eliminated. Charles would later state that \\"You can have the best treatment in the world, but if people won‚Äôt use it, it won't matter.\\" The trial conducted from September 2008 to February 2009 increased blood iron levels in individuals for at least three months, but continued use was found to have negligible long-term effects on blood iron levels. The research spanned the late monsoon season and a dry season that began in December. The villagers relied on harvested monsoon water during the former period, and tube well water during the latter. In the study area, tube well water has high concentrations of arsenic and manganese ions, which act as complexing agents in the presence of iron. This may have resulted in the sequestration of the iron released by the ingot as well as that normally available from the food. The researchers interpreted the difference in water quality as a confounding variable, and conducted a second study to control for it. Research on iron- arsenic chemistry in the local aquifer sands shows that ferric oxides are associated with low-arsenic groundwater, whereas ferrous oxides indicate higher arsenic concentrations. For a description of arsenic distributions and processes, see: . The subsequent trial found that, compared to the base blood iron rate at the beginning of the trial, individuals using the iron fish had increased levels of blood iron after 12 months, and the rate of anemia decreased by 43%. A randomized control trial in 2017 found that the iron fish did not increase hemoglobin concentrations in a sample group of 340 Cambodian women. These women did have anemia, but it was not attributed to low levels of iron. The conclusion of the study stated \\"We do not recommend the use of the fish-shaped iron ingot in Cambodia or in countries where the prevalence of iron deficiency is low and genetic hemoglobin disorders are high\\". Production In December 2012, University of Guelph biomedical science doctoral student Gavin Armstrong established The Lucky Iron Fish Project, a company founded to commercialize the concept. The company employs \\"hard-to- employ Cambodians\\" to manufacture the fish-shaped iron ingots using recycled scrap iron from a nearby factory. The company began promoting the product in a few rural villages in October 2013, and began a full marketing campaign in Kandal Province in January 2014. In May 2014, the company announced that it had obtained in financing, including from Grand Challenges Canada, for scale production of 60,000 iron fish at a cost of about per fish. It also received $1.1 million from private investors. The company had delivered about 11,000 units to non-governmental organization partners in the first five months of 2014. It sells the units when possible, as it is more likely that individuals will use it if it is purchased, but will also distribute if for free where needed. It also planned to sell units in Canada for $25, each purchase accompanied by the donation of three units in Cambodia. As of November 2015, the company donates one unit for each unit purchased. On 28 April 2014, the company announced in a press release that it had obtained the B Corporation certification issued by the nonprofit organisation B Lab. Use The smiling iron fish is long and weighs about . It is placed in a cooking vessel with 1 or 2 drops of lemon juice for 10 minutes in 1 litre of boiling water. The lemon juice improves intestinal iron absorption. The iron fish is also used while cooking rice or stews. Approximately 92% of villagers who have the iron fish use it regularly, and many of them recommend it to friends and family as a symbol of luck. The flattened ingot was designed to maximize the exposed surface area during cooking, thus maximizing the amount of iron leached from the ingot to the food or water in the pot. Its use results in the average villager obtaining about 75% of the daily recommended dietary iron. Armstrong states that the iron does not change the taste of the water or food into which it is leached. The project targets youth in Cambodia to promote the project because of the high level of adult illiteracy in its rural areas.

Harris's top- class cricket career was largely confined to 1859, when he appeared as a batsman and bowler of unknown style in several non-first-class matches as well as in Cambridge's four first-class fixtures, which included the University match. No great indication of his merits in either batting or bowling can be gained, as his bowling figures are incomplete and he never took more than two wickets in an innings, and his position in the batting order varied between the tail-end and occasional outings as an opening batsman. Career outside cricket Educated at Sheffield Collegiate School and then privately at home in Sharnford, Harris was an undergraduate at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, graduating in 1860. From university, Harris joined the British Army as an officer in the 12th Regiment; he became a lieutenant in 1862, a captain in 1868, a major in 1881, a lieutenant-colonel in 1886 and a full colonel in 1890.

Based in Atlanta, Georgia, Lehigh Technologies operates a MRP manufacturing plant at its headquarters, with an annual production capacity of more than 100 million pounds. Lehigh also operates a MRP research and development facility, its Application & Development Center. History and growth Lehigh Technologies has been manufacturing MRP at its commercial plant since 2007. According to Lehigh, the company has demonstrated steady growth since it began manufacturing MRP at commercial scale. In 2010, Lehigh was selected as a Technology Pioneer by the World Economic Forum (WEF). The awards program recognizes companies from around the world that are involved in the design, development and deployment of new technologies that are set to have a significant impact on business and society. In June 2011, Lehigh announced that more than 100 million tires on the road had been manufactured using the company's MRP. In 2014, the company announced that more than 250 million tires produced to date had incorporated MRP. In October 2017, Lehigh Technologies was acquired by Michelin as part of Michelin's \\"4R\\" circular economy strategy.https://www.michelin.com/eng/media- room/press-and-news/michelin-news/Sustainable-development/Michelin-and-the- circular-economy-the-4R-strategy Research and development In November 2010, Lehigh expanded its in-house capabilities with the launch of the Application & Development Center (ADC), a dedicated research and development facility staffed by a team of industry professionals. The stated mission of the ADC is to develop new applications for MRP and to accelerate adoption of existing MRP applications by improving understanding of MRP chemistry, providing expert advice for new material formulations that incorporate MRP, and developing new materials based on MRP. In January 2014, Lehigh announced an expansion of its ADC that includes the hiring of new technical staff and investment in new mixing and analytical equipment. According to Lehigh, this expansion improves the ADC‚Äôs ability to develop functional materials based on MRP. Operations In addition to its production facility in Atlanta, Lehigh has developed a network of partners and distributors. =Asia= Lehigh partnered with Connell Brothers Corporation (CBC), the largest distributor of specialty chemicals and ingredients in Asia-Pacific, to market its MRP in Japan, In 2014, Lehigh announced an expanded partnership with CBC, aimed at broadening industry outreach, supply chain efficiency and technical support in Japan, as well as introducing MRP to South Korea and Southeast Asia. In September 2014, Lehigh announced the closing of an $8 million fundraise with JSR Corporation, a $4 billion specialty chemicals company based in Japan, to support the company‚Äôs geographic expansion and technology roadmap for MRP in the region. =South America= In October 2011, Lehigh expanded into Brazil with the appointment of a country manager. In December 2012, Lehigh announced a partnership with Andes Chemical Corporation to market MRP in Central America. =Europe= In September 2012, Lehigh partnered with HERA Holding, a Spanish waste-to-resource company, to market MRP to the tire, consumer, and industrial plastics and coatings industries in Europe. In 2018 Lehigh and Hera announced the completion and startup of a manufacturing facility in Spain to supply EMEA markets.https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180717005076/en/Lehigh- Technologies-Announces-Completion-Micronized-Rubber-Powder Investors Since 2008, Lehigh has raised more than $50 million from investors that include Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Index Ventures, Leaf Clean Energy and NGP Energy Technology Partners. Technology Lehigh has commercialized a proprietary cryogenic turbo mill technology that transforms end-of-life tires and post-industrial rubber materials into micronized rubber powders. Lehigh produces MRP from vulcanized elastomeric material, most often end-of-life tire material. However, it can also be produced from post-industrial nitrile rubber, ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM), butyl, and natural rubber compounds. =Products= Lehigh's MRPs are available in two product lines, PolyDyne and MicroDyne. Industries incorporating MRP into their products include tire, automotive, construction, industrial components and consumer products. It is also used as an additive in tires, plastics, asphalt, coatings, and sealants. MRP can also be incorporated into prime or recycled grade polypropylene (PP), high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and nylons. Additionally, the incorporation of MRPs in thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) and thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPV) makes it a feasible ingredient for automotive and building and construction applications. The particle size distributions of Lehigh's MRP typically range from 830 ¬µm (20 mesh) to 50 ¬µm (300 mesh), and its MRP is free of foreign particulates, such as metal and fiber. =Third- Generation Technology= Lehigh claims that its cryogenic turbo mill technology represents an evolution over previous post-manufactured rubber technologies. The most common rubber processing technology converts end-of- life tire and post-industrial rubber material into rubber chips that are typically one inch or larger in size. These chips are then used in tire- derived fuel and civil engineering projects. A second-generation processing technology converts end-of-life tire and rubber material into crumb rubber, also known as ground tire rubber (GTR). GTR typically comprises chips between one inch and 30 mesh in size, with the associated fiber and steel mostly removed. This material is used in asphalt, as garden mulch and in playgrounds. Because of the material's smaller size, Lehigh markets its micrometer-scale MRP as a third-generation rubber processing technology. MRP's size and composition enables it to be incorporated into advanced and higher-value applications. Sustainability Lehigh's MRP is used as a compound extender to replace natural rubber and synthetic polymers, as well as to act as a process aid in material production. Lehigh claims that because it replaces commodity-priced rubber- and oil-based feedstocks, MRP can reduce formulation costs. The company has asserted that MRP can offer up to 50 percent cost savings over virgin raw materials in some cases. Because it is derived from end-of-life materials, MRP can also improve the sustainability, and in some cases the performance, of the compounds in which it is used. For example, Lehigh has stated that the smaller particle sizes of MRP increase the impact strength of certain plastic compositions. However, in all applications the particle size and loading levels depend on the target application.

Education Thalib was educated as a child at PERSIS Islamic boarding school in Bangil and at the Al-Irshad Al-Islamiya school, until later in 1983 he became a student at LIPIA ( ', Islamic and Arabic College of Indonesia) in Jakarta, which is a branch of the Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Due to some dissension with one of his teachers, Muhammad Yasin al-Khattib, he left LIPIA. With the help of the LIPIA director, he continued his study at Maudoodi Institute in Lahore, Pakistan in 1986 with scholarship from Saudi government. After one year, he quarreled again with one of his lecturers and decided to leave the institution before completing his education in 1987. Thalib studied the teachings of the Salafi sect from Jamilurrahman al-Salafi al-Afghani in Kunar province, near the Pakistan border around 1990. In 1991-1993 Jafar studied under another Salafi cleric, Muqbil bin Hadi al-Wadi'i in Dammaj, Yemen. He also studied the teachings of the Salafi sect from Nasir al-Albani and ibn Baz. Activity Jafar joined the Mujahideen in Afghanistan during its war against the Soviet Union in 1987. He fought and studied for two years under the guidance of Jamilurrahman's Jamaat al Dawa al Quran in Kunar province, near Pakistan border. Jafar met Osama bin Laden in 1987 in Peshawar, at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Although Jafar follows a radical Salafi school of thought, he contradicts himself from Osama Bin Ladin and strongly renounces the violence and terrorism ideology of Osama. He furthermore said that Al- Qaeda is a terrorist organization with Khawarij ideology. Jafar returned to Indonesia around 1989 and then taught at Al-Irshad Al-Islamiya boarding school in Salatiga run by Osman Yusuf Ba'isa before left for Yemen. Upon his return from Yemen in 1993 with the help of a few Salafi followers, he then set up a boarding school called Ihya Sunnah (\\"Preserving The Prophet's Tradition\\") in Degolan village in Sleman, Yogyakarta on the Waqf land endowed by a nephew of some military official at the time. In 1999, he founded Forum Komunikasi Ahlussunnah Wal Jama‚Äôah (FKAWJ) or Communication Forum of Ahlul Sunnah Wal Jamaah, a group which was meant to push for political reform. Specifically, its purpose was to denounce the campaign of a female presidential candidate, because according to their interpretation sharia law strictly forbids women from having any authority. He declared the establishment of Laskar Jihad as a paramilitary group of FKAWJ on January 30, 2000 as an effort to defend and protect Moluccan Muslims from violence by Christians in Maluku during Maluku sectarian conflict. The group started a recruitment of members who want to wage jihad in Ambon. Although Jihad was one of the most important principles of the group, it was never meant to be an aggressor to war. It limited the jihad to defensive action to protect Muslims from Christian attacks. It was not also to mitigate a rebellion against the legitimate government. In response to the September 11 attacks, he said: In 2001 the police arrested him for allegedly presiding over a makeshift Islamic court that ordered a rapist be stoned to death, which is illegal under Indonesian law. He allegedly led the execution himself, though he was never prosecuted of his act. Later, POLRI accused Jafar of sowing hatred against Christians, particularly in Ambon, where about dozen masked men with guns, grenades and daggers attacked the village of Soya near Ambon, torching about 30 homes and a church and killing at least 12 Christians, on which Jafar denied Laskar Jihad was involved. Jafar was arrested on May 4, 2002 in Surabaya as he was en route from Ambon. On October 2002, Laskar Jihad was officially disbanded by the staff and board of supervisors of FKAWJ after a marathon meeting from October 3 to October 7, 2002. Jafar Umar Thalib disagreed with the board's decision as he was still in litigation with the East Jakarta District court where he was indicted for acts of treason, inciting, and insulting Indonesian President at that time, Megawati Sukarnoputri. Jafar obliged to announce the dissolution of Laskar Jihad when reporters asked for confirmation moments after the first Bali bombing on October 16, 2002. However, Jafar apparently still tried to gather troops to perform demonstrations so that he could press the District Court to ease his sentence. However it turned out with the dissolution of the Laskar Jihad, he was ultimately acquitted. According to the judge panel, there was no proof that Jafar had insulted or defamed Megawati Sukarnoputri, inciting the masses, and for his call for hostility in his speeches at al-Fatah Mosque in Ambon, 26 April 2002 . Later he was freed from all charges on January 30, 2003. Wahhabism and Anti Shiism At the launch of a book entitled Mereka Bukan Thagut (They're Not cause of Evil), Jafar affirmed his stance that he is a genuine Wahabist. As common among Salafi Wahhabists to strongly oppose Shia Muslims and even consider them Infidels (see Anti-Shiism), Jafar in June 2013 once said that he would declare a jihad against Indonesian Shia Muslims which allegedly tried to intimidate a Sunni congregation in Bekasi. Death After 28 days released from prison, Ja'far Umar Thalib entered the Harapan Kita National Heart Center Hospital, Jakarta due to heart disease. Ja'far died being treated for 5 days or more precisely Sunday, August 25, 2019 at 12:10 WIB. His body was held at Masjid Al-Fatah, Kampung Melayu. Then leave for Yogyakarta by plane. The body was buried the next day in Degolan, Umbulmartani Village, Ngemplak District, Sleman Regency, Yogyakarta. condolences from several figures in Indonesia, including Police General Muhammad Tito Karnavian and General of the TNI (retired) Abdullah Mahmud Hendropriyono or often called A.M.

It describes the disparity between the current rental income of a property and the potentially achievable rental income. Only from this difference arises the interest of investors, to renovate a particular object (to entire neighborhoods), resulting in an increase in rents and also the value of the property.The Guardian, https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/23/neil-smith Investment in the property market will therefore only be made if a rent gap exists. Thus, it is contrary to other explanations for gentrification related to cultural and consumption preferences and housing preferences. The rent-gap theory is a purely economic approach. While the processes described with the rent-gap theory can be observed especially in North America , the theory is being adapted for the global south, including Chile, Lebanon, and Korea.  Application  The theory has been used in agent-based modelling of the effects of gentrification on real estate markets .
