There are more than 160 described species in Pseudomallada. __TOC__  Taxonomy  This genus was originally described in 1990 by Xing-ke Yang and Chi-kun Yang under the name of Navasius. However, the name was a homonym of Navasius Esben- Petersen, 1936, a species of antlion. A replacement name of Dichochrysa was proposed by Yang in 1991. However, a ruling by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature instead maintained priority of the name Pseudomallada Tsukaguchi, 1995, thereby renaming the species previously described under the name of Dichochrysa.  Distribution  Pseudomallada is a Holarctic genus. Five species are described from North America. The majority of species are known from the Palearctic region, particularly from the continents of Asia and Africa.

Life The second son of George Danneley, a lay clerk of St. George's Chapel, Windsor, and his wife Elizabeth, he was born at Wokingham, Berkshire, into a family who had come down in the world. His first musical instruction was from his father, and at the age of 15 he studied thorough bass with Samuel Webbe and the pianoforte under Charles Knyvett, and then Charles Neate. He is also said to have had some lessons from Joseph Woelfl, presumably later, as Woelfl only settled in England in 1805. About 1803 Danneley abandoned music to live with a rich uncle, from whom he had expectations; but later resumed his musical studies. Until 1812 he lived with his mother at Odiham, where he became interested in continental music and languages from intercourse with prisoners of war quartered there. In 1812 he went to Ipswich as a teacher of music; a few years later he was appointed organist of the church of St. Mary of the Tower. In 1816 Danneley visited Paris, where he studied under Anton Reicha, Louis-Barthélémy Pradher, and Aleksander Mirecki, and encountered Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny and Luigi Cherubini. He returned to Ipswich. He was married in 1822, and around 1824 seems to have settled in London. Details of the latter years of Danneley's career in Lonron are scanty. He published music at 22 Tavistock Place, and in the post-office directories from 1832 to 1834 his name occurs as a music seller and publisher of 13 Regent Street. Works Danneley published: *Introduction to the Elementary Principles of Thorough Bass and Classical Music (Ipswich, 1820) *Palinodia a Nice, set of thirteen vocal duets *An Encyclopædia or Dictionary of Music (1825) *Musical Grammar (1825), the preface dated from 92 Norton Street, Portland Place.

Biography  Jorge Baradit spent his childhood and early adolescence in Valparaíso, where he formed a punk rock band called Trato Bestial, which performed in underground concerts in Valparaíso Region from 1986 to 1991. Coming from a lower-middle-class family, he was educated in public schools and at the Rubén Castro school in Viña del Mar. He studied one year (1987–1988) of Architecture at the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso and later Graphic Design (1988–1994) at Viña del Mar University, where he graduated. He has been dedicated to literature since 2005.  Literary career  = Fiction = He debuted in literature with ' (published in Spain in 2007), \\"a story set in a futuristic Mexico, where a Chilean mercenary named Mariana accepts the most dangerous missions that will take her through a digital form of hell. It shows a world full of organic technology taken to the limit, an imbunche, dead soldiers who reincarnate as communication systems, and a shaman who orbits the Earth.\\" A year later he wrote a short prequel of Ygdrasil, Trinidad, for which he won the award of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. GAM, April 2015 Miquel Barceló, editor of the NOVA collection of Ediciones B, in which both works appeared, described Ygdrasil as a \\"revolution in science fiction in Spanish\\", and characterized Baradit's writing as cyber-shamanism, a definition that is not to the Chilean's liking – \\"I prefer Magical Realism 2.0. Macondo already has fiber optic networks, but his shamans still take ayahuasca,\\" he said at the time. From 2006 to 2008, he maintained the Ucronía Chile blog, a project that invited writers, illustrators, photographers, and videographers to twist Chilean history at any point and under any criteria. From that experience came the book CHIL3: Relación del Reyno (Ediciones B, 2010), for which he invited Francisco Ortega, Álvaro Bisama, and Mike Wilson to act as co-editors. The volume anthologizes the best entries of the blog, added to new contributions by writers such as Carlos Labbé, Edmundo Paz Soldán, , and Rodrigo Fresán. Baradit published Synco in 2008 (in 2012 he began to work on a graphic version of the novel), an alternate history of democratic socialism that develops after 1973, with Augusto Pinochet appointed by Salvador Allende to replace General Carlos Prats. \\"It stops the military coup, the socialist government consolidates and creates the first cybernetic state, a universal example, the true third way, a miracle.\\" It is based on the unfinished Project Cybersyn. The following year Kalfukura appeared, which tells the story of a humble child who undertakes an odyssey throughout Chile to find a great ancestral treasure of metaphysical order. Unlike the typical style of Baradit, this book is closer to an adventure novel and is aimed at children and young people. About it, Baradit himself says, \\"I want to revive our myths, take them out of pedagogy and the museum and give them new life.\\" During the Santiago International Book Fair (FILSA), in November 2011, he launched his first graphic novel, Policía del karma, drawn by Martín Cáceres, where he recounts the actions carried out by a dystopian police force in an alternative Santiago that pursues people for crimes committed in their previous lives. The work won the FIC Award for best cover, best writer, best cartoonist, and best comic of the year 2011. FILSA 2015 In May 2012 he created, again with illustrations by Cáceres, Lluscuma, a fantasy graphic novel with elements of alternative worlds, time travel, hallucinations, psychological violence, alternate history, and delirium, set in 1977, during the event known as the case of Corporal Valdés (a supposed abduction by extraterrestrials), and 2013 in the context of issues related to death and torture during the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet. The work was published weekly in the print edition of the newspaper La Segunda from May to November 2012. The following year it was released in a book with the text \\"revised, corrected, expanded, and edited with the calm and care that only months of work in the laboratory can give.\\" He launched his first book of short stories, La guerra interior, in March 2017, in which he included 22 stories that span his career from 2003 to 2016 and that are a heterogeneous sample of his literary output. Baradit has been identified with the renewal movement of Chilean literature called \\"Freak Power\\", which also comprises narrators such as the aforementioned Bisama, Ortega, Wilson, and Sergio Amira. He has stood out for the use of digital tools and social networks in the development and diffusion of his works in different online, written, and audiovisual platforms, in collaboration with musicians, videographers, illustrators, and his own readers. = Nonfiction = Published in July 2015, Historia secreta de Chile (Editorial Sudamericana) was the first volume of a trilogy on hidden or unknown aspects of official Chilean history. The book became a bestseller in his country, with 8,000 copies sold a month after its launch and a total of 80,000 in just under a year. La Tercera spoke of the \\"triumph of Chilean nonfiction\\" in relation to this success, which includes contemporary authors such as , Felipe Portales, María Olivia Mönckeberg, and María José Cumplido. However, the success of Historia secreta de Chile was not free from controversy – some historians criticized the quality of its documentation, while others such as the 2016 National History Award winner and the 2006 winner Gabriel Salazar supported the publication. In the following two years Baradit released the remaining volumes of the trilogy, with covers as provocative as the first (which had portrayed Arturo Prat as a spiritualist figure, endowed with a third eye). The second showed Bernardo O'Higgins with dark glasses, emulating the famous photograph of Augusto Pinochet after the military coup, alluding to the fact that the independence leader was the country's first dictator. The third figure featured Gabriela Mistral with a tattoo reading \\"Doris\\", plus a piercing in her nose. By September 2017, the first two titles of the trilogy had together sold a record 200,000 copies.  Television  From 2015 to 2016, Baradit participated as a panelist of the nighttime series ' (broadcast by La Red), where he commented on various facts from the unofficial history of his country. In 2017, he assumed the leadership of his own program: ', a hybrid between documentary and investigative series where he toured the country, reviewing historical facts hidden in the official history. Transmitted by Chilevisión (CHV), it premiered on 21 May (Day of Naval Glories) with a chapter dedicated to the hero Arturo Prat, and was the leading broadcast in its timeslot – according to data delivered by CHV, between 7:59 and 9:00 pm it achieved an average of 9.5 ratings points, followed by Mega with 9.3 and Canal 13 with 9.  Activism  The author actively participates in citizen activism and it is common to see him supporting social causes related to civil rights movements. He does so by attending marches, presentations, spots and through social networks, supporting causes such as the gender equality movement and the pro-abortion in three grounds movements.

It is found primarily in eastern North America where it nests in sandy soils near ericaceous plants.  Description  Colletes validus face. Note the long, triangular impression. This shape give Colletes validus easy access to deep ericaceous flowers. C. validus is a medium-sized cellophane bee: females are 13-14mm long and males are 10-12mm long. As is the case with members of the genus Colletes, all individuals have an “S”-shaped 2nd recurrent vein on the forewing. Most notably, C. validus males and females have an exaggerated malar space, giving the impression of a long, triangular face. These two characteristics are diagnostic for C. validus within its range. Males are covered densely with brown-yellowish hairs, giving fresh individuals a golden tinge. Females are less hairy and have reduced, but present scopa on the hind legs. It is similar to C. inaequalis Say and C. thoracicus Smith in appearance, range and phenology, however both of these species lack the distinctive long face.  Distribution  Its range extends from the Mid-Atlantic states north through New Hampshire and west through Michigan, with sparse records west to Wisconsin and north to Ontario. C. validus is found throughout this range in sandy areas in proximity to ericaceous plants. Records from Georgia and Florida likely belong to a newly described species, C. ultravalidus.  Phenology  C. validus is a univoltine bee that flies in early spring, coinciding with the flowering of Vaccinium and other ericaceous plants. Near the southern extent of its range, adults fly in late-March, whereas further north flight occurs three to four weeks later. Males emerge precociously, i.e. a few days before females, and patrol nesting aggregations for mates. They locate females via pheromones and mate at the nest site. Females commence nest excavation upon emergence and can use their emergence burrow as the start of their nest. A high degree of natal philopatry, i.e. nesting in your birthplace, is not uncommon for aggregating bees like C. validus. If females emerge too early and their pollen hosts have not started flowering, they can wait for the flowering to begin by sitting in their nest entrance and nectaring on available flowers of other plants. Males disappear from the aggregation two to three weeks after emergence, leaving females as the only flying C. validus at the end of the season. Nesting proceeds between four and six weeks, with each nest taking between five and ten days to complete. Nests develop underground through the end of summer: eggs hatch into larvae, larvae grow on the semi-liquid provisions provided by the parent bee, and larvae pupate into adults. Anecdotal evidence from nests excavated early March suggests that some prepupae (fully developed larvae) enter diapause before pupating. Whether these prepupa ever complete development is unknown as are the factors driving diapause initiation.  Nesting Habitat  300x300px C. validus is a gregarious nester, meaning that nests often occur in aggregations (≈5 nests/m2 ). Nesting sites are located in open sandy soils with sparse vegetation, often located close to their ericaceous hosts. Nests can be found on flat ground or south-facing slopes, but rarely under a closed canopy since C. validus prefers warm soils. Dense grass deters nesting. Surprisingly, C. validus is completely absent from surveys in the lowbush blueberry fields of Maine despite the tremendous abundance of host plant and presence of its generalist congener, C. inaequalis. One explanation is that cold springtime soils discourage nesting, but this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested. Clearly, there are other factors besides open, sandy soil and host plant presence determining the nesting of C. validus within its range.  Host Plant and Foraging  The common name of C. validus—blueberry cellophane bee—suggests a tighter relationship with its host plant than may actually exist. Evidence suggests it is not limited to blueberry (Vaccinium spp.) and it will forage for pollen broadly on a diversity of ericaceous plants with urceolate flowers, e.g. bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi) and black huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata). Pollen provisions can contain up to 15% Pinus spp. pollen and males and females have been observed visiting non-ericaceous plants (e.g. Acer rubrum, Prunus spp., Amelanchier spp.) for both pollen and nectar. Part of the provisions are held within the crop during foraging and regurgitated upon return to the nest.  Nesting Biology  Blueberry cellophane bee (Colletes validus) female excavates a nest near host blueberry plants in Falmouth, MA. Nests descend from 17–60 cm and measure ≈8mm in diameter. Tunnel walls are not compacted since C. validus lacks a pygidial plate normally used for tamping down soil (a trait shared by all Colletes). Cells are constructed at the end of short lateral tunnels arranged radially around the main tunnel. Laterals are constructed from the bottom to the top. She proceeds by “painting” a Dufour's gland secretion mixed with saliva onto the walls of the cell using her short, bilobed glossa. This mixture polymerizes into a polyester- or cellophane-like substance, which is where bees in the genus Colletes get their common name. Cell construction primarily occurs at night and provisioning of the cell follows the next morning. To provision the cell, the female first forages for ericaceous pollen and packs it into the bottom third of the cell. Next, she adds nectar until a viscous soup is formed. The waterproof cellophane lining of the cell permits the usage of semi-liquid provisions. Bacteria (Lactobacillus spp.) and/or yeast likely colonize the provisions based on visible gas bubbles and sour taste (pH 3-4). Fermentation is common in other colletids that create liquid provisions, e.g. Ptiloglossa guinnae. The female hangs a single egg (≈2.65mm in length) from the top of the cell so that the egg is not submerged in the provisions. A maximum of five cells have been associated with any given nest. It is unknown whether females create more than one nest during their lifetime.  Natural Enemies  Blister beetles (Tricrania sanguinipennis) parasitize Colletes validus nests. Adult beetles lay eggs in sand that hatch into triungulin larvae. Larvae actively seek out adult bees in order to be transported down into the bee nest. A variety of arthropods prey on C. validus nests. Adults of the blister beetle Tricrania sanguinipennis (Coleoptera) have been found in completed C. validus cells. Bee flies (Bombylius mexicanus, B. pygmaeus in Beltsville, MD) have been observed ovipositing in the nest entrances of Colletes validus, but no larvae have been recovered from cells. Robber flies (Nicocles pictus) predate adult C. validus (Batra 1980). There are no known hymenopteran cleptoparasites of C. validus.  Pheromones  Entomologists have long-noted the citrus-like odor emitted by Colletes when handled. Female C. validus will swarm around netted females emitting this odor. Past research has found that C. validus will aggregate around 1-terpinen-4-ol and a 3:1:1: mixture of linalool-neral-geranial. The exact aromatic profile of the Colletes attractant pheromone is unclear but could prove valuable for attracting C. validus to nesting sites for commercial pollination efforts.  Relationship to humans  C. validus can nest on footpaths through sand plain preserves or in open backyards built on sandy oak-pine forests (e.g. Barnstable County, Massachusetts), resulting in possible conflict with humans and pets. However, concern is unwarranted as C. validus is docile and will not sting unprovoked. Like many other bees, they will forage for salts from human sweat on hot days.  Crop Pollination  The potential of C. validus as a commercial blueberry pollinator has been acknowledged, but never fully explored. C. validus has many of the characteristics of a bee that could be commercially managed for pollination including a preference for blueberry flowers, a phenology that almost exclusively overlaps with the bloom time of blueberry, and an ability to extract pollen from the deep, goblet flowers. Understanding how to attract wild C. validus to nesting aggregations and initiate nesting would be a useful first step towards securing reliable pollination on farms.

History The village of Flers, on the Somme, has been the scene of several battles during the First World War. It was originally captured by the Germans during their advance into France in 1914. It was seized by the British 41st Division and the New Zealand Division on 15 September 1916 during the Battle of Flers–Courcelette. It was lost in March 1918 during the Spring Offensive but returned to Allied hands later that year in the Hundred Days Offensive. Foundation The AIF Burial Ground was established during the First World War, towards the end of 1916, when Australian medical personnel began burying casualties from medical stations nearby. After the war, the cemetery was significantly expanded as several smaller cemeteries in the area were consolidated. These included the Factory Corner and North Road cemeteries. Cemetery The cemetery, designed by the English architect Herbert Baker and located two kilometres to the north of Flers on the D74, holds the remains of 3,475 Allied soldiers, with over half of them unknown. There are also three German graves. Within the cemetery are special memorials to several soldiers who are believed to be among the unknown remains buried at the cemetery. In addition, there are further memorials to three soldiers buried in Flers cemetery whose graves could not be identified. At the far end of the cemetery is a Cross of Sacrifice. The original interments, which took place in November 1916, are located in the southeast corner of the cemetery. Most graves are of those who died in late 1916 or early 1917, with others dating from March to April 1918 and then August to September 1918. One interment is of a casualty from 1914. Among the interments at the AIF Burial Ground is Sergeant Harold Jackson, a recipient of the Victoria Cross, who was killed in action near Thiepval on 24 August 1918. His remains were relocated here in 1927 during the consolidation of the various cemeteries in the area.

Stream crossings are the numerous instances where small perennial or intermittent streams are crossed by roads, pipelines, railways, or any other thing which might restrict the flow of the steam in ordinary or flood conditions. Crossings over any dry channel which might carry flood water is included. Any structure over or in a stream which results in limitations on the movement of fish or other ecological elements can be an issue. Types In addition to bridges and culverts streams may be crossed by fords, floodways, low-water crossings or even stepping stones. Conveyance capacity Often expressed in cubic feet per second (cfs), conveyance capacity is the amount of water a stream crossing structure will pass. The amount of water that can be predicted during flood conditions, such as a 100-year flood is one design consideration. =Failure to convey= If stream flow exceeds the capacity of the passage through the crossing or it is plugged by debris the crossing may be overtopped or the stream diverted down the road. This may result in substantial erosion as flood water cuts a gully on the side of road. Diversion occurs when a road slopes downward from a crossing and the height of the road exceeds the height of any outlet down the road. A sag (dip) in the road below the crossing may serve as a channel for over flow of excess water and prevent water from continuing down the road but is only practical on gentle slopes. Structural integrity What happens when a heavy truck passes over, or flood water plugs an opening with debris or overtops the structure. Habitat continuity Passage of wildlife, particularly fish such as salmon which spawn in streams, is a design consideration as is habitat continuity.

Written by Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz and directed by Tessa Blake, it premiered on ABC in the United States on April 27, 2018. In the episode, Gothel is ready to revive the Coven and wants Tilly to be part of the plan, and Lucy turns to another solution to save Henry, who is now dealing with the reaction from Jacinda about the tests. In the past, Gothel's origins of how she formed The Coven is revealed. Plot =Opening sequence= A carriage is featured in the forest. =In the Characters' Past= Many Years Ago, a young Gothel becomes intrigued by seeing a group of women trying out dresses that they plan to wear to an upcoming ball. After they leave, Gothel sneaks in and touches the dresses and causes a small rose to magically bloom, only to be caught by the women after they return. It appears that they're intrigued by Gothel, so they ask her to teach them magic by inviting her to the party. When Gothel arrives to a garden-like location, she unlocks a special door that enters a world in which it is revealed that Gothel is actually a wood nymph and isn't human. Unfortunately, her mother is not happy about Gothel being involved with humans and wants to groom her to become her successor. She hopes that Gothel can embrace her destiny. At the party, Gothel arrives, ready to interact with her newfound friends and show them magic. But it turns out that it was all a setup to embarrass Gothel, as they wanted to disgrace her in front of the humans by calling her an abomination. It also turns out that the humans had used this party to destroy and kill the nymphs, and when Gothel returned to the garden she finds her mother clinging to life. Her mother implores Gothel not to seek revenge on the humans and embrace her destiny by restoring their world. Gothel doesn't take her mother's words to heart and begins a mission to destroy the humans. Gothel returns to the party and begins destroying everything she touches with deadly plants and kills the person who befriended her. However, one of the friends decides she wants to join Gothel as she also kept a secret that she too has magic powers but kept it hidden in fear that she would be killed. Gothel then rids the land of humans before returning to her destroyed home with her friend. The ending of the flashback reveals a twist in the story: the flashback of Gothel took place in the Land Without Magic, thousands of years ago. Gothel confesses to her friend that despite their realm being magical, the death of the tree nymphs by the humans has turned their realm into the first ever land without magic. Using a magic bean, Gothel and her friend decide to leave for another realm to find others like them, to prepare for their return to the Land Without Magic to rid the land of humans once again after the would-be civilization begins. =In The Present Day= At the police station, Eloise/Gothel is paying a visit, but she's more interested in recruiting the desk clerk, and she uses her magic to bring him into her plan to wake up The Coven. While this occurs, Rogers interrogates Drew about Samdi about how Nick died, only to have Drew continue to warn Rogers about how powerful Samdi is. Gothel then later stalks Tilly, but Gothel assures her that she needs to be told the truth about her, and Gothel reveals to Tilly that she is her mother. Tilly doesn't buy that claim, but Gothel reminds her that it will make sense very soon. Tilly later tells Rogers about the encounter. At Jacinda's apartment, Henry is convinced the paternity test indicating that he is Lucy's father is genuine. But Jacinda isn't so sure and can't process the facts. Henry is starting to believe that Lucy is telling the truth and it might be tied to the book. Lucy pays a visit to Facilier/Samdi and tells him about the fallout that occurred between Regina and Weaver after he took the magic needed to save Henry (Regina hasn't answered Samdi's messages). Samdi believes that he can come up with a way to save Henry. Samdi suggests that Lucy find an item that can be used, and he warns her that Gothel is preparing for a war and Henry needs to be saved. When Rogers and Tilly visit Henry's apartment, Henry lets them in and he shows them a display of residents that match the description of the book. They come to the conclusion that Gothel might be planning on something bigger beyond reviving the Coven. Moments later, Rogers gets a tip about Gothel's whereabouts, and he and Tilly trace it to a theater. Unfortunately, it is a trap set by Gothel, who is ready to reveal everything about Tilly and Rogers' true relationship by telling them that they're actually daughter and father by taking a drop of blood from not only Rogers and Tilly, but from Margot. Gothel threatens all three if Tilly refuses. With Rogers held hostage, Gothel compels Tilly to join her Coven, as she has magic, and Tilly gives in, as she sees this as a way to save Rogers. The Coven begins their revival of evil. After uncovering a box of items from the apartment while attempting to convince Jacinda that she's Cinderella by rummaging through the souvenirs, Lucy finds the glass slipper and brings it to Samdi, who then uses it to create a spell that saves Henry, allowing him to live. However, when Henry returns to see Jacinda, he tells her that the stories could be real, and he and Jacinda finally kiss. But as Lucy walked inside, she is disappointed that nothing happened with the spell. Casting Notes Lana Parrilla, Robert Carlyle and Mekia Cox are credited but don't appear in the episode.

Lamb is a British American virologist. He is the Kenneth F. Burgess Professor at Northwestern University and since 1991, and an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. From 1990 to 2016, he was the John Evans Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology at Northwestern University. Lamb's research has been focused on influenza and paramyxoviruses. His work on mechanism of action of viral proteins has had a significant impact on the field of virology. His research in this area has led to the development of new vaccines and medicines. Lamb has also done considerable research on how cells work. For his contributions to the field of virology, Lamb has won several awards. In 1990, he was awarded the Wallace P. Rowe Award for Excellence in Virology Research. In 2003, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and in 2010, the University of Birmingham awarded him an Sc.D. honaris causa. He also won consecutive MERIT awards from the National Institutes of Health 1987-2006 and 2007-2016.  Early life and education  Lamb was born on September 26, 1950 in Muswell Hill, London. His uncle was a chemist, who encouraged Lamb to follow the same field. Lamb completed his B.Sc. in Biochemistry from University of Birmingham in 1971 followed by Ph.D. in Virology from University of Cambridge in 1974. His doctoral advisor was Brian Mahy and his thesis was about Sendai virus and explained how the virus replicates.  Career  Right after completing his Ph.D., Lamb moved to the United States and joined The Rockefeller University, New York for a postdoctoral program in virology. At The Rockefeller University, he worked with Purnell Choppin. Lamb was appointed assistant professor at The Rockefeller University in 1977, leaving the institute in 1982. In 1983, he joined Northwestern University as an associate professor where he established the Lamb Laboratory. The University of Cambridge awarded Lamb an Sc.D. in 1990 and Northwestern University appointed him the John Evans Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology. In 1991, he joined the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as an Investigator. He was appointed president of the American Society for Virology for a one-year term in 2001. Lamb became Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1999, elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2003 and Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2007. In 2010, the University of Birmingham awarded him an Sc.D. honoris causa. He was appointed Chair of the Department of Molecular Biosciences at Northwestern University in 2011 and served in this position until 2017. In 2016, he was appointed the Kenneth F. Burgess Professor at Northwestern University. From 1987 to 1993, Lamb was ane editor of the Journal of Virology and from 1994 to 2012, he was the Editor-in-Chief of Virology. He served on the editorial board of Cell from 2006 to 2015. Lamb has been a member and chair of the Study Group on Paramyxoviridae, International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses, since 1997. = Research = While Lamb was at The Rockefeller University, he published 22 papers with Purnell Choppin. Their work mainly focused on sequencing viral genes and characterizing viral proteins. During this time, Lamb characterized the influenza A virus M2 protein, which became the focus of much of his later work. After moving to Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois USA, Lamb set up his namesake laboratory, where he has since conducted research and collaborated with several scientists. His laboratory has studied influenza virus and paramyxoviruses, more specifically, how they replicate. They have also studied the action of the M2 and BM2 proteins and enveloped virus assembly. Lamb's research has had a significant impact on the understanding of how viruses work at the molecular level through different points in the life cycle. In 1997, Lamb and his team developed a way to stop influenza viruses from leaving their host cells, and stop the viruses at the end of their replication cycle. They found out that by disabling hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, the number of viruses exiting from the host cells decreased by 90%. Hence, they proved that hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are necessary for a complete viral replication cycle. In further research, Lamb concluded that hemagglutinin gathers at lipid rafts for an adequate concentration in the budding viruses, which results in easy entry into the next cell. In collaboration with Ted Jardetzky, Lamb determined the molecular structure of one of the pre- and post-fusion forms of the paramyxovirus fusion protein, which causes the virus membrane to fuse with the cell surface membrane. Studies on the fusion protein were applicable to the envelope proteins of SARS coronavirus, HIV and Ebola virus. All of the viral fusion proteins undergo a remarkable protein refolding event and this process brings about fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. In 1992 (for influenza A virus) and 2003 (for influenza B virus), Lamb's lab, in collaboration with Lawrence Pinto, discovered that M2 and BM2 membrane proteins of influenza A and B viruses are ion channels. Their work led to the understanding that both proteins are necessary for influenza A and B virus infection and replication.

She was a writer and radio broadcaster. Bell was born at Shag Station in eastern Otago, South Island, New Zealand, in 1891. She and her brother Francis were the children of Alfred Dillon Bell and his wife, Gertrude Eliza Robinson. Alfred was interested in the newly-developed wireless communication and established what is thought to be the first telephone connection in New Zealand, between two farmhouses, and Bell shared her father's interest. During World War I Bell served as a military hospital cook in England and acted as a hostess at the New Zealand High Commission in London. On her return to Shag Station, she took over the running of the wireless station from her brother Frank, who was running the farm. She became New Zealand's first female amateur radio operator and in 1927 she was the first New Zealander to contact South Africa by radio. In 1931 she joined the Country Women's Institute and later became a member of the Dominion executive. In 1939 she led a 70-member group of members to London to attend a world conference of country women's organisations. Bell served in the Voluntary Aid Detachment in England in World War II, as a military hospital cook and nurse. After the war Bell worked in professional radio as a writer and broadcaster for Dunedin station 4YA. During the 1950s Bell attended two further world conferences of country women's organisations, in Toronto and Edinburgh, and lectured and broadcast on New Zealand throughout Europe and Australia. In 1960 Bell stood unsuccessfully for the New Zealand National Party against sitting member Ethel McMillan in the safe Labour seat of Dunedin North. She later stood again, unsuccessfully, for the National Party nomination for Waitaki. Bell died in Dunedin on 10 August 1979, shortly after being presented with the Queen's Service Medal for community service.

Horn's murder gained national attention as an unsolved crime. According to police, Ogrod confessed to her murder four years after the crime, but in 2020, the \\"confession\\" was recognized to be false. On June 5, 2020, Ogrod's conviction was vacated by the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, and he was ordered to be freed from prison. He spent more than two decades on death row. Trials In April 1992, Walter Ogrod, a neighbor of four-year-old Barbara Jean Horn, confessed to luring Horn into his basement, attempting to sexually assault her, bludgeoning her to death with a metal object and then placing her body in a cardboard television box on nearby St. Vincent Street. In October 1993, Ogrod was prosecuted by the District Attorney of Philadelphia, Lynne Abraham, for the first time. The defense argued that Ogrod's confession had been coerced by the authorities. The jury was set to acquit Ogrod of the crime, but a juror announced that he did not agree with the verdict as it was being read, resulting in a mistrial. In October 1996, Ogrod again went on trial. He was convicted of her murder on October 8, 1996 and sentenced to the death penalty on October 9. The main evidence against Ogrod was jailhouse informant hearsay testimony that he had confessed to the crime. In December 2003, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed Ogrod's death sentence in an opinion by Justice Sandra Schultz Newman. In April 2004, that court denied Ogrod's application for reargument in an unsigned order, with Justice Thomas G. Saylor writing for the three dissenters. Further developments In April 2018, the new Philadelphia District Attorney, Larry Krasner, revealed that Ogrod's conviction would be reviewed. In addition, a district attorney spokesman revealed that prosecutors would no longer try to prevent DNA evidence in the case from being tested, including fingernail scrapings from the victim. DNA testing was concluded in January 2020, with the results definitively excluding Ogrod as the source. In light of the new DNA test results, Krasner filed a motion to have Ogrod's 1996 murder conviction overturned, which was set to go before a judge on March 27, 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was delayed until June 2020. On June 5, 2020, Ogrod's conviction was vacated by the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, and he was ordered to be freed from prison. Media coverage The case was featured on a first season episode of Unsolved Mysteries, aired on November 16, 1988. As implied, at the time the case was unsolved, and there was not yet a clear suspect. In April 2017, a book by author Thomas Lowenstein (son of Allard K. Lowenstein), The Trials of Walter Ogrod, was published. In April 2018, a segment of the documentary series Death Row Stories entitled \\"Snitch Work\\" aired, focusing on Ogrod's conviction and possible innocence.

After a hiatus, he presented himself to the Serbian audience as an actor, playing the role of Perhan in the 2010 rerelease of the Serbian film Dom za vešanje. Early life Anđelković, a Vučje native, showed interest in music at a very young age, thus in his early youth started learning to play the piano and harmonica. Gaining the ability to play it at a semi-professional level at the Belgrade music school, at 16 years of age, he participated in the first season of Zvezde Granda, where he reached second place, amassing popularity across Serbia. In 2010, he starred as Perhan in the rendition of the cult Serbian film of Serbian-Bosnian artist Emir Kusturica, Dom za vešanje, who was previously played by Davor Dujmović. He performed alongside Milica Todorović, who interpreted Azra, whose character was played in the original by Sinolička Trpkova. The musical interpretation gained massive acclaim due to the new elements it blended in to the movie classic. Anđelković resides in Belgrade, and is close friends with co-star Milica Todorović.

Ilagan (born June 19, 1954—disappeared on July 31, 1977) was an anti-martial law activist who belonged to a network of community organizations in the Southern Tagalog region in the Philippines. She was abducted by state security agents and disappeared on July 31, 1977, at the Makati Medical Center in Metro Manila, with nine other activists in what is believed to be the single biggest case of involuntary disappearance during Ferdinand Marcos’ martial law in the Philippines. The group, consisting of university students and professors working as community organizers in Southern Tagalog, later came to be known as the Southern Tagalog 10. Ilagan's name is inscribed on the Bantayog ng mga Bayani Wall of Remembrance, which honors martyrs and heroes of martial law. She is one of the heroes honored on the University of the Philippines Los Baños 'Hagdan ng Malayang Kamalayan' memorial.  Biography  As a student, Ilagan was always at the top of her class. She directed plays in high school (and won best director) and wrote for the school paper. She also attended conferences held by youth organizations, such as the Future Farmers of the Philippines. She became an activist and joined the local chapter of the militant youth group Kabataang Makabayan (KM) in her senior year in high school. She entered the University of the Philippines in Los Baños and became active in the theater group Tambuli under director Leo Rimando. She became the Southern Tagalog coordinator of KM's Panday Sining theater organization, which staged plays depicting the problems of Philippine society. She left the university when martial law was declared in 1972 and worked full-time organizing communities in the underground resistance to the dictatorship. She also worked as a staff member for an underground newsletter in Southern Tagalog. It was at this time that military intelligence personnel began pursuing her and other activists working in Southern Tagalog. On July 31, 1977, Ilagan and her two companions, Jessica Sales and Cristina Catalla, were abducted on their way to a meeting at the Makati Medical Center. They were to meet fellow community organizers Gerardo \\"Gerry\\" Faustino, Modesto Sison, Ramon Jasul, Emmanuel Salvacruz, Salvador Panganiban, Virgilio Silva, and Erwin de la Torre, all of whom were also abducted. Sison's body was later found in Lucena City, Quezon province. Silva and Panganiban's bodies were found in a ravine in Tagaytay City, Cavite. Ilagan and the rest were never found. Ilagan is recognized as a martyr and hero of martial law and her name has been inscribed on the Bantayog ng mga Bayani Wall of Remembrance. The arts festival Pista Rizalina of the Cultural Center of the Philippines was named in her honor.  In popular culture and mass media  The play Pagsambang Bayan is dedicated to Ilagan and other members of the Southern Tagalog 10. It was written by Ilagan's brother Bonifacio Ilagan and first staged in September 1977 by director Behn Cervantes and the University of the Philippines Repertory Company. The staging of the play led to the arrest of Cervantes and the play's musical director. The Cultural Center of the Philippines organized Pista Rizalina: A Festival of Arts and Ideas in honor of Ilagan. It ran from September 8 to 24, 2017, and featured nine plays on freedom and human rights. It also featured films, documentaries, a public forum, art exhibits, and musical performances. Actress Bianca Umali played Rizalina Ilagan in the GMA Network television special Alaala: A Martial Law Special, which first aired on September 17, 2017. Alaala won the Gold Camera Award in the docudrama category of the 2018 U.S. International Film and Video Festival.

It is situated near Khaosan Road in the Bang Lamphu neighbourhood in the Phra Nakhon district. The road mainly consists of two parts. The first part connects Sip Sam Hang Road with the Chakrabongse Road. The second part runs from the Chakrabongse Road, beside Wat Chana Songkhram, to the Chao Fa Road, which is at the foot of the Pra Pin- Klao Bridge opposite of the National Theater. The name, Ram Buttri, translates as 'daughter of Rama'. It refers to Mom Chao Ying Pao Suriyakul, who was the daughter of Prince Rama Isares. She donated money to build a bridge dedicated to her father, which crossed Khlong Bang Lamphu (Bang Lamphu canal), also known as Khlong Ban Khaek (Ban Khaek canal). Thus the bridge was named \\"Saphan Ram Buttri\\", and the canal was called Khlong Ram Buttri. The official opening ceremony was held on August 13, 1910, presided over by King Chulalongkorn (Rama V). Later, the canal was turned into a road, and the bridge was demolished, but its name remained. Today, Ram Buttri Road is home to hostels, guest houses, boutique hotels, bars, Thai massage services, 24 hour restaurants, and many street food stalls, which are well known among tourists. The Songkran festival usually takes place from April 13th to April 15th every year and makes the Khaosan Road one of the busiest places in Bangkok. Moreover, one lane of the road that runs out to Chao Fa Road has a name called \\"Trok Rong Mai\\" (ตรอกโรงไหม), translates as 'silk factory lane', because during the early Ratanakosin period, there were two royal silk-weaving factories: one close to Saphan Chang Rong Si (near Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense headquarters in present), and the other close to the Front Palace. The royal silk-weaving-factory located near the Saphan Chang Rong Si dissolved in the reign of King Nangklao (Rama III), remaining only another factory. It was the place to produce silk, used for the clothes of the monarch and royal family, as well as the senior civil servants. Until the reign of King Chulalongkorn, the operation was closed down due to more fabric orders from other countries. The canal that runs through this area was also called Khlong Rong Mai. Alike to Saphan Ram Buttri and Khlong Ram Buttri, although the factory and canal have disappeared, the name \\"Trok Rong Mai\\" is still used for this area. At present, it is the location of many guesthouses for tourists as well as Ram Buttri Road nearby.

The conservation park consists of land in sections 7 and 80 in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Willalooka. The Cannawigara Road which extends from Bordertown in the east to the Riddoch Highway in the west in Willalooka passes between sections 7 and 80 while Nankivell Road adjoins the eastern boundary with section 7. A fire access track is located inside the fence line on the western and northern boundaries while a disused quarry is located on the eastern boundary. It was proclaimed under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 on 28 February 1991 in respect to section 7 which was gifted to the state government by the Nankivell family. Land in section 80 which was formerly a stone reserve under the control of the District Council of Tatiara was added by proclamation to the conservation park on 16 February 2006. The name is derived from Aberdour Homestead which is located to the west of the conservation park on the east side of the Riddoch Highway in the locality of Willalooka. As of 2016, it covered an area of . In 1997, the conservation park was described as follows: > The park preserves an area of remnant vegetation typical of undulating dune > and limestone country. Due to the extensive clearance in the surrounding > area, the park provides an important habitat and stepping stone for many > fauna species, particularly birds. The conservation park supports the following three vegetation associations: #An open scrub of Eucalyptus diversifolia and Eucalyptus leptophylla located on a “rocky calcrete’’ ridge passing through the conservation park in a north- south direction and including other dominant species such as broombush (Melaleuca uncinata), slaty sheoak (Allocasuarina muelleriana), and silver broombush (Baeckea behrii). #An open scrub of Eucalyptus incrassata located on a “small strip” of sandy soil on the conservation park's northern boundary including other dominant species such as broombush, slaty sheoak and silver broombush, but distinguished from the previous association by “the presence of the canopy species E. incrassate and the scattering throughout the community of the dryland tea-tree (Melaleuca lanceolata).” #A woodland of Eucalyptus fasciculosa located along the eastern boundary. Land within the conservation park's boundaries is known to be a site for Jumping-Jack Wattle (Acacia enterocarpa), a species of plant which is listed as endangered both by the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 and the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. As of 1997, visitation consisted mainly of “local school groups” undertaking “environmental education.” The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area.
