Biography Baudracco was born on 22 October 1970 in La Carlota, Córdoba Province. She spent her adolescence with her family in Venado Tuerto, and then moved to Buenos Aires. Due to her gender identity, she suffered harassment and mistreatment and had to go into exile for several years, first in Uruguay and then in Europe. Activism On 25 June 1993, Baudracco, together with and other activists, founded the Association of Cross-dressers of Argentina (Asociación de Travestis de Argentina) and was its coordinator until 1995. Later the organization would be called the Argentine Cross-dresser Transsexual Transgender Association (Asociación Travestis Transexuales Transgéneros Argentinas; ATTTA). With the support of this organization, she would lead the movement for the repeal of the Códigos de Faltas in 15 provinces; these codes criminalized trans identities. The result was their repeal in several provinces. Baudracco actively campaigned for approval of the Gender Identity Law, which gave trans people the right to have their name of choice and access to healthcare. In September 2005, she was a founder and member of the board of directors of the (Federación Argentina de Lesbianas, Gays, Bisexuales y Trans ; FALGBT). In 2008, she conducted several prevention and research activities as a member of the Country Coordinating Mechanism of The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, work she carried out with the Ministry of Health's Directorate of AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases. Claudia Pía Baudracco died at her home in Buenos Aires on 18 March 2012. She had gone without medical checkups for much of her life, and had been unable to take advantage of the healthcare provisions of the Gender Identity Law, as it was enacted shortly after her death. Day of the Promotion of the Rights of Trans People Santa Fe's CASA LGBT for the 2018 Day of the Promotion of the Rights of Transgender People In tribute to Claudia Pía Baudracco, the Buenos Aires City Legislature passed a law on 13 June 2013, designating 18 March as \\"Day of the Promotion of the Rights of Trans People\\". This was enacted on 15 July. Documentary In 2015, the documentary film Si te viera tu madre… Huellas de una leona (in English: If your mother could see you: Footprints of a lioness), directed by Andrés Rubiño and co-produced by Patricia Rasmussen of ATTA, was presented at the Buenos Aires Legislature's Salón Raúl Alfonsín. Recognitions With the aim of establishing lines of discussion, intervention in public policies, and research on sexual diversity in Argentina and Latin America, FLACSO Argentina, the Undersecretariat of Sexual Diversity Policies of Santa Fe Province, and FALGBT created the Claudia Pía Baudracco scholarships for doctoral studies in social sciences. In 2012, development began on the . This is a project conceived by Baudracco and María Belén Correa, gathering materials such as photos, videos, and newspaper clippings to reconstruct an Argentine trans remembrance. In 2014, it organized a piece titled La construcción de una Líder at the FALGBT's headquarters, with photos, letters, and objects of Baudracco. In 2013, the Claudia Pía Baudracco textile cooperative was formed in Mar del Plata, led by 14 trans women in the area, intended as an alternative to sex work. In 2017, the Claudia Pía Baudracco Inclusive Health Center, Chubut Province's first such facility, was inaugurated in Comodoro Rivadavia.

Biography  Moshe Levy was born in Tunisia. His brothers and sisters were killed in World War II in a German bombardment, in 1948 he immigrated to Israel with his parents. At first, he grew up in a refugee absorption camp and later in Magdiel. His father died when Moshe was 8 years old. Later, he was educated at the \\"Neve Amiel\\" yeshiva high school in Sde Ya'akov and in the Youth Ailyah’s \\"HaShomer\\" farm in Ilaniya, and later moved from Yavne to Ashdod.  Military Career  When the Yom Kippur War broke out, Levy was 28 years old, married and father of a son and daughter. About two months before the war, he was injured in a car accident and broke his patella. A month before the war, his reserve unit was called into action, but he was still in cast and not enlisted; Only two weeks before the outbreak of the war, the doctors removed the bandage. Despite the improvement in his condition, Levi was not enlisted, so he decided on his own to go and join the battalion. Ze'ev Littman, a battalion commander in Brigade 11 (Yiftah Brigade) appointed him to command a half-track, and that evening he joined the journey to the front in Sinai. On October 8, the brigade deployed in the El Qantara area and Company L, to which Levy belonged, conducted pursuits after Egyptian commandos. On October 15, when his unit was in Beluzah (Pelusium), a call was received for the rescue of an IDF force caught in an Egyptian ambush on the \\"plastic road\\" on its way to “Fort Budapest”. The Egyptian commando fighters waited until the rescue force's half-tracks entered the area where they had entrenched themselves, and then attacked with the AT-3 Sagger missiles and rockets that disabled most of the vehicles. Levy's half-track was hit by a rocket in the caterpillar track. His right arm was cut off below his shoulder by the wing of a missile that passed over him. With a bleeding arm, he ordered the soldiers to jump after him out of the half-track, four soldiers who didn't jump out were killed by a missile. Levy was certain that he would not survive and therefore decided to attack the position of the Egyptian ambush. After failing to shoot from the Uzi submachine gun he had in his possession, he decided to move to the post and throw a hand grenade into it. The Egyptian soldiers, who noticed his bleeding arm, did not see his left hand with the grenade and did not shoot him. They may have thought he was going to surrender. From a distance of about ten meters, Levy threw the grenade and disabled the post, but fragments of the grenade hit his face and chest. When he got up, he was shot in the back. The bullet from this shot remained in his body even after he recovered from the injury. The description of the deed reads: For his acts in the battle, Levy was decorated with Medal of Valor by Defense Minister Shimon Peres for \\"valiant courage, bravery, fortitude and dedication to the mission.\\"  Civil Career  After completing mandatory military service, he joined the police and worked in the Special Tasks Department in the Tel Aviv District, and in the Elta Systems. After recovering from his injuries, he went to study in the United States, where he received a bachelor's and master's degree in business administration. In 1982, he returned to Israel to join the First Lebanon War. He did not participate in combat, but joined his friends at Lake Qaraoun in Lebanon, in 1983, after completing his master's degree, he returned to Israel and served as CEO of Magal Systems for five years, after which he returned to the United States and became CEO of “Safeguards Technology”, and later acquired it. Levy holds security businesses, where, among others, he is responsible for the security of nuclear reactors and military bases of the US Navy and the US Air Force. He was also responsible for the security of Camp David, nuclear reactors in Canada and the O’Hare International Airport in Chicago. in 1966, along with Zvika Greengold and entrepreneur Israel Lang, he purchased the Saslov Winery, and appointed his daughter, Sigal Levy, as CEO of the winery.  Personal Life  In 2013, a documentary film was made to mark the 40th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War, in which he is interviewed and tells about his life before the war, during the war, and today. That same year, Levy registered as a returning resident and joined his wife, son, daughter and two granddaughters who live in Israel.

Wolf (September 1948–April 25, 2018) was an American queer activist. She described herself as a dyke, and was also a motorcycle enthusiast and former U.S. Air Force Vietnam-era veteran. She co-founded the Dykes on Bikes (DOB) after their 1976 San Francisco Pride parade debut, and rode with them each year from 1978 until her death in 2018. The group is a highly visible symbol of empowerment and LGBT pride. Wolf nurtured DOB’s worldwide chapters and fought for their right to use the reclaimed term dyke, they fought and won two lawsuits against the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office so they could trademark their name and logo. DOB does “philanthropic work for LGBTQ causes and organizations around the world”. In June 2019, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, Wolf was one of fifty inaugural heroes to be named on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor placed inside the Stonewall Inn, and within the Stonewall National Monument.  Early life through 1970s  Soni S.H.S. Wolf grew up in Rhode Island. She joined the United States Air Force during the Vietnam War. During her time in service, she was a medic at a hospital in Texas treating wounded combat veterans. She never revealed what S.H.S. stood for, nor did she speak of her time treating wounded soldiers returning from the Vietnam War as she was too traumatized by the treatment of Vietnam vets to do so. The brutal war, which lasted from 1964 to 1973, was the first major time veterans returned not as a unit but individually, without parades celebrating victory as it was “the first major lost war abroad in American history”. It was also divisive with protests against it, and a growing opposition to United States involvement, with the public often projecting their hostility onto the vets. After her discharge she moved to San Francisco, she adopted her name Soni S.H.S. Wolf while in the military, it was used to identify her on her discharge papers. She moved to San Francisco, California, into the city’s gay district, The Castro, and became a manager of photocopier centers for Charles Schwab Corporation, and other brokerages and law firms.  Dykes on Bikes  In June 1976, a group of 20-25 lesbians decided to ride their motorcycles in the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade which had started in 1970. They led the parade to prevent their bikes from overheating due to idling behind the slower-moving walking contingents. Some motorcyclists has done the parade before then, but it wasn’t as organized. One of the riders noted them as being “dykes on bikes” which was overheard, and reported in the city’s main newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle. The Dykes on Bikes (DOB) formalized within a week of the parade. Although the name originator isn’t known, Wolf, who started riding with the group in 1978, is for embracing the name, and helping the new group helping leverage it to become one of the most visible, and empowering symbols of LGBTQ communities. Brook Oliver, lead attorney in DOB’s effort to trademark, said, > “Soni was the founding mother of Dykes on Bikes,” and added “She was the > inspiration and the mentor that allowed Dykes on Bikes to flourish all over > the world.” In the first decade of riding in the pride parade the participants would just gather at the event and ride. In the mid-1980s the DOB participants had to get more organized, the parade now requires preregistration and proof of insurance for all vehicles. Wolf continued working with the group to organize into a 501(c)(3) non-profit. She also served on the board of San Francisco Pride. DOB grew larger than San Francisco, with sixteen chapters and thousands of members in the U.S., Britain and Australia. Wolf was alarmed when a Wisconsin woman wanted to monetize the group’s name for a line of clothing, she noted dyke had been used to disparage lesbians for years, and vowed to take it back. = Trademark challenges = Wolf, as primary witness, led the DOB fight to register the groups’ name, and later, its logo. The first case went to the Supreme Court and took five years from 2003 to 2008. The legal battle began after DOB filed a trademark application in 2003. Wolf refused to accept dyke as an insult, and she insisted on treating all people with respect and dignity. Twenty-four expert witnesses provided evidence that DOB had reclaimed dyke for the lesbian community, and the term was used to empower. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) denied the trademark application twice under Section 2(a) of the Lanham Act, which does not allow consideration of trademark that could be considering disparaging to a group of people. The PTO said dyke is vulgar, offensive, \\"scandalous\\", and, according to Webster's dictionary, is \\"often used disparagingly\\". The attorney with the PTO decided dyke would be offensive to a significant portion of the lesbian community. In July 2007 the Supreme “declined to hear the case, rendering a decision in favor of protecting the name Dykes on Bikes in the court of appeals binding”. The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board allowed the group to register its name. In 2008, Wolf became central again in a second round of legal battles when DOB went to the same agency, the PTO to register the groups’ logo, which unsurprisingly includes the name of the group, Dykes on Bikes. The PTO, the same agency that had first denied then accepted the name application years earlier, now denied the logo application for the same reason it had previously refused the first name registration. This time “the Supreme Count heard oral arguments” for the case, ruling in favor of the DOB in January 2018. The same defense to allow historically oppressed minorities to use re-appropriated slurs was presented in an amicus brief to a 2017 Supreme Court case, Matal v. Tam, which decided 8-0 in favor of striking the law that PTO used against the DOB. Wolf served as the DOB historian and secretary for many years, and in 2016 she was made Secretary Emeritus. In July 2017 she stepped back from administrative duties. She died at age 69 from complications of pulmonary disease and pneumonia at Seton Medical Center in Daly City, California. The Soni Wolf Memorial Fund was set up through the DOB to cover the expenses of cataloging and archiving Wolf’s extensive collection covering the groups’ existence. As of June 2019, a GoFundMe page has raised over $3,000 of a $5,000 goal.  Honors  In 2016 she was sainted by the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence as someone who “dedicated their life to fundraising, activism, and human rights”. In June 2018, Wolf was to serve as grand marshal of San Francisco Prideevents, she died two months before the event. Her close friends represented her in the parade by carrying the custom-painted motorcycle tank from the bike she rode during her first ride in 1978. In June 2019, Wolf was one of the inaugural fifty American “pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes” inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City’s Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, while The Wall’s unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

It has a dense, umbrella- shaped crown. The wood is known as bomanga and has many uses in building and construction.  Description  B. laurentii is a fairly large evergreen tree, reaching a height of about and a diameter of . The trunk is cylindrical, without buttresses but sometimes with flutings near the base, and unbranched for the first . The outer bark is rough, yellowish-grey to dark grey, and peels away in large flakes. The inner bark is orange-red, thick and fibrous, darkening on exposure to the air. The crown is dense and umbrella-shaped, with ascending branches. The twigs are drooping, and they and the branches bear numerous lenticels. The leaves are pinnate with a short petiole swollen at its base and three to five pairs of oblong-elliptical leaflets, the basal ones being very small, and no terminal leaflet. The inflorescence is a terminal or axillary rounded panicle, the individual flowers being bisexual, small and fragrant; the flowers have five sepals, two to five thread-like petals, ten long stamens and a long coiled pistil. The fruits are flattened pods by containing two to three dark brown seeds about in diameter; when ripe, the two valves of the pod split violently apart and eject the seeds. Distribution and habitat B. laurentii is native to tropical western Central Africa. Its range includes western Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo. It grows in evergreen and semi-deciduous forests, often near rivers. It may be locally dominant, growing gregariously in stands of several hectares, with seedlings and saplings developing close to the parent tree. Uses The sapwood of this tree is susceptible to attack by insects but the heartwood is resistant to boring insects and moderately resistant to termite and fungal attack. The timber has many uses including joinery, flooring, cabinet making, furniture, blockboard, veneer, and the manufacture of barrels, boxes and crates. The bark can be used for making ropes, nets, sacks, baskets and clothing, and also to make a substitute for soap.

Released under the Victor Showpiece designation, the album was the first release of the suite, which has primarily been perceived in retrospect as a botched attempt by Ellington to capture his feelings on race in the United States through music. Consequently, it has been studied as an interesting work highlighting Ellington's complex relationship with race relations. Background and reception Ellington's agency, William Morris, promoted the concert heavily, and articles appeared in Time magazine, Newsweek and The New York Times preceding the event. When performed at Carnegie Hall in January 1943, the suite opened to both positive and negative reviews – Some critics, whether approaching the piece from a Jazz or Classical music background, complained of the wrong blend of the two genres. Record producer John Hammond offered some positive comments on the work, but mainly criticized Ellington for leaving the blues: > But the more complicated his music becomes the less feeling his soloists are > able to impart to their work. . . It was unfortunate that Duke saw fit to > tamper with the blues form in order to produce music of greater > \\"significance.\\" Music critic and author Paul Bowles, of the New York Herald Tribune was very critical, stating: \\"Presented as one number it was formless and meaningless. . . . The whole attempt to fuse jazz as a form with art music should be discouraged. The two exist at such different distance from the listener's faculties of comprehension that he cannot get them both clearly into focus at the same time. One might say they operate on different wavelengths; it is impossible to tune them in simultaneously.\\" When the album was packaged and released in early 1946, both Radio Mirror and Modern Screen wrote favorable reviews, with the latter praising the composition for its ambition and the former denoting the album \\"a must\\". Billboard magazine offered a lukewarm reception: \\"While it may not be a great musical composition, nor hold the popular appeal of his other pieces, it's Ellington music throughout.\\" Aside from the criticism of Ellington's technique, some have posed the piece was diminished by Ellington understating his feelings through music, perhaps for fear of damaging his image and reputation with white audiences. Despite this, Ellington was acclaimed for his booking at Carnegie Hall being the first of its kind for African-American performers, and has earned praise for his attempt to use the event to spur a conversation on race. The album made no appearances on early Billboard album charts.

In a just culture, after an incident, the question asked is, “What went wrong?” rather than “Who caused the problem?”. A just culture is the opposite of a blame culture. A just culture helps create an environment where individuals feel free to report errors and help the organization to learn from mistakes. This is in contrast to a “blame culture” where individual persons are fired, fined, or otherwise punished for making mistakes, but where the root causes leading to the error are not investigated and corrected. In a blame culture mistakes may be not reported but rather hidden, leading ultimately to diminished organizational outcomes. In a system of just culture, discipline is linked to inappropriate behavior, rather than harm. This allows for individual accountability and promotes a learning organization culture. In this system, honest human mistakes are seen as a learning opportunity for the organization and its employees. The individual who made the mistake may be offered additional training and coaching. However, willful misconduct may result in disciplinary action such as termination of employment—even if no harm was caused. Work on just culture has been applied to industrial, healthcare, aviation and other settings. According to James Reason, a just culture is one of the components of a safety culture.https://www.airsafety.aero/Safety- Information-and-Reporting/Safety-Management-Systems/Safety-Culture.aspx References Category:Systems theory ","title":"Just culture"},{"id":"61167964","text":"Sagu (or sagu de vinho — or ) is a southern Brazilian dessert, made with tapioca pearls, sugar and red wine. It is typical of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The tapioca balls were introduced to Latin America from Southeast Asia via the Spanish and Portuguese Empires. In Brazil, tapioca pearls are still known as sagu, despite being made from the native South American cassava, and not sago palms. These pearls are used in this traditional dish, known as sagu de vinho (\\"wine sago\\"), or just sagu, created in the Serra Gaúcha region, in the northeastern part of Rio Grande do Sul, but consumed in all the state. It is usually mixed with sugar and red wine and then served generally warm (but it can be eaten cold), with crème anglaise on top of it (sometimes with beaten egg whites with sugar). In some recipes, wine is mixed with grape juice, with the intent of making the dessert sweeter and less alcoholic. It is also common to infuse the wine with cinnamon and cloves in order to add flavor to the dish. Although tapioca pearls can be made at home, they are more commonly store-bought. In this kind of dessert, the tapioca pearls can be also prepared with milk or fruit juice (like orange or pineapple — generally made by people of German descent), instead of red wine, but these variations are quite rare, the wine sagu being the most popular version. History Sagu (from Malay sago or sagu) originally referred to starch extracted from Southeast Asian sago palms (saguzeiro in Portuguese), which is usually made into sago pearls in Southeast Asian cuisine. After cassava (native to South America) was introduced to Southeast Asia during the colonial era, it became an alternative starch source for making pearl sago, resulting in the name \\"sagu\\" or \\"sago\\" being used interchangeably for cassava, potato or sago starch in European cuisine. The making of tapioca balls was introduced to Brazil after the arrival of European immigrants, which became known as sagu, despite being made from native cassava starch. Location of the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil The indigenous peoples in Brazil have already chopped and cooked cassava roots for food. With the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil, in the beginning of the 19th century, the cassava flour started being prepared with Port wine, resulting in a kind of sweet porridge, such as a \\"parent\\" of sagu de vinho. In the beginning of the 20th century, some of small corporations in the southern Brazil, created by descendants of Europeans, started to produce the cassava starch as an alternative to the typical products of Europe, like the potato starch. In the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, corporations of the state of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul became producers of tapioca pearls (made of cassava), used in this dessert. Some traditional German recipes which use potato starch, like rote grütze, are very similar to sagu because they are mixture of starch and red fruits. The highland region Serra Gaúcha, where the dessert was created, is situated in the northeastern part of Rio Grande do Sul, shown in red. Although this recipe did not arrive in Brazil with the European immigrants, sagu is a symbol of the European colonization because this dessert was created by them in southern Brazil. It represents mainly the northern Italian immigration, due to the flavors and the ingredients, and German, because of the industrial technology. Cassava is a typical indigenous Brazilian ingredient that was absorbed by the traditions of the European immigrants, mixed with the traditional Italian red wine. There are lesser traditional variations of this dessert, according to the origin of the immigrants. In the families of German origin, for example, sagu can be prepared with milk, wine or also with fruits, like orange or pineapple. The Italian families make the dessert only with red wine. The Serra Gaúcha region was colonized by northern Italian and German peoples, among other European immigrants (like Poles). The rest of the state was colonized mainly by the Azorean Portuguese, Arabs (mainly from Lebanon, Syria and Palestinian territories) and Africans (mainly from Angola). This dish is popular only in Rio Grande do Sul (but it can be found in the states of Santa Catarina and Paraná), being almost totally unknown in other Brazilian states or neighbouring countries, like Argentina and Uruguay. Taste and characteristics Sagu with crème anglaise This dessert is not so sweet. For this reason, it is usually more appreciated by adults than children. In the southern Brazilian region, there is a preference for less sweet desserts, explaining its popularity in the state. It is described as a \\"sweet caviar, full of little purple balls, monochromatic and with an intense but delicate flavor\\". This recipe is relatively easy to be prepared and its smell is unmistakable. Preparation Sagu de vinho served in a ramekin The cassava root is cleaned, grated and mixed with water. After that, it is passed through a sieve with a thick fabric, producing little balls, which are heated and then cooled, getting hard and opaque. The pearls are submerged in water for generally a whole day, then drained. The time varies according to the source of the recipe. Then red wine, milk or fruit juice is boiled and water, cloves and cinnamon are added to it. When boiling the mixture again, the sago pearls are added, being stirred constantly to avoid it from sticking on the bottom of the pan. Finally, sugar is added and the mixture is stirred until it gets the wanted consistency (it can be smoother or harder, and more liquid or solid). It can be served warm, cold or at room temperature. Nutritional information The tapioca balls are quite caloric because they are pure starch, being a good source of energy. They also have dietary fiber, iron, calcium and a small amount of proteins.

The plot revolves around two men, Vic (Clemens Schick) and Tom (Max von der Groeben), who kidnap Stella (Jella Haase), and shows how she tries to escape the clutches of her two masked kidnappers. The film was released on Netflix on July 12, 2019. Plot Two former convicts named Vic (Clemens Schick) and Tom (Max von der Groeben) kidnap Stella (Jella Haase), the estranged daughter of a wealthy businessman as part of a get-rich scheme. It was then revealed that Tom is Stella's estranged boyfriend and that she is four months pregnant with their child. After kidnapping Stella, the two dress her in a red tracksuit, blindfold her, tie her to a bed, and imprison her in a soundproof room. To conceal their identities, Vic and Tom wear masks when interacting with her. Tom becomes disillusioned after Vic threatens to cut off Stella's fifth finger during a video broadcast to convince her father to pay the ransom. During her captivity, Stella discovers that Tom is one of the kidnappers. During an escape attempt, she fires a pistol and manages to obtain one of their cellphones. Stella tries to call the police but is subdued by Tom, who is increasingly guilt ridden for hurting his ex girlfriend. Tom attempts to hide the bullet but Vic learns from Stella about Tom's failure to prevent her escape attempt. Under the pretext of collecting ransom from Stella's father, Vic lures Tom into a trap in the forest. Tom is wounded during a shootout but manages to escape. Vic later collects the ransom but decides to kill Stella at their second hiding place, a boathouse. However, Tom returns to save Stella from Vic. Both men are killed during the struggle. The film ends with Stella driving off into the countryside in Vic's car with the ransom money.  Cast  * Jella Haase as Stella * Clemens Schick as Vic * Max von der Groeben as Tom Release It was released on July 12, 2019 on Netflix streaming. According to Netflix, over 18 million accounts watched Kidnapping Stella within the first week of release. Reception Nafees Ahmed of the website \\"High on Films\\" awarded the film three out of five stars. While finding the story unimaginative and predictable, Ahmed praised Kidnapping Stella for focusing on the organic character development between Tom and Stella while taking fault with the underdevelopment of Vic's character.

He was instrumental in the development of Burnside Industrial Park in the 1960s and a central thoroughfare in the Park is named Joseph Zatzman Drive in his honour. Zatzman was the only Jewish mayor in Dartmouth's history. He was invested as Member of the Order of Canada in October 1997. The Dartmourth Sportsplex, an indoor sports and community centre, opened originally 1982 was re-named the Zatzman Sportsplex in 2019 in honour of the former Mayor.  Background  Born in Saint John, New Brunswick, in 1912, he was the first-born son of Louis and Ida (Fellhandler) Zatzman. He graduated from Halifax Academy and attended Dalhousie University in the Bachelor of Commerce program. When the Great Depression began he left Dalhousie and moved to Dartmouth.  Business career  In 1934, aged 22 years old, Joseph Zatzman started his career as an entrepreneur, purchasing a small grocery store on the corner of Portland St. and Victoria Rd. in Dartmouth known as Community Groceteria. Following the sale of Community Groceteria to the Sobey Family, Zatzman entered the real estate business, under the name of Maplehurst Apartments, building a number of modern apartment buildings on the Dartmouth harbourfront. During the 1930s, Zatzman became a community leader and active member of Nova Scotia's Jewish community and was even recruited by the Jewish Immigration Aid Society to volunteer to help immigrants arriving at Pier 21. By the mid-1950s, the company had more than 200 apartments and had become one of the largest property management companies in Nova Scotia. The Royal Bank building in Dartmouth and the Dartmouth Professional Centre were both managed and built by Maplehurst. In 1956 he became the president of the Dartmouth Chamber of Commerce, and the following year was elected to the Town Council, for the first of four terms.  Politics  Zatzman was elected as mayor of Dartmouth in 1963, becoming the only Jewish mayor in the community's history. Zatzman's swearing-in took place in Dartmouth's Old City Hall in 1964. The ceremony was officiated by Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia Henry Poole MacKeen. The signature achievement of Zatzman's mayoralty was the establishment of Burnside Industrial Park. Following his mayoralty, Zatzman, served as chairman of the Nova Scotia Resources Development Board and as vice-chair of Saint Mary's University's board of governors. Zatzman had many other community involvements and chairmanships following his time in municipal politics, including the Dartmouth Chamber of Commerce, the Atlantic Provinces Chamber of Commerce, United Jewish Appeal, Atlantic Jewish Council, and the Regional Authority.  Retirement and death  Zatzman received an Honorary Degree from Saint Mary's in 1979, a Doctor of Laws. He was also a former Governor of the Saint Mary's Senate. In October, 1997, he was inducted into the Order of Canada. His citation touched upon his work as Mayor, specifically around the creation of the Burnside Industrial Park, which the citation noted now represents fifty- percent of all commercial space in Atlantic Canada. Zatzman died at the age of 95 on December 10, 2007 and was survived by sister Mrs. Liilian Aronson and children, Michael Zatzman and Karla Zatzman.

After graduating, she studied a range of graduate degrees and eventually spent ten years in industry. In 2001 she returned to the University of Oulu for her doctoral studies, studying ceramic materials for use in telecommunications. She used low temperature co-firing ceramics to create radio frequency and microwave components. She was appointed to the faculty at the University of Oulu in 2004.  Research and career  Jantunen was made Head of the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Oulu in 2008. Jantunen was supported by a European Research Council grant to investigate low temperature ceramics. She is interested in materials that can be printed on paper to use in novel electronic devices. She demonstrated that it is possible to make electroceramics that can operate at low temperatures, making it possible to use 3D printing and low cost fabrication techniques. Before the work of Jantunen, the temperature required to produce electroceramics has been too high to process with semiconductor and polymers. Jantunen has reduced the ceramic production temperature below 500 °C, making it possible to integrate with heat sensitive materials and reducing energy costs by up to 30 %. Jantunen uses sintering to create a solid without melting. She has also demonstrated it is possible to integrate low temperature ceramics with carbon nanotubes. = Awards and honours = Her awards and honours include; * 2013 Elected to the World Academy of Ceramics * 2013 Elected to the Academy of Technical Sciences * 2014 Linköping University honorary doctorate * 2018 Nokia Foundation Award * 2016 Parliamentary Innovation Award for Women * 2019 Finnish Science Prize Finnish science prize Jantunen has over 70 patents.

The gate faces east towards the Roman town of Epetia, today Stobreč.Šušnjar, Bogdan, Villa of the Diocletian in Split, p. 74th History During the late antiquity, the gate was known as the Porta Orientalis (\\"the eastern gate\\"). Probably in or around the 6th century, above the gate in the sentry corridor, a small church dedicated to St. Apolinar was built. This coincided with the complex seeing an influx of refugees from outlining communities, simmer churches were over the Golden Gate, the Iron Gate, and the Bronze Gate. The structure of this part of the wall and the door itself were later incorporated in various buildings in the following centuries, such as the Church of Dušica, which was destroyed in the Second World War. The gate was still in operation during the Middle Ages. In 1764 the Venetians, who had ruled over the city for some time, opened what became known as \\"the small gate\\", a few meters from the Silver Gate. Immediately next to the small gate, a building (later the Archaeological Museum) was built in 1820. At the end of the 19th century, the church was enlarged, and its present appearance was gained in the early 1930s. The gate was extensively renovated in 1952, after the Allied bombing of Yugoslavia in World War II during which the Baroque church Dušica (Saints-innocents) suffered extensive damage. It was during this time, controversially that attempts were made to clean up and restore the building by removing later additions of the fabric of the structure of the eastern wall of the Palace. Gates such as \\"the small gate\\" were closed off, which undermined the former aesthetic quality of the surroundings. Opposite the Silver Gate, next to the main town market is an old monastery and a church of the Dominican monastery of St. Catherine of Alexandria built in the 13th century and restored after the demolition in the 17th century. The Silver Gate was used by the Pope John Paul II in his popemobile on the way to the Cathedral of Saint Domnius, during his visit to Split in 2000. Description The Porta Orientalis was a secondary gate of Diocletian's Palace, as it was not the main gate and was located in the middle of the east wall. Made up of two parts, an outer and inner gates designed as a defensive system the architecture was less ornate and decorative that the Golden Gate located in the north wall of the palace, but still retains 2 niches, which most probably housed sculptures. Like the Golden Gate, the Silver Gate was located between two octagonal towers, and beside them, there were four more towers which oversaw the eastern gateway to the palace.

It was the primary airport of Lanzhou from the 1930s to 1970. History The airport was opened after a site was selected, about 2 km from the center of Lanzhou, by the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, in the early 1930s. The airport was built with a gravel runway of 1580 meters long and 30 meters wide. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, it was under control of the 7th Fighter Aviation Division. The airport was also an important landing site for Soviet aircraft sending aid to China during the war, and Chinese fighter ace and war hero Gao Zhihang led his pilots of the 4th Pursuit Group in November 1937 to receive new Polikarpov I-16 fighter here, and leading the group back to the eastern front to resume combat operations against the imperial Japanese approach to Nanjing .https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%85%B0%E5%B7%9E%E4%B8%9C%E5%B2%97%E6%9C%BA%E5%9C%BA On November 5, 1937, the airport was bombed by the Japanese, and on 4 December of the same year again, during which 2 died and 4 where wounded. In the following months, the airport was under attack several times more, and air battles took place over Lanzhou through 1938 and 1939 as the Japanese were persistent to capture Lanzhou. However suffering large losses of at least 15 planes in one day, they decided to give up on taking Lanzhou. In 1937, a transport plane (number 1602) carrying 38 people crash landed without casualties at Gongxingdun Airport. In 1949 the airport was fully renovated with many facilities added. However smog and tall buildings complicated landing at the airport, which required pilot aids to be added. By 1960 the runway was paved and lengthened to 1800 meters and a width of 30 meters. In 1957, the Civil Aviation Administration of China decided that the airport's location was too restrictive for the aviation needs of Lanzhou and chose a new site for Lanzhou's main airport at Zhongchuan. By 1970, Zhongchuan Airport was inaugurated and flights moved to there. In 1976, the Gansu Aviation Sports School became based at Gongxingdun Airport. Somewhere in the next decades the airport was demolished, however the PLA Air Force still owns the site in Jiaojiawan subdistrict, which is now used for staff housing and offices.

Nakamura learned German at the Goethe-Institut. Nakamura studied physics at the University of Tokyo, and earned a master's degree in 1987. During university she completed an internship with a Professor who worked on aurora. After her degree, she noticed that the male students in her class were receiving more job offers. She recognised that a bachelor's degree would not be enough for her, so applied for postgraduate diplomas. Nakamura spent two semesters in Munich before returning to the University of Tokyo for her doctoral studies, working on aurora dynamics associated with magnetospheric substorms. These included pseduobreakup and major expansion onset storms.  Research and career  After earning her PhD, Nakamura moved to the National Institute of Polar Research where she worked as a research associate. At the time she was told that it was too early for women to go to the Antarctic. She joined the Goddard Space Flight Center in 1991, and wanted to become an astronaut. Nakamura says that her \\"problem was that I did not have such good teeth\\". Nakamura was appointed an assistant professor with tenure at Nagoya University. She moved to the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics as a Senior Scientist in 1998. In 2001 Nakamura has served as the leader of the Space Research Institute at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. Here she works on plasma physics based on analysis from satellites. She was the first woman to be awarded the European Geosciences Union Julius Bartels Medal. Her research considers plasma flow and the configuration of the electromagnetic field in the magnetotail during substorms. She used data from the Geotail, Cluster II, THEMIS and Double Star missions to confirm that the earthward moving fast flows of the plasma sheet are bubbles of low density plasma that is accompanied by depolarization fronts. Nakamura investigated the shape and size of these fronts, and showed that field aligned currents flow into and out of the ionosphere at their meridional flanks. Nakamura works on the European Space Agency Cluster program, which was launched in 2000. The satellites are designed to study geomagnetic storms and how they impact the Earth's magnetic field.

The monastery was established by German-born knight Wolfer, forefather of the powerful Kőszegi family. It was subordinated to the Pannonhalma Archabbey. After a few decades of operation, Béla III of Hungary confiscated the monastery from the Benedictine friars and erected a castle in place of the abbey around 1180. Establishment Brothers Wolfer and Héder arrived to the Kingdom of Hungary during the reign of Géza II of Hungary. Wolfer was granted lands beyond the Austrian border, most of his estates laid in the valley of stream Strém (or Strem) and centered around the hill of Küszén. In 1157, Gervasius, Bishop of Győr contributed and permitted the foundation of a Benedictine abbey at the top of the mountain of Küszén, to comes Wolfer, who donated several surrounding lands and vineyards to the monastery. Gervasius subordinated the monastery to the Pannonhalma Abbey and dedicated the new monastery to Virgin Mary. Wolfer settled people to the surrounding uninhabited lands, who were allowed to pay the tithe directly to the monastery. Géza II confirmed the foundation of the abbey. The establishing charter of the Küszén Abbey was preserved through a shortened transliteration from 1230, as a result formerly some historians doubted its authenticity. Later medieval chronicles, for instance the Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum and the Illuminated Chronicle also preserved the foundation of the abbey. In an anachronistic way, the chronicles also suggest that Wolfer erected a \\"wooden fort\\" there, but decades later, the castle of Németújvár (Güssing) was built based on the abbey's stone walls. It is also possible the chronicles refer to the construction of the fort of Hédervár, and the authors merged the two locations accidentally or intentionally in their works. A few years later, Wolfer died. He was buried in the monks' cloister after his death. Dissolution According to a letter of Pope Honorius III in March 1225, the Pannonhalma Archabbey was able to appoint three abbots to the monastery of Küszén in the previous decades, before \\"King Béla took it with the promise that, in return, he would give another place suitable for building church and estates as accessories\\". Béla III (r. 1172–1196) confiscated the Abbey of Küszén from the Benedictine friars and used the abbey's stone buildings to erect a royal castle (called Németújvár, or simply Újvár, \\"New Castle\\", today Güssing in Austria) on top of the hill around 1180. By that time, the tense relationship between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire were emerged, as Béla supported the papacy against Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor during the Investiture Controversy. The Hungarian king also had conflicts over border disputes with the Duchy of Austria in the second half of the 1170s. Under such circumstances, the mountain of Küszén and its fortified abbey proved to be a strategic military site along the border with Austria. Béla compensated the abbey's parton, comes Hencse (Wolfer's son) with the patronage of the newly constructed abbey of Kapornak in Zala County. Furthermore, Wolfer's descendants remained the owners of the nearby Szentelek and Szentkút (present- day Stegersbach and Heiligenbrunn in Austria, respectively). A privilege charter by Emeric of Hungary from 1198 refers to the vineyards of Szentkút as the accessory of the newly built castle (Újvár, or Novi Castri), this is the first mention of Németújvár (or Güssing) Castle by contemporary records. The Benedictine Order was partially compensated only in 1263 by Béla IV of Hungary, despite the continued papal protests and interventions in the case. In that year, Béla IV and his wife, Queen Maria Laskarina donated the lordship of Vágújhely in Nyitra County (present-day Nové Mesto nad Váhom in Slovakia) and an island at Lake Balaton to the Pannonhalma Archabbey, in exchange for \\"the castle of Küszén, called Újvár\\". In 1271, Béla's son, Stephen V of Hungary withdrew the donation and handed over the lordship to the influential baron Lawrence, son of Kemény. In 1273, Ladislaus IV of Hungary recovered the estate to the Benedictine friars, sorting the dispute.

It was Opie's first novel published under her own name (an earlier novel, Dangers of Coquetry, was published anonymously).  Synopsis  The novel opens with Agnes Fitzhenry, a repentant 'fallen woman', returning to her father's house with her illegitimate son, Edward. It turns out that Agnes's father was driven mad from the shock of her elopement with a libertine (Clifford), and her supposed death. Agnes stays in order to nurse her father, and ultimately earns the respect of many (although not all) in the local community. However, she constantly feels a deep sense of shame and unworthiness. Eventually, Agnes's father recognises her, forgives her and acknowledges all she has done for him. Both he and Agnes die in quick succession, and are buried in the same grave. Clifford happens to come across the funeral procession. Although he does not repent his mistreatment of Agnes, he decides to take Edward away in order to make the boy his heir.  Reception  The Father and Daughter proved very popular. It ran to at least nine editions during the first three decades of the nineteenth century, and was also adapted into an opera and two plays. Several contemporary reviews praised the novel's use of pathos. Thomas Robinson suggested that Opie was seeking to develop a middle ground between the sexual politics of William Godwin (who vehemently opposed the institution of marriage) and Hannah More (who supported it).

After the Partition of India, millions of refugees flowed in Pakistan. The government responded by creating a Housing Wing in the Works, Power, and Irrigation Ministry to provide housing to the refugees and low-income families. In 1971, the Housing Wing was updated to the Housing and Settlement Directorate. In 2000, the Parliament of Bangladesh passed the National Housing Authority Act. The Housing and Settlement Directorate and Deputy Commissioner Settlement were combined to form the National Housing Authority on 15 July 2001. The agency builds housing for low income families throughout Bangladesh. The agency also carries out eviction on government land. In 2017, the NHA was constructing 34 housing projects throughout Bangladesh.

The three-and-a-half story, 108-bed building was the largest of three hotels operated on Lake Temagami by the Temagami Steamboat and Hotel Company. The company established the Lady Evelyn Hotel in 1904 under the management of Dan O'Connor and the financial backing of W. G. Gooderham and Alex and David Faskin. Supplies and passengers to the Lady Evelyn Hotel were delivered by steamboat (e.g. Belle of Temagami) from the lakeside landing at the Temagami station. In 1906, the Canadian Summer Resort Guide declared that the Lady Evelyn Hotel, Ronnoco Hotel and Temagami Inn were \\"not the result of a slow gradual growth, but prepared for the best class of guests, with every regard for their comfort and convenience\\". The three Temagami hotels could accommodate up to 500 guests at daily rates of $2.50 to $3.50 per person, among the highest in Ontario during this period. Weekly rates of $16 to $21 were available for the residential or resort-oriented vacations in which the Lady Evelyn Hotel and Temagami Inn specialized. At full occupancy in the height of the season, the three hotels brought in approximately $10,000 per week. On July 4, 1912, the Lady Evelyn Hotel was completely destroyed by a fire of unknown origin. The estimated loss was over $30,000 and was only partially covered by insurance. A number of guests were at the hotel but there was no loss of life and no details were available as to whether any personal effects of guests were destroyed. The hotel was never rebuilt and is now the site of melted and twisted remains.

Community members were to become leaders who would spearhead needed socioeconomic changes within their communities. Special Communities Cuesta Vieja in Aguadilla is on the list of \\"Special Communities\\". Special Communities are a list of 742 places in Puerto Rico which were identified as marginalized and needing attention. Established by Sila María Calderón, the eighth governor of Puerto Rico, the idea was to identify and then work to address the high levels of poverty, and lack of resources and opportunities affecting these communities in Puerto Rico. Initially there were 686 places that made the list and by 2008 there were 742 Special Communities. The OFSA agency, as it was then called, believed in solving poverty through a model that involved all community residents, the private sector and government agencies, working together to find solutions to community problems so as to improve quality of life in those communities. In 2016, with a small budget of US$3.761 million, the mission remained the same; to create sustainable development, and empower people to work together on improving infrastructure, housing and the social fabric of their communities.

Jesús Vélez Vargas, its director stated that the program was evolving with more streamlined ways to bring help to these marginalized communities. In October 2017, a month after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico's infrastructure, $41.2 million in federal funds was earmarked for The Puerto Rico Office for Socioeconomic and Community Development (ODSEC) with a mandate that the funds be distributed, for infrastructure work, to municipalities with over 50,000 inhabitants.

He got his first appearance for Lechia playing 45 minutes against Gwardia Koszalin on 26 March 1978. Salach made 7 appearances in his first season for Lechia, in what would end up being a long career for the club. In his first season Lechia finished second in the league and finished third the season after.

(born Wilhelm Feiner; December 27, 1792 – June 9, 1829) was a German Catholic priest and Jesuit who became a missionary to the United States and eventually the president of Georgetown College. Born in Münster, he taught in Jesuit schools in the Holy Roman Empire and Galicia as a young member of the Society of Jesus. He then emigrated to the United States following the restoration of the Society, and took up pastoral work and teaching of theology in Conewago, Pennsylvania before becoming a full-time professor at Georgetown College. There, he also became the second dedicated librarian of Georgetown's library, and ministered to the congregation at Holy Trinity Church. Eventually, Feiner became president of the university in 1826. Despite becoming the leader of an American university, he never mastered the English language. Long plagued by poor health due to tuberculosis, his short- lived presidency came to an end after three years, just weeks before his death.  Early life  Wilhelm Feiner was born on December 27, 1792, in the city of Münster. He entered the Society of Jesus on July 12, 1808, in White Russia (i.e. Belarus), officially becoming a member on August 7 of that year. Before emigrating to the United States, he taught in Jesuit schools in the Holy Roman Empire and Galicia. For this reason, he was sometimes erroneously identified as being Polish, rather than German. = American missionary = Conewago Chapelalt=Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Conewago, Pennsylvania He was sent to the United States in 1822, in order to assist the American Jesuits re-establish their work following the worldwide restoration of the Society of Jesus in 1814. After his move, he anglicized his name as William Feiner. From 1823 to 1826, he was assigned to the parish at Conewago in Adams County, Pennsylvania, as an assistant to Matthew Lekue. This was likely due to his fluency in the German language and the large German- speaking population in Conewago. In addition to his pastoral work, Feiner also taught theology in Conewago in 1824. Peter Kenney, the Jesuit visitor to the United States, returned to Europe, and appointed Feiner to the position in his stead; by this time, Feiner was already in very poor health. He was made the prefect of studies at Georgetown College from 1825 to 1826, as well as a professor of theology and German. James A. Neill took over as prefect of studies at the end of his term. In 1825, he became the second official librarian of the Georgetown University Library, after Thomas C. Levins, who had filled the position since 1824, was dismissed from the Society of Jesus and left for New York City. When Feiner relinquished the office the following year, James Van de Velde succeeded him.  Georgetown College  alt=Campus of Georgetown University in 1829 When the president of Georgetown College, Stephen Larigaudelle Dubuisson, was permitted to resign the office, he eagerly set sail for Europe, and Feiner was appointed president May 4, 1826, by the Jesuit provincial superior, Francis Dzierozynski. He assumed the office on July 8, 1826, despite suffering from advanced tuberculosis and being unable to speak even basic English; indeed, Feiner never mastered the English language. When Feiner learned of the provincial's order, he is said to have entered Dubuisson's room sobbing and declaring that he was neither competent to hold the office nor desired it. While president, he simultaneously ministered to the congregation at Holy Trinity Church in Georgetown. While president, Feiner was also a professor of moral theology in 1828 and of dogmatic theology as well in 1829. Given Feiner's failing health, John W. Beschter left for the college in anticipation of having to succeed Feiner as president. Overall, his administration of the college was deemed lackluster. He resigned the presidency on March 30, 1829, and on June 9 of that year, he died at Georgetown College. There, he was buried in the Jesuit Community Cemetery.

Retrieved June 29th, 2019. = Research on economies of transition= An early area of Woodruff's research has been the role of institutions such as rule of law and property rights in transition countries. For instance, together with John McMillan, Woodruff finds that Vietnamese firms in the 1990s were more likely to give a customer credit the more limited the customer's access to alternative credit suppliers, the longer the duration of their trading relationship and the more information it had gathered about the customer beforehand, and the better the customer is linked to business networks.McMillan, J., Woodruff, C. (1999). Interfirm relationships and informal credit in Vietnam. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 114(4), pp. 1285-1320. Moreover, in the absence of reliable legal enforcement, firms often agree to renegotiate contracts following a breach, implying that retaliation is not as forceful as predicted in repeated games models and not as effective as sanctions, even though community sanctions are occasionally invoked.McMillan, J., Woodruff, C. (1999). Dispute prevention without courts in Vietnam. Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization, 15(3), pp. 637-658.McMillan, J, Woodruff, C. (2000). Private order under dysfunctional public order. Michigan Law Review, pp. 2421-2458. Together with Simon Johnson and Daniel Kaufmann, Woodruff and McMillan also explore the legal system in post-communist countries. Comparing post-communist Russia and Ukraine to Poland, Slovakia and Romania, they find the size of 'unofficial' activity to be much larger in the former two than in the latter three, mostly due to higher effective tax rates, worse bureaucratic corruption, grater incidence of mafia protection, and less trust in the court system;Johnson, S. et al. (2000). Why do firms hide? Bribes and unofficial activity after communism. Journal of Public Economics, 76(3), pp. 495-520.Johnson, S., McMillan, J., Woodruff, C. (2000). Entrepreneurs and the ordering of institutional reform: Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Russia and Ukraine compared. Economics of Transition, 8(1), pp. 1-36. the central role of entrepreneurs in transition economies is further explored by Woodruff and McMillan in a JEP article.McMillan, J., Woodruff, C. (2002). The central role of entrepreneurs in transition economies. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 16(3), pp. 153-170. Overall, Woodruff, Johnson and McMillan argue that weak property rights rather than insufficient access to finance were the main binding constraint for private sector investment into post-communist countries in the 1990s, as weak property rights discourage entrepreneurs from reinvesting their profits.Johnson, S., McMillan, J., Woodruff, C. (2002). Property rights and finance. American Economic Review, 92(5), pp. 1335-1356. Similarly, they also demonstrate the importance of trust into well-functioning courts for investment: while relationships can sustain existing interactions, workable courts support the creation of new business relationships.Johnson, S., McMillan, J., Woodruff, C. (2002). Courts and relational contracts. Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization, 18(1), pp. 221-277. = Research on enterprises in developing countries= Another key area of Woodruff's research are (micro-)enterprises in developing countries and constraints to their growth. For instance, Woodruff and McKenzie find that start-up costs of Mexican microenterprises tend to be very low and returns to capital high, suggesting that entry costs are unlikely to provide an empirical basis for poverty traps.McKenzie, D.J., Woodruff, C. (2006). Do entry costs provide an empirical basis for poverty traps? Evidence from Mexican microenterprises. Economic Development and Cultural Change, 55(1), pp. 3-42. In further research, Woodruff and McKenzie randomly provided Mexican retail SMEs with cash and in-kind grants, which led to estimated returns to capital of at least 20-33% per month, with the effects being concentrated among those firms with the highest financial constraints.McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2008). Experimental evidence on returns to capital and access to finance in Mexico. World Bank Economic Review, 22(3), pp. 457-482. Together with Luc Laeven, Woodruff has also found a positive relationship between the size of firms in Mexico and the quality of the legal system, especially for proprietorships.Laeven, L., Woodruff, C. (2007). The quality of the legal system, firm ownership, and firm size. Review of Economics and Statistics, 89(4), pp. 601-614. Much of Woodruff's research on microenterprises has been conducted with Suresh de Mel and McKenzie in Sri Lanka. In one study, after randomly assigning cash grants to microentrepreneurs, they find annual real returns to capital of 55-63% per year, i.e., much higher than prevailing market interest rates, with the returns varying by entrepreneurial ability and household wealth, but not by risk aversion, suggesting that insufficient access to credit might not be a key constraint.De Mel, S., McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2008). Returns to Capital in Microenterprises: Evidence from a Field Experiment. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 123(4), pp. 1329-1372. Faced with the difficulty of measuring profits, they find that simply asking firms about their profits offers a more accurate measure than detailed questions on revenues and expenses, as firms tend to underreport a nearly a third of their revenues, and that while providing entrepreneurs with account diaries helps address that issue, it doesn't significantly change reported profits.De Mel, S., McKenzie, D.J., Woodruff, C. (2009). Measuring microenterprise profits: Must we ask how the sausage is made? Journal of Development Economics, 88(1), pp. 19-31. Moreover, the positive returns to capital are found to be completely concentrated among enterprises owned by men, a fact that cannot be explained by differences in the entrepreneurs' characteristics, but rather suggests that capital given to female entrepreneurs is more likely to be consumed or misinvested by other household members.De Mel, S., McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2009). Are women more credit constrained? Experimental evidence on gender and microenterprise returns. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 1(3), pp. 1-32. In further work on this issue, they randomly offer both existing and potential female microentrepreneurs either the ILO's Start- and-Improve Your Business (SIYB) programme or a combination of SIYB training and a cash grant, then finding that the training only has an impact on business profitability for new entrepreneurs and that the impact of the combined support dissipates in the second year.De Mel, S., McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2014). Business training and female enterprise start-up, growth, and dynamics: Experimental evidence from Sri Lanka. Journal of Development Economics, 106, pp. 199-210. In a comprehensive review of research on business trainings in developing countries, Woodruff and McKenzie conclude that business trainings generally have only modest impacts on existing firms, partly because firm owners' application of the taught practices is often limited, though trainings seem to help prospective entrepreneurs launch start- ups faster and better.McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2013). What are we learning from business training and entrepreneurship evaluations around the developing world? World Bank Research Observer, 29(1), pp. 48-82. Together with McKenzie and de Mel, Woodruff has argued most microentrepreneurs (\\"own account workers\\") are more akin to wage workers than larger firm owners, suggesting that most of them - unlike e.g. Hernando de Soto's argument - are merely waiting for wage work and unlikely to become employers.De Mel, S., McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2008). Who are the microenterprise owners? Evidence from Sri Lanka on Tokman v. de Soto. In: Lerner, J., Schoar, A. (eds.). International Differences in Entrepreneurship. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 63-87. Another key finding related to Sri Lankan firms is that providing informal enterprises with payments equivalent to two months of the profits of the median firm leads to registration of half of the firms, whereas the mere provision of information about the registration process and possibility of getting reimbursed for registration costs has no impact; land ownership issues are raised as the most common reason for not registering.De Mel, S., McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2013). The demand for, and consequences of, formalization among informal firms in Sri Lanka. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 5(2), pp. 122-150. Finally, more recently, when comparing the impact of cash and in-kind grants on the profitability of microenterprises in urban Ghana, Woodruff, Marcel Fafchamps, McKenzie and Simon Quinn found a flypaper effect whereby - unlike cash - capital coming directly into the business \\"sticks\\" there, though neither type of grants has an impact on enterprise profitability when provided to female subsistence entrepreneurs.Fafchamps, M. et al. (2014). Microenterprise growth and the flypaper effect: Evidence from a randomized experiment in Ghana. Journal of Development Economics, 106, pp. 211-226. = Further research on Latin America= Further work by Woodruff has addressed the informal sector wage gap in Mexico, El Salvador and Peru (with Douglas Marcouiller and Veronica Ruiz de Castilla),Marcouiller, D., De Castilla, V.R., Woodruff, C.

The unique, stone chapel was designed by architect Albert Munson in a Craftsman style. The church took five years to build and was completed in 1912. The chapel measures about eighty square meters and has a pitched, wooden roof. Its most striking element is that it's made of limestone stones, and built by hand.

He was a doncel in the royal court, later a knight and señor in Medina del Campo, royal chamberlain in Castile and royal scribe in Galicia. In his later years, he forged official documents with the help of a scribe, whom he killed. Despite his pleas, he was sentenced to die by Isabella I of Castile, an event which has been widely reported as idiosyncratic of the Queen's personality. In that context, Yáñez has been described as \\"a member of the petty nobility whose ancient responsibility for local justice the Monarchs sough to suppress\\". His illegitimate son was conquistador Francisco de Lugo. Biography Born and raised in Lugo, he was son of Lope Alfonso Yáñez de Lugo y Ocampo and Teresa García de Baamonde. During his youth he was doncel in the court of John II of Castile. He was granted lands in Medina del Campo and made Lord of Villalba de Adaja and Foncastín in 1450. He later became camarero real of Henry IV of Castile and royal scribe of the Kingdom of Galicia. In his later years, he was discovered to have committed forgery by asking a scribe to falsify official documents. He had then murdered the scribe and buried him in his house. For his crimes, he was sentenced to death by the Queen of Castile, Isabella I. He offered 40,000 doblas in exchange for a commutation of his sentence. Although her counsellors advised her to accept the plea, Isabella did not. De Lugo was executed and his lands, titles and possessions were inherited by his legitimate children. The event is described in Hernando del Pulgar's Crónica de los Reyes Católicos. Family He was married to Juana Gutiérrez de Montalvo y Bobadilla and had several children. His official successor was Antonio de Lugo Rivera y Guzmán. Yáñez de Lugo's illegitimate son was Francisco de Lugo, a conquistador who fought alongside Hernán Cortés and died in Veracruz in 1532. His brother, Pedro Fernández de Lugo y Monterroso, relocated to Seville, Andalusia, and had two children, both from Sanlúcar de Barrameda: Alonso and Pedro Fernández de Lugo y Escalante. The latter's second child was Alonso Fernández de Lugo y de las Casas, who conquered the last of the Canary Islands: La Palma and Tenerife. Alonso's son and successor was Pedro Fernández de Lugo, who died in Santa Marta, Colombia, in 1536. A descendant of Alonso's sister was Francisco Bahamonde de Lugo, Governor of Puerto Rico and Cartagena, who died in office in 1574.

It was bestowed upon youth from noble families, prior to knighthood. Donceles worked alongside other pajes reales (royal pages) as royal servants and received training by the Alcaide de los Donceles. One of the most famous donceles was Martín Vázquez de Arce, known as the Doncel de Sigüenza, who was page to Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, 1st Duke of the Infantado and died during the Granada War. Donceles lived in the Royal household during their adolescence. In the court of Peter IV of Aragon in 1356 there were 110 donceles of noble origin (Aragonese, Catalan and Valencian). In the Crown of Castile there were both noble donceles and other pajes and criados who were often not noble. Both pajes and donceles received military training by the Alcaide de los Donceles, a post created by Alfonso XI of Castile around 1340. In the times of the Reyes Católicos, this kind of royal servant was known as contino, hence named because of their continuous availability. Their tasks were varied, mostly administrative, and they received a fixed salary.

He was appointed the first bishop of Penafiel when the diocese was erected by Pope Clement XIV in 1770; when the diocese was suppressed 8 years later, he was promoted to Titular Archbishop of Thessalonica. Inácio de São Caetano occupied many prestigious positions in the Portuguese court: initially the protegé of Joseph of Braganza, Archbishop of Braga, in 1759 he was named confessor of the Princess of Beira (who would later accede to the throne as Maria I of Portugal); in 1787 he was made Inquisitor General of Portugal. The death of the Archbishop of Thessalonica, as the Queen's confessor, in 1788 has been cited as one of the many contributing factors (along with the death of her husband Peter III in 1786, of her son and heir Joseph, Prince of Brazil in 1788, and the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789) that led to the Queen's mental deterioration that forced her surviving heir apparent and eventual successor Prince John to take over the government in her name as regent.

Accompanied by Princess Rasendranoro and Princess Razafinandriamanitra, she joined Queen Ranavalona in Toamasina. From there they took a ship to Réunion and took up residence in the Hotel de l'Europe in Saint-Denis. After living in the hotel for a month, the royal family moved into a house near the government offices. While in Saint-Denis, she accompanied the queen during visits and public appearances, including visiting a new church under construction and meeting with the Governor of Réunion. Ramasindrazana lived there as part of the queen's household for almost two years until they were moved by the French government and brought to Marsielles. After living in France for two months, she accompanied the queen during a transfer to French Algeria. She moved into a villa in Algiers with the queen as part of the royal household.Barrier 1996, pp. 269–271. When the queen died in 1917, Ramasindrazana left Algeria and moved to Alpes-Maritimes in France, where she lived until her death.Barrier 1996, p. 358.

It was released on October 18, 2019 by Mega Collider Records. Background  Frontman Stephan Jenkins had made many different comments about the prospect of the band recording a sixth studio album prior to the release of Screamer. As far back as 2012, Jenkins stated that the band would not ever make a sixth studio album, stating that after the release of their fifth studio album, 2015's, Dopamine, they would cease recording full albums in favor of touring and recording smaller EP releases. In the coming years, the band would focus on EP releases, including We Are Drugs in 2016, a cancelled EP entitled Summer Gods that was supposed to explore trap music in 2017, and an EP of cover songs, Thanks for Everything, in 2018. Jenkins' stance on recording an album wavered at times in this era, sometimes referring to Summer Gods as an album and explaining that the recording of Thanks for Everything was to find inspiration for recording a future studio album. As late as November 2018, Jenkins was still referring to the release as an EP, though by May 2019, Jenkins announced it had grown from an EP to a full 10 song studio album. In July 2019, Jenkins announced that it had expanded into an 11-song album titled Screamer, scheduled for release on October 18, 2019. Writing and recording Jenkins notes that the album features far more outside collaborations than prior Third Eye Blind albums, with the band adopting an \\"open door policy for various artists to contribute ideas to songs. Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins was described as the album's \\"musical consigliere\\" (advisor). The album's title track features Alexis Krauss of Sleigh Bells, \\"Who Am I\\" contains a contribution from Ryan Olson of Marijuana Deathsquads, and \\"Got So High\\" features a contribution from Poliça. Jenkins stated the album's sound deviated from the sound of prior albums as well, aiming for a rougher, less polished sound and emphasizing a mantra of \\"Keep the edge, keep it weird\\". Thematically, the albums explores the idea of personal revelation and passion in the face of an oncoming dystopia, being inspired by social and political activism of recent years. Release and promotion The album was initially planned to be released prior to the band's North American tour with Jimmy Eat World in June 2019, but the album was stuck at only 90% complete at the time and was held back. While the band was unable to promote the album itself on the tour, they still teased the album's upcoming release at live shows and debuted new songs live at various shows, including \\"Screamer\\", \\"The Kids Are Coming\\", and \\"Ways\\". The studio recording of \\"Screamer\\" was released on July 25, 2019, the same day as the album's name and release date announcement. The album will be one of ten grouped together in the \\"Ten Albums, One Cause\\" breast cancer awareness campaign, which involves it receiving a special pink vinyl release. A music video for the fourth single \\"Ways\\" was released on April 22, 2020 featuring skater and transgender icon Cher Strauberry.

Career  Mercer attended the Bolton School, Bolton, Greater Manchester, United Kingdom. She obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in European Studies (French, German & Politics) at Royal Holloway, University of London. She received a Master of Arts degree in Teaching English as a second or foreign language (TEFL) at the University of Reading and a PhD degree in Applied Linguistics at Lancaster University. Between 1998-2015 Mercer was a Lecturer at the University of Graz. In 2013 she became the co-editor of the journal 'System'.

In 2012 she was awarded Habilitation at the University of Graz. The title of her submission was Emerging complexity in language learning psychology. Research In 2011 Towards an Understanding of Language Learner Self-Concept was published by Springer Publishing. In this book, Mercer investigates the nature and development of language and learner self- concept. The book provides a deep insights into how learners view themselves, and how these self-beliefs can develop and affect the progress of an individual’s language learning process. In her most-cited journal article entitled Language learner self-concept: Complexity, continuity and change, published in System in 2011, Mercer investigated the nature and dynamics of self-concept in language learning. She found that self-concept is perhaps best conceived of as a complex, multilayered, multidimensional network of interrelated self-beliefs.

Creation The hospital opened on July 3, 1891 as the Emergency Accident Hospital. It was founded by Dr. George W. Galvin, who served as the hospital's superintendent and chief surgeon. It was the first emergency hospital in the United States. Gavin opened the hospital in an annex of the United States Hotel at 144 Kingston Street. He chose this building, which was in the heart of the city's business district, because he believed quick treatment of the frequent industrial accidents that took place there would save lives. The hospital did not receive support from any existing hospital and was funded by Boston businesses and businessmen, including the Old Colony Railroad, New York and New England Railroad, West End Street Railway, Thomson-Houston Electric Company, Walter M. Lowney, the Boston Reds, William Claflin, and The Youth's Companion and its publishing company, the Perry Mason Company. Operations The hospital operated on a cooperative plan. A patient would pay $1 a year for membership in the hospital association, which would grant them access to medical and surgical services as well as filling of prescriptions at wholesale price. By 1896 the hospital association had 8,000 members. This number grew to 30,000 by 1904. The hospital had one of the city's first ambulance services. This number grew to 30,000 by 1904. Galvin discontinued it in 1903 due to alleged interference from the Boston Police Department, which had its own ambulance service. However, by 1905 the ambulance service was running again. The hospital was open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which was uncommon at that time. Physicians were also in attendance until 10 pm for those who could not make it to the hospital during the day. The hospital also had facilities for and a number of staff members who specialized in the treatment of women. In 1905 the hospital stated a system of home treatment for association members. In its first year, the hospital handled 16,000 cases. The number increased every year and 1903 the number had grown to 70,000. Closure and reopening In August 1899, the hospital was unable to pay its creditors and suspended operations. However on September 20, 1899 the hospital reopened as the Wage Earners Emergency and General Hospital. In March 1904 the hospital building was closed and underwent extensive renovation. All departments were enlarged and three new ones (optical, dental, and surgical supplies) were added. Meanwhile, hospital work was carried on outside. On November 9, 1904 the hospital reopened as Boston Emergency and General Hospital and began accepting paid patients in separate rooms. Facilities Following the 1904 renovation, the hospital building was four stories with about 3,500 for space on each floor. The basement housed four surgical rooms, an outpatient room, x-ray room, the optical department. The first floor was occupied by a reception room, pharmacy, library, eight consultation rooms, and the hospital's business office. The second floor consisted of a men's ward and a women's ward separated by a kitchen. The third floor contained 10 private rooms. The fourth was occupied by the dentistry department. The building was lit by both electricity and gas. The hospital had accommodations for 40 beds. Galvin's departure and closure On March 10, 1906, Galvin resigned as president of the emergency hospital due to his disagreement with the board of director's desire to increase space for private patients and run the institution as a more general hospital. Following Galvin's departure, the facility was renamed Grace Hospital. It fell into receivership and was acquired by Tufts College on June 30, 1911. Dr. Harry H. Germain was appointed superintendent. This arrangement lasted only one year. By 1918 the building was home to the Simon Coat Co.

Perched up, on top of Stephens Island, it guards Cook Strait and Tasman Bay, at the top of the South Island / Te Wai Pounamu.The light flashes white once every six seconds from a white cast iron tower. The light is operated remotely from Maritime New Zealand's Wellington office. It was first lit on 29 January 1894, and did not become automated until 31 March 1989, one of the last in New Zealand to be automated. Entry to the site and tower is by permit only, because it is part of the Stephens Island Nature Reserve, managed by the Department of Conservation. Today it is home to tuatara, no people and an urban myth about a cat named Tibbles.  Early history  The scar of the vertical tramway 126 years after construction The Māori name for the island, Takapourewa, originates from it once being covered in the takapou trees. Takapou – more commonly known as matipo – trees grew right down to the water’s edge, giving the effect that the island floated in the sea. The Maori word for float is rewa; hence, Takapou-rewa. In 1770, Captain James Cook sailed past, and named the island after Sir Philip Stephens, the Secretary of the British Admiralty Board. As the new colony grew in the 1850s, the island was identified as an obvious location for one of a scheme of lighthouses to be erected on significant headlands along New Zealand's long coastline. The site was first proposed in 1854, and again in 1888 after the bark Weathersfield was shipwrecked nearby. Several factors, including remoteness, turbulent Cooks Strait and steep terrain, made it a difficult and hazardous to build. In addition, it is the highest elevation above sea level of any lighthouse in New Zealand. Before the lighthouse and associated dwellings could be built, a work party arrived in 1891 to construct a boat landing ledge and vertical tramway up the precipitous cliffs. The original light components were sourced from Edinburgh and France. The eventual £9,349 cost was twice the price of many other New Zealand lighthouses. Back then, its five wick paraffin lamps made it the brightest lighthouse in New Zealand. The native māpou (red matipo) was cleared to make way for sheep and cattle, and vertical tramway. Habitat destruction and feral cats are blamed for the silencing of birdsong native tui, bellbird and saddle back. By way of contrast, when Edward Lukins, a collector of natural history specimens, visited shortly after the occupation, he recorded 31 species of birds, along with two species of land snails and four of lizards. For the keepers and their families it was a lonely and hard posting, with a perpendicular climb from boat to home. Besides keeping the light lit, they acted as wildlife rangers and coast watchers during the second World War. Isolation made illness a serious risk. For example, in May 1909, a doctor and nurse were urgently sent out from Wellington to stifle an outbreak of scarlet fever. On a brighter note, in 1947, the lighthouse featured on a four pence postage stamp. At one time, there were three keepers and small school. In the mid-1960s, Jeanette Aplin and her family lived on the island for six years. She tells her story in The lighthouse keeper's wife, a tale of self-discovery, small domestic details of a lighthouse community and her zest for isolation from everyday society.

Cases of infectious diseases often spike in the aftermath of intense storms, with flooding and damage to infrastructure leading to a wide variety of problems that increase the chance for transmission and exposure of infectious diseases, including leptospirosis. Diseases transmitted from animals to humans are collectively known as zoonotic diseases. With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of severe weather events, related public health implications are growing in scope and complexity. These implications include the need for increased surveillance of possible disease outbreaks, more robust workforce training and rapid response procedures, water, sanitation, pest control infrastructure improvements, and greater health care system resilience. Background of leptospirosis outbreak =The Disease: Leptospirosis= Leptospirosis, caused by an infection of Leptospira bacteria, is likely the most ubiquitous disease transmitted between animals and humans globally, with over 870,000 cases and 49,000 deaths reported annually. Caribbean islands like Puerto Rico have among the highest incidence rates of the disease, with climate, geographic, and socioeconomic factors interacting to increase risk to the population. Infection due to either direct or indirect exposure to host animals that shed the bacteria in the urine, most commonly the brown rat and sometimes cattle, are the main sources of infection. Haake and Levett claim that the global level of disease is expected to rise with demographic shifts that increase the number of urban poor in tropical regions that are subject to storms and flooding due to climate change. The delayed onset of symptoms of leptospirosis can make it difficult to detect and distinguish. After an incubation period of typically 5 to 10 days, but potentially as early as 2 days and up to 30 days after infection, people infected with leptospira bacteria can develop flu-like symptoms including fever, chills, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), cough, vomiting, and diarrhea. The early signs are vague and often too general to be able to make a confident presumptive diagnosis of leptospirosis. In some cases, patients may present with only febrile illness with other differentials considered including meningitis, influenza, sepsis and many others. Other patients will present with the fulminant infection exhibiting signs of end stage liver failure, acute renal failure or severe pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome (SPHS). The test considered to be the gold standard for leptospirosis diagnosis by the WHO is one that is not very sensitive in the early stages of the disease, before the body has had a chance to mount a response. This test, the microagglutination test (MAT), is a serologic test that tests the level of antibodies created by the immune system in response to the leptospira bacteria. Although this test has high specificity, it has low sensitivity, again indicating that it can miss many truly infected individuals. It is typical that doctors will submit paired serum samples form early in the course of illness and then later in order to attempt to demonstrate a 4 fold rise in titer an indication of a positive results. Additionally, individuals living in a leptospira endemic region may have relatively high initial MAT test that only indicate previous infection, but not necessarily disease. Commonly, clinicians will submit blood and urine for PCR testing, however this is often time sensitive in that samples should be collected before antibiotic treatment, and there is typically a delay of 1 to 5 days depending on the lab used., Response Standing water in Ponce, Puerto Rico, more than a week after Hurricane Maria hit the island An outbreak of leptospirosis may have affected survivors in the weeks following the hurricane. The bacterial infection is contracted through water contaminated with animal urine, with an incubation period of 2 to 30 days. Since large areas of Puerto Rico were without tap water, residents were forced to use other sources of water that may be contaminated, such as local streams. By October 23, four people were suspected of having died from the disease while 74 others were suspected of being infected. There were 18 confirmed cases, 4 confirmed deaths and 99 suspected cases by 7 November. Puerto Rico averages 5 cases of leptospirosis per month under normal conditions. Despite the possibility of an outbreak, officials did not deem the situation being as dire. In July 2018, CNN in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism (CPI), published an online article in which they had seven disease experts review an official Puerto Rico government mortality database. The seven experts all agreed that since the records listed such a large number of confirmed cases of the bacterial disease leptospirosis, Puerto Rico officials should have declared an \\"epidemic\\" or an \\"outbreak\\" after Hurricane Maria, instead of choosing to not declare that a leptospirosis outbreak had occurred. The data reviewed included 57 laboratory-confirmed cases of leptospirosis illnesses in 2017. Of those, 54 of them were reported after Hurricane Maria made landfall on 20 September 2017. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases amounted to at least a three- fold increase in cases compared to 2016 and 2015. =Government Response and Public Reaction= Many of Puerto Rico's essential public health, health care, and other government services were rendered inoperative in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Two weeks after the storm, only 5% of electrical power had been restored to the island, 11% of cell phone towers had been fixed, approximately 50% of the supermarkets were open, 9 of 69 hospitals had been connected back to the electric grid, and less than 50% of water services had been re-established. The slow pace of recovery from the storm itself fueled public anger toward the Puerto Rican and U.S. government for failing to prioritize the island's urgent needs. As reports of a spike in leptospirosis illnesses and deaths in Puerto Rico spread, the government came under heavy criticism for its response, or lack thereof, to news of a potential outbreak. Territorial officials were blamed for the perceived failure to properly equip disaster response workers who had to operate in flood waters, delays in laboratory testing to confirm leptospirosis cases (both among patients undergoing treatment and deceased individuals), and an unwillingness to report morbidity and mortality data related to leptospirosis once there was increased public scrutiny in response to the rise in deaths. Despite the criticism that existed by the public, The Puerto Rico Department of Public (PRDOH) health denies a poor response. PRDOH, with the main lab in San Juan, typically provides lab testing and surveillance of disease in the areas affected by Hurricane Maria. There are ancillary facilities located in Arecibo, Ponce, and Mayaguez. According to Concepcion-Acevedo, et al. PRDOH requested assistance from CDC, CDC Foundation, and The Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) during the aftermath. It is reported that there was severe damage of the laboratory facilities, specifically three essential lab sectors including the electrical power supply for the facility, physical structure of the laboratory, and damage of the equipment and chemical reagents from power loss and water leaks. The lab was able to create a temporary solution to transport samples from Puerto Rico in the direct aftermath of Hurricane Maria to the U.S. for surveillance and diagnostic/ confirmatory testing, thereby allowing the continual surveillance and diagnosis of high priority diseases while the rebuilding of the PRDOH facility and restoration of essential laboratory services could occur. The CDC reported several challenges associated with this temporary system including the inconsistent shipping availability to U.S. , reliance on a single generator to power the remaining PRDOH laboratory and communications (fax), and availability of appropriate specimen containers. Despite the challenges, CDC reports successful transport and shipping of over 1700 samples in 4 months and the identification of close to 350 cases of what is referred to as 'high-priority infectious disease,' including leptospirosis. Public health implications =Outbreak monitoring and Surveillance= Like most densely inhabited tropical islands, Puerto Rico has high concentrations of risk factors for zoonotic diseases like leptospirosis. Throughout the Caribbean, widespread poverty, a hot and steadily warming climate, invasive species, tourism, and lack of adequate infrastructure contribute to the persistence of endemic tropical diseases. Leptospirosis outbreaks have occurred on Puerto Rico in previous years. In 1996, Hurricane Hortense caused serious damage and flooding on the island that led to a fourfold increase in leptospirosis cases and many deaths. During the lead-up to Hurricane Maria, however, many health care providers later reported that they were not notified about the need to monitor and test for the illness. This failure to detect an increase in cases early on in the wake of Maria likely contributed to the illnesses and deaths that sparked public outcry. Given these gaps in detection, it is likely that improved disease monitoring and testing could have helped prevent the storm-associated rise in leptospirosis deaths. Choosing the best methods for surveillance in this case can be vexing. Leptospirosis, in addition to being highly variable in disease expression, can pose the added challenge of showing few clinical signs in infected individuals for weeks at a time. Because initial symptoms are indistinguishable from many other common illnesses and often do not progress beyond fever and gastrointestinal signs in terms of severity, most infections go unrecognized. Experiences of medical and public health responders to Hurricane Maria point the way toward potential improvements to leptospirosis monitoring and surveillance strategies. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which operate in multiple health campuses throughout Puerto Rico, established enhanced laboratory-based surveillance after the hurricane hit in order to monitor various infections at VA facilities for the possibility of an outbreak. Enhanced surveillance by the VA detected two DNA-confirmed cases of leptospirosis following the storm. In addition to laboratory testing of disease cases, the VA tracked groupings of infectious disease syndromes such as pneumonia and gastrointestinal illness as share of total visits to emergency departments on the island to try to identify trends for improved planning and resource allocation. A study of disease surveillance in Puerto Rico after a period of floods caused by Hurricane Hortense in 1996 found an increase in leptospirosis infections that were caught by laboratory tests for dengue fever. The dengue tests found leptospirosis that otherwise would most likely have gone undetected and possibly proven fatal in some cases. This finding supports the need for readily available field laboratory testing for leptospirosis during flooding and other disruptive hydrologic events. Bandara, et al. discuss the contribution of travel to the increasing caseload of leptospirosis, specifically in some countries. They describe an increase in reporting of leptospirosis suspected to be due to what is termed 'recreational exposure'. They claim that international travel constitutes a major independent risk factor for contracting leptospirosis and that leptospirosis is rarely included in the general differential diagnosis outside of endemic regions. Depending on the test used, there may also be difficulty in currently identifying the infecting server due to geographic variability and there may be a distribution bias as the countries with the highest number of cases with positive leptospirosis assays are those in travelers whose origin is an endemic region such as US, Netherlands, Japan, France, Germany, Australia with appropriate testing facilities. Monitoring invasive species can also provide insight into how Leptospira is being maintained in the environment. Benavidez et al. demonstrate that rats, mice, and mongooses all contribute to spreading the bacteria in rural areas. Managing these invasive species and reducing their populations could help control the spread of leptospirosis by reducing chances of exposure. Public health authorities in endemic areas should have a responsibility to coordinate with regional authorities to monitor epidemiological trends with the goal of identifying geographical areas what would benefit from increased service provision and education, likewise correspondence with tourist activities or events expected to bring masses of people should involve measures to address primary and secondary prevention. Bandara et al. suggests prophylactic antibiotic use when individuals are involved with high-risk activities. =Climate= Warm temperatures, storms, adverse living conditions, poverty, and harmful land use policies all contribute to increased risk for leptospirosis. As global climate change continues to drive convergence of these factors, especially in tropical islands like Puerto Rico, local public health officials and their governments face a multitude of challenges. Leptospira bacteria can survive longer at higher temperatures, with more human cases observed during summer months. Increased rainfall and flooding associated with climate change opens up transmission pathways for leptospirosis and other zoonotic diseases, such as damaged sanitation and water treatment systems, flooded farms, and rodents or other animals seeking shelter and dry land. Puerto Rico is at a particularly elevated risk of infectious disease outbreaks related to climate change. The U.S. island's small size, remoteness from the mainland, low socioeconomic status, and high population density all magnify the population's exposure and susceptibility to illnesses like leptospirosis. As warmer air and water lead to increased precipitation and more energetic hurricanes, the island will need to adapt and build systems that mitigate climate-linked infectious disease transmission. Public health officials will need to strengthen the essentials of urban sanitation as flooding not only overwhelms sewer and drainage systems, it also spreads garbage and debris throughout the environment that increases chances of transient contact between humans and animals. Intensifying climate events and related environmental factors will continue to shape transmission of leptospirosis in places like Puerto Rico. Surveillance and predictive modeling efforts utilizing Geographic Information Science can help predict locations of future outbreaks with key factors, such as local infrastructure, rainfall effects, and human and animal population densities. Braiding climate-informed predictive analytics with hardened water, sanitation, and public health infrastructure will be essential to prevent endemic disease in Puerto Rico from becoming seasonal high mortality events. This figure shows how environmental forces impact the transmission of leptospirosis. =Health Care Systems= As a relatively small island with high levels of socioeconomic inequity before Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico lacked a health care infrastructure that was capable of withstanding and fully responding to Hurricane Maria. Beyond the destructive power of the storm and floods, weeks without power and clean water took an immense toll on countless patients and an already overburdened, overworked, and underpaid workforce. People with serious illnesses had their treatments interrupted for weeks, including many who required dialysis for kidney failure. Disruptions in treatment for diabetes and other chronic illnesses underscore Puerto Rico's profound health inequities, thereby exacerbating the high rates of preventable and poorly treated physical illnesses linked to poverty, mental health and substance use issues in the aftermath of the hurricane. A key intersection of environmental and occupational health and leptospirosis prevention is the activity of health care, emergency response, and other disaster relief workers after heavy rainfall and flooding events. As paramedics, rescue workers, and residents wade through flood waters, they risk direct exposure to leptospira bacteria. This exposure can be mitigated with the use of protective clothing and gear, including proper coverage of wounds, but health care and emergency response systems in low-income urban environments often lack the awareness, training, and material resources necessary to put those precautions in place. Proper bandages, waterproof gear, abrasion-resistant gloves, and face coverings help reduce leptospirosis infections among people who have to move through flood waters. Prophylactic antibiotics to counter diseases like malaria and leptospirosis are also suggested for medical responders. The Puerto Rican government came under fire in the wake of Hurricane Maria for failing to provide protective equipment to relief workers who later contracted leptospirosis and died. For many Puerto Ricans with chronic illnesses, pharmacies were the first line of response to the disruption in health care services caused by Hurricane Maria, not primary care providers. Pharmacists reported that a lack of telecommunications, electronic health records, and other essential data posed additional health risks. Improving access to pharmaceutical services and removing bureaucratic obstacles to obtaining essential medications, including psychiatric prescriptions, is a key consideration in protecting public health in the face of growing weather and other disasters. =Socioeconomic Factors= Leptospirosis transmission is shaped by the complex intersections of climate, geography, and socioeconomic factors. In places like Puerto Rico, these factors converge to disproportionately affect people living in poor, urban areas that experience warm temperatures and heavy rainfall. Not only is the risk for leptospirosis in the environment higher in these areas, its potential deadliness as an infection is magnified by the adverse social determinants of health affecting people in these communities. Studies in low-income regions throughout the world indicate that, even controlling for environmental factors, socioeconomic status plays a major role in risk for leptospirosis and the severity of its effects. Communities with high levels of poverty experience higher likelihood of morbidity and mortality for leptospirosis attributable to relative socioeconomic status. To mitigate the risks associated with poverty, climate change, and endemic diseases like leptospirosis in Puerto Rico, the island's territorial government and the rest of the U.S. must address major underlying socioeconomic and political inequities. In workplace and shared public environments, many pathways for leptospirosis transmission can be addressed by waste removal and occupational health precautions. The prevalence of the disease in poor, urban areas complicates this approach, as private dwellings are more likely to become sites for contact between animals, contaminated water, soil, food, and humans. Residents of these impoverished communities typically lack the resources to address such environmental risks individually, and adverse socioeconomic factors pose additional barriers to implementing widespread prevention strategies. Many people in these areas also perform the majority of the labor to clean up in the wake of flooding, typically without any training or protective equipment. This cleaning activity has been shown to increase infections and spread leptospirosis throughout poor urban environments. In September 2018, millions of bottles of clean water from FEMA intended for hurricane victims were found on an airport runway in Ceiba, apparently never distributed due to government mismanagement.

A Harvard graduate who came to South America in the Consular Service, he became a student and proponent of Pan- Americanism. His pioneering 1915 book Inter-American Acquaintances proposed a new, Pan-American origin for the Monroe Doctrine. After being denied a permanent diplomatic appointment he worked for the Southern Railway and the Corn Exchange Bank; at the same time he became a respected independent scholar who helped found the Hispanic American Historical Review. Beside many articles on early inter-American relations, he co-authored an unpublished biography of Joel Roberts Poinsett. During World War II he worked in Brazil for the U.S. government, and before retirement he taught at Haverford, Georgetown and Ursinus. For his scholarship and promotion of good relations based on shared cultural values, Chandler achieved significant honors in several South American countries—but not in the United States. This, combined with scant attention to his scholarship, led his biographer to characterize him as a forgotten man. Early life Chandler was born in a Unitarian family, and would attribute a great influence to religious values of social progress and \\"perfect mutual toleration\\". His aunt Agnes Blake Poor encouraged a love of Spanish and Portuguese,Poor would publish Pan-American Poems in 1918 (Boston: Gorham Press), a translated anthology of Latin-American poetry. Mitiyo Morinaka, p. 129. while he took Latin and French in high school and studied German on his own. At Harvard College he focused on history and political science, studying under Frederick Jackson Turner, Edward Channing and Archibald Cary Coolidge before graduating magna cum laude in 1905.Avenius, \\"Charles Lyon Chandler\\", pp. 169–170. Consular service Already in Europe on a George W. Dillaway fellowship, Chandler obtained a job in the United States Consular Service as the secretary of the American envoy in Portugal, Charles Page Bryan. The State Department sent him to Japan, where he studied interpreting, and then to Formosa and Manchuria as vice consul. In 1908 he was sent to Montevideo, Uruguay—the beginning of his Latin American experience.Avenius, \\"Charles Lyon Chandler\\", pp. 170–171. Chandler wrote diverse reports for trade publications, such as arguing for American entrepreneurs to invest in Argentina rather than Japan or China. He was also returned to the United States to attend business conferences. Studying private international law at the University of Buenos Aires (after transferring to that consulate), he earned a certificate, and used university club life to interest Argentines in studying in the United States. He was the first foreign member of the university's Law Student's Club, and was active in the United States Universities Club of Buenos Aires as well as the Harvard Club of the River Plate.Avenius, \\"Charles Lyon Chandler\\", p. 171. In August 1911, he began writing Inter-American Acquaintances. The first chapter appeared the next month and the completed book in 1915 (Sewanee, Tennessee: University Press), with a second edition in 1917. Predating other early works on Pan-American relations, his biographer asserts that \\"Chandler's publications must be considered precursors to the pioneers\\".Avenius, \\"Charles Lyon Chandler\\", p. 172. According to a contemporary review: Chandler was transferred to Callao, Peru, to serve as vice and deputy consul. The newspaper El Diario reported that \\"Chandler is a true American, inasmuch as he truly reflects reality; he is very much a latino in his fine projects and in his ideas and conceptions.\\" El Diario (Lima), October 29, 1911, quoted in Avenius, \\"Charles Lyon Chandler\\", p. 173. He was elected to Lima's National Club, founded a United States Universities Club of Peru and enrolled at the University of San Marcos. In January 1914, however, the State Department informed him that he failed the entrance examination for permanent appointment to the Diplomatic Service.Avenius, \\"Charles Lyon Chandler\\", pp. 171–172.

Leaving diplomacy, Chandler sustained himself with business jobs instead, working as an agent for the Southern Railway from 1914 to 1918, and as foreign trade manager for the Corn Exchange Bank of Philadelphia from 1918 to 1942. He continued lecturing, organizing tours and publishing scholarly articles related to inter-American affairs. He helped organize and fund the Hispanic American Historical Review,Chapman, \\"Founding of the Review\\", pp. 12–16. and wrote some of its first articles. In 1924 he discovered the tomb of the first Colombian ambassador to the United States, Manuel Torres, in Philadelphia.Avenius, \\"Charles Lyon Chandler\\", pp. 174-176, 180.

This \\"most important historical effort of his career\\"Avenius, \\"Charles Lyon Chandler\\", p. 177 was upset, however, when J. Fred Rippy and Herbert E.

While Chandler sharply criticized these books in the Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, stressing that \\"neither can be considered a definitive and final biography\\",Chandler, \\"Book Reviews\\", pp. 84–86. it did not prevent his own work from being rejected by Princeton's and Harvard's university presses. The manuscript was revised but never published. Following a switch to the Democratic Party in the 1920s, Chandler became a supporter of Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s, exchanging some personal letters with the president. When the United States entered World War II, Chandler left banking for a job with the government's Rubber Development Corporation. He worked in Washington as well as Brazil, and in September 1943 moved to the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs in Rio de Janeiro. He discovered the tomb of early American diplomat William Tudor there, and was popular in the Brazilian press.Avenius, \\"Charles Lyon Chandler\\", pp. 178–180.

He is also a Group Leader at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (German: Deutsches Zentrum für Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen, (DZNE)) in Tübingen. Jucker is known for his research on the basic biologic mechanisms underlying brain aging and Alzheimer’s disease.  Education and career  Jucker received his doctoral degree (1988) in Natural Sciences from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich (ETH Zürich), after which he began his research on aging in the brain at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) in Baltimore, United States, and then at the University of Basel (Switzerland). In 2003 he became Full Professor of Cell Biology of Neurological Diseases at the University of Tübingen. In 2009 he was named a Group Leader at the DZNE in Tübingen, and in 2012 he became the founding coordinator of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer’s Disease Network (DIAN) in Germany.  Research  = Prion-like properties of disease-causing proteins = Jucker’s research has focused on understanding how certain proteins cause disease by adopting abnormal 3-dimensional shapes (conformations) in the nervous system. In collaboration with Lary Walker at Emory University, Jucker was the first to show in experimental mice that the accumulation of abnormally folded proteins in Alzheimer’s disease occurs by a prion-like mechanism. The prion concept has since been expanded to include several other proteins, including tau and α-synuclein, which similarly misfold and aggregate in a class of diseases known as proteopathies. = Biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease = Jucker also has contributed to the development and validation of biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. He found that changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in mouse models closely resemble the changes in humans with Alzheimer’s disease, and he and his colleagues showed that a protein in neurons known as neurofilament light chain can serve as a biomarker in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid that can be used to determine the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease.

His other art names include Hekiin Sambō (壁陰 山房), Kyūan (休庵), Shikyūan (四休庵) and Takukadō (琢華堂).  Life and work  He was the son of a Samurai who was a retainer of the Shogunate and served as head of the Spear Corps. His father died when he was seven and, following the hereditary system, he was trained in martial arts and horsemanship. He was personally more inclined to an artistic career, however and, to help supplement his meager income, began to study painting. His first lessons came from , followed by Tani Bunchō and, lastly, at the age of seventeen, with Watanabe Kazan; becoming his favorite student. In 1839, when Kazan was caught up in the \\"Bansha no goku\\" and imprisoned, Tsubaki was part of the team that rescued him. After Kazan committed seppuku in 1841, he helped raise his son, , and gave him painting lessons. As a result of this affair, he resigned from the Samurai service. He painted portraits of many of his associates in the Japanese art world, which show some European influence. His other works, mostly flowers and birds, are firmly grounded in traditional styles. At the age of fifty, he designed two six piece screens (Byōbu). The second, featuring orchids and bamboo (蘭竹図屏風), is one of his most familiar works and is known as the \\"Ranchiku Screen\\" in English. It was said that he was very austere; refraining from alcohol, smoking and, until he was married, female companionship. He also slept little. In addition to painting, he wrote haiku, practiced the tea ceremony and played the shō. His son, , was also a talented painter, but died at the age of twenty-six, before his father.

Waddell and written by Waddell and Michael Simon. It stars Jack Falahee, Hannah Hodson, Alice Kremelberg, Conor Leslie, Jesse McCartney, and Ritesh Rajan as students on a college campus where strange occurrences begin to take place. Scorsese's father Martin and his collaborator Ray Liotta also make cameo appearances in the film. Originally entitled Campus Life, the film was created as original content for the website JumpView in 2013, where the storylines of individual characters would be viewed separately or switched between manually. The footage was later re-edited into a conventional film, which became Campus Code. To date, it is JumpView's only original film. Plot College student Becca begins to notice strange events on her campus, which become more apparent when she sees classmate Ari fall from a great height and appear unharmed. The two attempt to uncover the secrets of their campus while being antagonized by Elliot, the student who caused Ari to fall. Meanwhile, Ari's friend Arun and his girlfriend Izzy are blackmailed by the Griefers, a group of students who want complete free will on the campus. Arun confides in Greta, a new student he meets, that his parents are forcing him into an arranged marriage and he has locked his parents in his closet. During a party, Elliot abruptly disintegrates and an earthquake appears to affect the campus. Only Becca, Ari, Arun, and Izzy appear to witness these events, however, and suddenly find themselves being hunted by the campus' security guards. Izzy now claims she cannot remember why she was being blackmailed and the Griefers are disintegrated before they can reveal her secret. Greta helps the guards capture Izzy, but is also disintegrated for letting Arun escape. Ari, Becca, and Arun attempt to leave the campus through its exit, only to end up back at the entrance while a strange entity appears in the sky and begins actively trying to kill them. They manage to evade the entity and reunite with Izzy as they look for a place to hide. It is soon revealed that the events on the campus have been taking place inside a video game and the students are avatars controlled by players. Arun is a young Indian man who resents being forced into an arranged marriage, Greta is the young Indian woman arranged to marry Arun and was playing the game to meet him, Izzy is a male catfish and cross-dresser, and Ari's player has been using the game to generate income. Ari, Arun, and Izzy, however, all escaped from their players' control and gained sentience, while Becca is implied to be a virus who escaped quarantine and inadvertently infected the other three. Responsible for the attempts on their lives are the game's programmers to prevent them from infecting other avatars. Upon realizing the truth, Arun, Izzy, Ari, and Becca question what their next move should be. After some deliberation, Becca states that they will contact their creators. Cast * Jesse McCartney as Ari ** David Meyers as Real Life Ari * Hannah Hodson as Becca * Ritesh Rajan as Arun ** Shivantha Wijesinha as Real Life Arun * Alice Kremelberg as Izzy ** Chris Dwan as Real Life Izzy * Conor Leslie as Greta ** Shikha Jaim as Real Life Greta / Prana * Jack Falahee as Elliot * Chris Cafero as Griefer Leader * Jessica Alexandra Green as Jennifer * Ray Liotta as Bartender * Martin Scorsese as Doctor Production Campus Code was created as original content for the website JumpView, which edits the footage of films and television series to allow viewers to switch between the perspectives of different characters or watch them entirely from the perspective of one character. The film was conceived by JumpView founders Michael Simon and Kenneth M. Waddell to help launch the website, with both serving as co-writers and co-producers and Waddell editing and co-directing. Cathy Scorsese, a friend of Waddell's from attending the New York University Tisch School of the Arts together, joined as a co-producer and co-director. Scorsese was reportedly responsible for the cameo appearances from her father Martin and his Goodfellas collaborator Ray Liotta. First released under the title Campus Life in 2013, viewers would watch the storylines of Ari, Becca, Arun, Izzy, and Greta separately, with the option of switching to another storyline at any time, and at least two storylines had to be viewed in their entirety to see the film's ending. Campus Code is a re-edit of the original release's footage, turning it into a conventional film. Filming took place at the Florham Park campus of Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison, New Jersey. Lawsuits In 2013, co-director Cathy Scorsese filed legal action against JumpView Entertainment, alleging that she was fraudulently promised 25 percent of the company's profits in an oral agreement. JumpView co-founders Michael Simon and Kenneth M. Waddell filed a lawsuit against Scorsese the same year for alleged conversion, commercial disparagement, tortious interference, breach of contract, and defamation and demanded at least $350,000 in damages. Through their lawsuit, Simon and Waddell alleged that Scorsese reneged on promises she made during the production, demonstrated erratic behavior throughout filming, and prevented the film from being promoted. The lawsuit against Scorsese was dismissed in 2014.

He is associated with the development of 14 bridges. As of 2018, they cumulatively transit over 400 million vehicles per year. His most notable project, the George Washington Bridge, achieved multiple world records including span length, cofferdam size, and use of deflection; earning the designation \\"Eighth Wonder of the World.\\" Le Corbusier called it \\"the most beautiful bridge in the world.\\" As of 2018, it is the busiest motor vehicle bridge on earth, transiting over 1 billion vehicles from 2008-2018. It is also home to the world's largest free-flying American flag and was featured on the History Channel series Modern Marvels. Case was named after his third great-grandfather, William Montgomery, who was a colonel in the America Revolutionary War. During the New York and New Jersey Campaign, Colonel Montgomery's regiment retreated from Fort Washington across the Hudson River to Fort Lee. One hundred and fifty one years later, Case erected the George Washington Bridge at the same location. Career Montgomery Case was born in Monmouth, Illinois, to Lyman and Carrie (née Rice) Case. His uncle, Thomas Munger, was a major influence on his career. From his guidance, Case attended the University of Nebraska from 1902-1904 and graduated from the University of Illinois in 1906 with a bachelor of science in civil engineering. He was a member of Delta Tau Delta. After graduation, he married Maybelle Betsy McConnell (b.1880—d.1945) in 1910 and began working with Ralph Modjeski on the Columbia River Railroad Bridge, followed by several more projects into the early 1920s. Throughout the 1920s he worked with Othmar Ammann. Following the death of Clement E. Chase, who was killed during an inspection of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, Case returned to Modjeski in 1933 and became a full partner alongside Frank M. Masters, forming Modjeski, Masters, and Case. He retired in 1940. Case also served as an advisor to the War Manpower Commission, chief construction engineer for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and regularly lectured at Princeton University.

The Blue Diamond Society organizes the march, which celebrates cross-dressing. Blue Diamond Society organizes, and brings LGBT people to dance on the streets during this festival. Unlike other Pride marches in Nepal, it isn't seen as a political movement, but a celebration of an existing festival.  History  The Gai Jatra Pride Parades began in 2010. = 2010 = On 25 August 2010 the first Pride Festival was held in Kathmandu. It featured around 2000 participants from various countries such as India, Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark and Norway. The march included Irish lawmaker Dominique Hanningan and British Ambassador to Nepal John Tucknott. The parade was led by Sunil Pant, the first openly gay member of the Nepalese Parliament. Men and women marched wearing costumes, animal ensembles and masks. The March was in contrast to earlier marches when participants hid their faces. The march included human rights organisations and politicians. = 2011 = In August 2011, the parade took place in the town of Biratnagar in order to increase awareness in rural areas. The same year Nepal became the first country in the world to include a third gender on its federal census. = 2012 = On 3 August, the third parade took place in Lakeside, Pokhara. The festival drew supporters from local people as well as the tourists. The theme of the Gaijatra festival was \\"Bringing Friends and Families Together for Solidarity towards Equality, Protecting Mountain Eco-systems and Promoting ‘Visit Lumbini Year 2012’ in Nepal.\\" The parade ended with the candle memorial in the memory of the victims of the Seti River flood. = 2013 = 4th Gai jatra pride festival in Nepal 2013In 2013, the pride parade took place on 22 August in Kathmandu.

Thousands of people gathered to watch as over 500 members of the LGBT community paraded, carrying rainbow banners. The theme for the parade was \\"The constitutions will cement the hopes cracked by the earthquake, Avoid gender-based discrimination while rebuilding the structures\\". The event started from Thamel gateway and ended with cable light remembering those who died the 2015 Nepal earthquake. One staff member of Blue Diamond Society and one transgender person who died were memorialized. = 2016 = Almost a thousand people took part in the seventh Pride Parade in Kathmandu on August 19. The parade demanded equality and an end to discrimination for LGBTQ people, which continued despite a constitutional ban on discrimination based on sexuality. US Ambassador Alaina B Teplitz was a supporter. The Blue Diamond Society received support from the United Nations Development Program (under the Global Fund MSA program), Royal Norwegian Embassy and Open Society Foundation. = 2017 = A month before the eighth Pride Parade took place on August 8, a transgender women and her husband were issued a marriage certificate.

The country has various legislation emphasizing equality. However, Chapter 3 of Civil Code, part 1, article 67, which discusses marriage laws, does not recognize same-sex marriage.  Criticisms  Locals including LGBT people from Newar community criticized Blue Diamond Society for establishing Pride Parade during a festival of humor and jokes. Newar people who traditionally celebrate the Gai Jatra (Saa Paaru) festival commented that the festival was meant to elevate jokes and humor, making LGBT issues into a joke. Voices were raised against its unilateral decision to convert a traditional festival into something else. The celebration led to cultural conflict in Kathmandu. Blue Diamond Society pay NPR 1000 per individual for participating in the Pride Parade. Blue Diamond Society was attacked for discarding the traditional essence of the festival. The traditional festival of Gai Jatra(Saa Paaru) featured people crossdressing as entertainment. They protested that the gender identity of a transgender woman was equated to a cisgender man crosdressing. A campaign named Not a Mockery - No Pride on Gaijatra was begun on social media protesting the parade.  Conflicts  Critics such as Sunil Babu Panta assert that the Third Gender March during Gai Jatra is an extension of the festival and not a pride parade per se.

The Pampean flat-slab is the low angle subduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath Northern Argentina. The Pampean flat-slab is one of three flat slabs in South America, the other being the Peruvian flat-slab and the Bucaramanga flat-slab. It is thought that the subduction of Juan Fernández Ridge, a chain of extinct volcanoes in Nazca Plate, is the underlying cause of the Pampean flat-slab. Effects The shallowing of subducted slab beneath north-central Chile and Argentina is linked to a series of changes in volcanism and tectonics. =Deformation of crust= The flat-slab has caused an uplift of Sierras Pampeanas which begun first in the north and then moved southwards over millions of years. The oldest noted uplift episode associated with Pampean flat-slab is that of Sierra de Aconquija (27 °S) from 7.6 to 6 million years ago (Ma) in the Late Miocene epoch. This was followed by the uplift of massifs further south such as Sierra de Famatina (29 °S) that rose 4.5 to 4.19 Ma ago. Next to rise was Sierra de Pocho (31 °S) 5.5 to 4.7 Ma ago followed by Sierra de San Luis (33 °S) 2.6 Ma Ago. At latitude 33 °S deformation of the Andes proper has changed as the slab underneath has gradually shallowed. Thrust front propagation of the Principal Cordillera has increased five-fold in from 15-9 Ma ago to the Pliocene and Early Quaternary. Slightly east the Frontal Cordillera was greatly uplifted 9 million years ago. =Volcanic gap= The Pampean flat-slab has also caused a lull in the volcanism in the Andes seen in the lack of modern volcanoes between the Central Andean Volcanic Zone and the Southern Andean Volcanic Zone. As the flat slab migrated from west to east under South America, so did volcanic activity, until it vanished 1.9 Ma ago, about from the Pacific, far to the east of ordinary subduction volcanism. Migration of the volcanic activity to the east meant that in the Principal Cordillera magmatic activity ended as early as 8.6 Ma ago.

In June 2019, she was arrested for docking a migrant rescue ship without authorization in the port of Lampedusa, Italy. Early life Rackete was born in Preetz, near Kiel, Germany. She graduated high school in 2007, then studied at Maritime School at Jade University of Applied Sciences in Elsfleth, earning a Bachelor of Science in nautical science and maritime transport in 2011. The B.Sc. in Nautical science at Jade University meets the written examination requirement for the captain's licence of the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany, which is later acquired on the basis of professional experience only. In 2018 she earned a master's degree in conservation management from Edge Hill University in England. Career Rackete was a navigation officer for two years in scientific expeditions in the Arctic and the Antarctic for the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research. For a short period of time, she worked as a conservation volunteer within the Kronotsky Nature Reserve in the Kamchatka Peninsula. Later, Carola Rackete worked as safety officer for Silversea Cruises, an ultra-luxury cruise line headquartered in Monaco. She later worked as second-officer on ships owned by Greenpeace and the British Antarctic Survey. As of June 2019 Rackete captained , a vessel of 645 gross tonnage, which flies a Dutch flag. Sea-Watch 3 incident of June 2019 On 12 June, the ship picked up 53 migrants in the Mediterranean off the Libyan coast. Sea-Watch 3 rejected an offer to dock at Tripoli, which is considered unsafe by the European Union and the humanitarian organizations, and headed toward Lampedusa. According to a map they posted, and also to a report by the Süddeutsche Zeitung and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) this was the nearest safe harbor per maritime law. On 14 June, Italy closed its ports to migrant rescue ships. Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini refused to allow the ship to dock until other European nations had agreed to take the migrants. Ten of the migrants, including children, pregnant women, and those who were ill, were allowed to disembark. On 28 June, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Portugal offered to take the migrants. On 29 June, without authorization, Rackete decided to dock. The motivation for this was that according to her the passengers were exhausted. Rackete was arrested by the Italian authorities after docking. Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini accused Rackete of trying to sink an Italian patrol boat that was trying to intercept her and that her ship collided with, calling the incident an act of war and demanding the Netherlands intervene. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte \\"scrambled to address the matter\\" at the 2019 G20 Osaka summit. Germany protested the arrest. Crowdfunding appeals in Italy and Germany had raised over €1 million as of 1 July for Sea-Watch legal defense. Fortune called Rackete the \\"fresh new face\\" of the European migrant crisis. Sea-Watch 3 has a mainly German crew but sailed under Dutch flag. In the Netherlands, main government party VVD stated that NGOs that deliberately without permission pick up people should be convicted for facilitating human trafficking. Spokesman Jeroen van Wijngaarden said that: \\"They are factually not a rescue service but a ferry service.\\" Within the Dutch coalition government, they got support from the CDA, and in the Dutch parliament there basically was a majority that supported this. Nevertheless, the two other parties in the coalition government protested strongly against this statement. Eventually, Rackete was released from house arrest after a court ruling that she had broken no laws and acted to protect passengers' safety. Rackete's lawyer filed a lawsuit against Salvini for defamation on social media, alleging that he incited his followers to threaten her. The council of the City of Paris on 12 July 2019 announced that the two captains of Sea-Watch 3, Pia Klemp and Carola Rackete, will receive the Grand Vermeil Medal, the top award of the City of Paris, for saving migrants at sea, because the two captains symbolized \\"solidarity for the respect of human lives\\". Both refused the medal, defining this decision \\"hypocritical\\". Klempt wrote in a statement: \\"You want to award me a medal...because our crews 'work' to rescue migrants from difficult conditions on a daily basis. At the same time your police steal blankets from people you force to live on the streets while you suppress protests and criminalise people who defend the rights of migrants and asylum seekers.\\" As of July 2019, Rackete was under investigation by Italian authorities for possible criminal activities in regards to undocumented migration. If convicted, Rackete would have faced up to 15 years in prison. In January 2020, on appeal the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation ruled that Rackete should never have been arrested. In October 2020, Carola Rakete was awarded the first award.

Early life Arturo Magni was born in Usmate Velate, near Milan in the Lombardy region of Italy on 24 September 1925. His main passion was for model aeroplanes, where he showed great technical creativeness in building them. He built life-size gliders, which he flew himself, and won the 1938 Italian Gliding Championship. After leaving school, he worked for his father for a while and then joined the aviation industry, working for the Italian manufacturer Bestetti. Gilera The story of Arturo Magni in the world of two wheels began in 1947 when he joined Gilera. The company had decided to participate in the 500 cc World Championship and had commissioned Pietro Remor to build a new four-cylinder GP engine. Remor was impressed by Magni's talents, and at Remor's insistence, Magni joined the R&D; departement to assist in building the new engine. This engine powered Gilera to six world titles in the 500 class with the riders Umberto Masetti, Libero Liberati and Geoff Duke. MV Agusta Count Domenico Agusta was determined to make MV Agusta one of the leading motorcycle marques. In 1950 Augusta hired Pietro Remor to build two GP machines: a four-cylinder 500 cc and a DOHC 125 cc. To assist him in this project, Remor brought Magni with him from Gilera as chief mechanic. Soon Magni became Direttore Sportivo (director of the racing department) under the watchful eye of the Count. His technical expertise was fundamental in developing the world-beating 350 and 500 cc \\"Threes\\" in the 1960s and the \\"Fours\\" in the 1970s. Magni held this position until the marque withdrew from competition in 1976. He had employed riders such as Giacomo Agostini, John Surtees, Carlo Ubbiali, Phil Read, Mike Hailwood, Cecil Sandford and Tarquinio Provini. The Varese-based company, under Magni's guidance, won a total of 75 world titles (37 manufacturers and 38 riders). After the withdrawal from racing, Magni stayed on at MV as superintendent of the MV Agusta museum. Cagiva In 1980, Magni was head of the race shop at Cagiva. He was in charge of development of a new four- cylinder racing two-stroke. The engine, which was a development of the Yamaha TZ 500 engine, was first used by Virginio Ferrari the 1980 German motorcycle Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. Motorcycle manufacturer From 1977 he began his career as an entrepreneur founding the house that bears his name, along with his two sons. The company, based in a small but fully equipped workshop, was located at Samarate, 20 miles from the MV factory. Initial the company manufactured special parts for the MV Agusta 750 S motorcycles, such as chain drive conversions, big-bore kits and frame kits. Later, in 1980, the company progressed to the construction of complete motorcycles. The first models were power by Honda CB900F engines (models MH1 & MH2). Later BMW R100 (MB1 & MB2) and various Moto Guzzi engines were used. The Sfida 1000 model, introduced in 1989, used a Moto Guzzi engine in a machine styled to reflect the MV racers of the 1960s. (Sfida means \\"challenge\\" in Italian). In 1999, models based on the four-cylinder Suzuki Bandit 1200 engine were added.

It was reported in 2018 that Korean Air's lease expires in March 2021, and that a bidding process was open to secure a new lease. Government officials said that low-cost carriers might be requested to submit bids, in addition to those requested of Asiana Airlines and Korean Air. The chosen aircraft will undergo a \\"full-scale renovation\\" which will include \\"decorating the exterior\\", as well as customizing the interior to include a sleeping area and office, as well as reinforcement to protect the president's security. As of May 2020 the South Korean Government has chosen the Boeing 747-8I Intercontinental as the new Code One.

It is a member of the genus Erysimum, which includes between 150 and 350 species in the Northern Hemisphere.  Description  Erysimum crepidifolium is an annual to short-lived perennial herbaceous plant that has upright stems, reaching a height of up to 60 cm. The leaves are hirsute, with margins ranging from dentate to entire. Flowering occurs primarily from April until July. More rarely, E. crepidifolium plants also produce flowers in the fall.The odorless flowers are relatively large, reaching lengths of 9 to 15 mm. The four petals have a pale yellow color. There are six anthers. The 20 to 70 mm seed pods are gray-green, four-sided with rounded corners, and have 3 to 5 mm stems. The species has a 2n = 14 chromosome number. = Similar species = Erysimum crepidifolium is most easily confused with Erysimum hieraciifolium or Erysimum marschallianum. The latter is differentiated primarily by the shape of the trichomes.  Occurrence  Erysimum crepidifolium grows in dry meadows, preferring warm, rocky soils. The species occurs naturally from the Balkans and Italy to southern and central Germany. However, it is uncommon in Germany, where it is found most frequently in the middle Saale and Nahe river valleys. Other reported sites are in northern Bavaria and southwestern Germany. It is not native in Switzerland or Austria.  Chemical toxicity  Like most members of the genus Erysimum, E. crepidifolium contains both cardiac glycosides (cardenolides), and glucosinolates. All parts of E. crepidifolium are toxic due to their cardenolide content. There are at least 20 different cardenolides in the seeds, making up ~3.5% of the total mass. Among these, the most common are erysimoside (~2.3%) and its deglycosylated form helveticoside (0.5–1.2%). The highest concentrations of erysimoside and helveticoside are found during ripening and in drying seeds. Among 48 tested Erysimum species, E. crepidifolium had the highest cardenolide content in the leaves, at least three-fold higher than any of the other species. Toxicity in humans has not been reported, though mass die-offs of geese are known. Consumption of E. crepidifolium by geese leads to muscle paralysis from which the animals eventually die (hence the German common name \\"Gänsesterbe“, or geese death, for this species). Rabbits are also considered susceptible, but chickens are reportedly resistant to E. crepidifolium toxicity.  Molecular biology  Due to its close phylogenetic relationship with the well-studied model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, E. crepidifolium has been proposed as a suitable system for investigating the cardenolide biosynthetic pathway. Progesterone 5-beta-reductase, which was initially proposed as an enzyme of cardenolide biosynthesis in Digitalis, also has been cloned from E. crepidifolium. However, the natural substrate of this E. crepidifolium enzyme has not yet been identified. 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases represent another enzyme class that is predicted to be involved in cardenolide biosynthesis. Comparison to A. thaliana genes identified three predicted 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases in E. crepidifolium (EcHSD1, EcHSD2, and EcHSD3). In vitro assays showed that all three enzymes catalyze the dehydrogenation of pregnenolone and the 3-reduction of 5-alpha/beta-pregnane-3,20-dione. Whereas EcHSD1 expression was not induced by tested stress conditions, EcHSD2 expression was upregulated by osmotic stress, and EcHSD3 expression was upregulated by both osmotic stress and treatment with methyl jasmonate, an endogenous elicitor of chemical defenses in many plant species.

Two of his collieries, Khas Jharia and Golden Jharia, which worked on maximum 260-foot-deep shafts, collapsed due to now infamous underground fires, in which their house and bungalow also collapsed on 8 November 1930, causing 18 feet subsidence and widespread destruction.Gazetteers of Bengal, Assam, Bihar & Orissa 1917 Khora Ramji ColliriesKhora Ramji Mines capsized in 1938Diary of Golden Days at Jharia – A Memoir & History of Gurjar Kashtriya Samaj of Kutch in Coalfields of Jharia – written by Natwarlal Devram Jethwa:1998 Page:12Nanji Bapa ni Nondh-pothi published in Gujarati in year 1999 from Vadodara.

The 1934 Nepal–Bihar earthquake led to further spread of fire and by 1938 the authorities had declared that there is raging fire beneath the town with 42 collieries out of 133 on fire.Searchlight, 24 January 1936. In 1972, more than 70 mine fires were reported in this region. As of 2007, more than 400,000 people who reside in Jharia are living on land in danger of subsidence due to the fires, and according to Satya Pratap Singh, \\"Jharia township is on the brink of an ecological and human disaster\\".Hindustan Times, 15 December 2007 The government has been criticized for a perceived lackadaisical attitudeThe Jharia mine fire control technical assistance project: an analysis, April 2004 towards the safety of the people of Jharia.\\"Inside Coal Mine Fires\\", a documentary, 2005 Heavy fumes emitted by the firesESTIMATION OF GAS EMISSIONS FROM SHALLOW SUBSURFACE COAL FIRES IN JHARIA COALFIELD lead to severe health problems such as breathing disorders and skin diseases among the local population.In the line of fire, indiatogether.org =Fire in the PB Area= There are 6 fire-affected sites in Pootkee Balihari Area.

He began archery aged three by his father, Kevin Sr., who owned an archery shop and began competing aged eleven. In 1999, Polish was involved in a car accident and suffered life-changing injuries and he went back to competitive archery in 2000 after his rehabilitation. He won his first medal in the 2005 World Archery Championships along with Dave Cousins and Braden Gellenthien. Car accident On October 9, 1999, Polish went deer hunting with his friends. After 3 hours of hunting, they decided to go on a dirt track road driving at 30 mph. A flock of turkeys went onto the road in front of the car that Polish was driving, he swerved his car to avoid the birds, applied his brakes and his car went off the road and into a 100 ft embankment. Polish got the car in control before his car hit a 2 ft tree stump which resulted in his car to jackknife and roll the car multiple times down the hill, he was thrown out of the vehicle (even though he was wearing a seatbelt), the impact of the crash was so severe that the seatbelt broke and the buckle detached itself and he hit into a tree and broke his back. After Polish hit the ground, he heard his friends calling for him, once he put his hands on the ground to push himself up he then heard a \\"pop\\": he only had his chest off the ground but the middle part of his body was turned around and he grabbed a part of his leg but couldn't feel anything. When the paramedics arrived, they had to use the jaws of life to get Polish out of the tree. =Hospital stay= Polish stayed in hospital for four months from October 1999 to January 2000, for the first two weeks, Polish couldn't speak or open his eyes. The doctors had diagnosed that he broke his back from T7 to T10 and they put in screws, bolts and clamps to repair Polish's back, the doctors told Polish that he wouldn't be able to sit or stand.

Organisational overview In 1997, Moonidih project, which was earlier treated as a separate Area was merged with what was earlier the Mahuda Area. The Moonidih project was initiated as a National Coal Development Corporation project with Polish collaboration in 1964. The collieries under what was earlier the Mahuda Area were owned by private companies before their nationalisation. Bhatdih colliery and Murlidih 20/21 pits colliery belonged to Bengal Coal Company. Several small mines amalgamated after nationalisation as Lohapatti colliery earlier belonged to different private companies. Geography =Location= The Western Jharia Area office is located at . The map alongside shows some of the collieries in the Area. However, as the collieries do not have individual pages, there are no links in the full screen map. Western Jharia Area comprises two separate coal blocks- Moonidih coal block and Mahuda coal block. While Moonidih coal block is located in west- central part of Jharia Coalfield, Mahuda coal basin is situated in the western part of Jharia coalfield. The two blocks are separated by a few kilometres in between. While Moonidih is about 12 km from Dhanbad Junction railway station, Mahuda is about 10 km. Both the places are accessible from National Highway 18 (old number NH 32) / (locally popular as Dhanbad-Bokaro Highway). The Moonidih block is bounded by Loyabad mine on the north, Bhagaband mine and TISCO on the east, Kapuria block on the west and Damodar River on the south. The Mahuda block is bounded by Madhuban mine and a part of Govindpur Area on the north, Kapuria block on the east, Jamunia River on the west and Damodar River on the south. Coal mines Western Jharia Area is a predominantly underground mining zone having some small patches of open cast mines with a short-term perspective. The main units are: Moonidih Project, Murlidih 20/21 pits colliery, Bhatdih colliery and Lohapatty colliery. Pilot Project for Coal Bed Methane recovery and commercial utilisation in Moonidih coal block is under UNDP/GEF/ Government of India with BCCL, CMPDIL and ONGC as implementing agencies. The objective is to recover Coal Bed Methane gas through boreholes, 1,000 m to 1,150m in depth, from virgin gassy coal seams. Mining activities *Moonidih colliery: Since inception Moonidih was designed for high levels of production utilising Longwall mechanisation. In 1978 the first ever Powered Support Longwall (PSLW) technology in the country was deployed in this colliery. Moonidih is also distinctive for its deep shafts going down to depths of 545m and 560m. It is amongst the deepest collieries in India. It has high capacity Kopae winders, integrated coal washery and captive power plant. Moonidih adopts horizon mining techniques. Coal evacuation from the mine is through a series of belt conveyors. Moonidih has built underground bunkerage of 1,800 tonnes. Mining at great depths in a highly gassy environment, high levels of mechanisation and long haulages requires special efforts at mine ventilation. In 1988-89 the project achieved its peak production level of 1.2 million tonnes. *Murlidih 20/21 pits colliery: Of the two seams in the mine Mahuda Bottom Seam has virtually been exhausted and Mahuda Top Seam is being worked by Bord and Pillar method with SDL. In 2009, a fire broke out in the belt incline of the mine. The fire and associated problems were taken care of with new arrangements for coal transportation. Murlidih open cast patch is being worked for extraction of balance coal left in the outcrop region of Mahuda top seam. *Lohapatti colliery: The colliery has thin seams with comparatively steep gradient. The mine is producing non-coking long flame grade B & grade C coal. *Bhatdih colliery: The colliery stopped operations after the firedamp explosion in Mahuda bottom seam in Incline No.17 on 6 September 2006, killing 50 persons. The seams in the mine are categorized as of degree-III gassiness. Mining plan Moonidih colliery is an operating underground colliery. With a normative annual production capacity of 4.2 million tonnes per year and peak annual production capacity of 5.2 million tonnes per year, it had an expected life of more than 50 years. Moonidih washery has an annual capacity of 1.6 million tonnes per year. Murlidih 20/21 pits colliery is an operating underground mine. It has a normative annual production capacity of 0.18 million tonnes per year and peak annual production capacity of 2.34 million tonnes per year References Category:Coal mining operational areas in Jharkhand ","title":"Western Jharia Area"},{"id":"61171560","text":"Gabriel Ferrand (1864–1935) was a French orientalist specialised on the Madagascar.

Life  Appleby was born in 1689, as Susanna Maria Gilpin, daughter of William Gilpin (1657–1724) at Scaleby Castle, Cumberland. Her grandfather was Richard Gilpin, a prominent nonconformist minister and physician while her father was a minister who became Recorder of Carlisle in 1718. Appleby's mother was Mary, daughter of Henry Fletcher of Tallantire, Cumberland. Appleby married Joseph Dacre Appleby and had eight children, three of her sons dying young. They lived at Kirklevington Hall in Kirklevington. Appleby died in 1769.  Excavations  The altar discovered in ca. 1791 (RIB 1978) Joseph Dacre Appleby owned the land on which Camboglanna was situated, and employed men to dig at the site for stone. After his death, in 1741, Susanna Appleby excavated a Roman bath house, in woodland north east of Camboglanna (Castlesteads Roman Fort). In William Hutchinson's 1794 volume on the history of the county of Cumberland, he publishes a letter written by the antiquarian Roger Gale with Appleby's description of the site. The bath house was discovered in woodland to the north east of the fort, where remains of the hypocaust system and paved flooring could still be seen in rooms of the bath house. An altar from the site was removed and carried to Appleby's house in 1741.RIB 1978 Altar dedicated to the Discipline of the Emperor(s). https://romaninscriptionsofbritain.org/inscriptions/1978#RIB In the same year, the antiquarian George Smith (1700–1773) visited the site and drew a plan of the site and inscriptions, later published in The Gentleman's Magazine. In his letters to The Gentleman's Magazine, Smith described how Appleby had found a clay flooring with pedestals, and commented that: > Mrs Appleby, who deserves to be gratefully remember'd by all Lovers of > Antiquity, took great Pains to preserve what she cou'd of those valuable > Remains of the Antients. Appleby's early work and observations at the site of Camboglanna in the 1740s are significant due to the later destruction of the fort during the construction of Castlesteads house and gardens in 1791. Eric Birley, in his 1961 work on Hadrian's Wall, described Appleby as 'the earliest female antiquary of whom we have a record in the Wall region.'

It is found in highland areas, including the table-top mountains (tepui), of southern Venezuela and the neighbouring parts of Brazil and Guiana. Its natural habitats are moist montane forests. The Tepui flycatcher was described by the English ornithologist Charles Chubb in 1919 as a subspecies of the ochre- bellied flycatcher. He coined the trinomial name Pipromorpha oleaginea roraimae and specified the type location as Mount Roraima in the southeastern corner of Venezuela. The specific epithet roraimae is a Latinized form of Mount Roraima. It was treated as a subspecies of McConnell's flycatcher (Mionectes macconnelli) by the American ornithologist Clyde Todd in 1921. It was split from the McConnell's flycatcher based on a study published in 2014 that showed that the two taxa differed in habitat choice, vocalization and display behaviour.

It was located in Stockwell, South London from 1860 to 1935 and then relocated to the grounds of Bromley Palace, Bromley until its closure in 1980. History The College was founded in 1860 on a site at Stockwell, South London, by the British & Foreign School Society, for the purpose of training teachers. This continued the work of the Quaker Joseph Lancaster who had previously trained teachers in his school at Southwark. In 1861 the 75 female students of Borough Road College were transferred to the new establishment. The college awarded degree and postgraduate courses. In 1935 the college relocated to Bromley Palace, the former palace of the Bishops of Rochester. The 18th century house was adapted and extended to provide accommodation for the 114 women students. During the Second World War (from 1940 to 1945) the college temporarily relocated to Watcombe Park, Devon. Postcard showing the college buildings (circa 1970s) On the return to Bromley in 1945, some buildings had been destroyed by bombs, public air raid shelters had been built on the site, high blast walls had been constructed that obscured some windows, the grounds had been let out to allotments, and the fabric of the Old Palace itself had been badly damaged. Over the following years some redevelopment and improvement of the site took place, and some temporary accommodation was found in Wanstead Road, a mile away from the site. The post-war building programme included: *1966 - The Ann Springman and Joseph Lancaster halls of residence (each accommodating 72 students) *1967 - Music House and West Lodge extension. *1968 - Thanet Hall of Residence (75 students) in Wanstead Road. Completion of North Wing, Rochester Wing and Library. *1969 - Adaptations in the Old Palace. *1970 - St. Blaise Building. By 1960 there were approximately 200 women students following one or two year courses of training leading to the Teacher’s Certificate, plus a small group of men and women following a one-year supplementary course in Mathematics. On 1st August 1960 responsibility for the college was transferred from the British and Foreign School Society to the Kent Education Committee. In April 1965, following the re-organisation of the Greater London Council and London Boroughs, the college buildings became the property of the London Borough of Bromley. The college became administered by a Joint Education Committee of Kent County Council and of the London Borough of Bromley. From 1961 to 1972 the college progressed towards the target of 1,200 students as set by the Department of Education & Science. From 1960 most students were admitted to the three-year initial teacher training course, which led to the Certificate in Education of the University of London. In 1968 a four year course leading to a Bachelor of Honours degree was introduced. In 1969 the college began to admit postgraduate students to a one-year course leading to the University’s Graduate Certificate in Education. Options were available for training for infant, junior and secondary age ranges, in a full range of subjects. In addition, the college offered a range of courses approved by the Department of Education & Science for serving teachers. This period of expansion and development was halted in December 1972 by publication of the UK government’s White Paper, “Education—a Framework for Expansion”. The government imposed a policy of regression with a reduction of teacher training places; the college’s allocation was reduced from a target of 400 in 1972 to one of 95 in 1977. Finally, in June 1977 the Secretary of State for Education directed that there should be no further intake for initial teacher training courses. To comply with government policy the college, while continuing its main and historic task of teacher education, actively moved into the broader spectrum of higher education. Courses were developed and validated by the University of London, leading to ordinary and honours degrees, which progressively replaced the Certificate in Education and B.Ed. education. From 1977 to 1980 student numbers were progressively reduced. Two degree programmes, Education with Educational Broadcasting, and Music with Film and Television Studies, were transferred to Christ Church College, Canterbury, for a September 1980 entry. The college closed on 31st August, 1980. The site became part of Bromley Civic Centre in 1982.

The assumed existence of this channel and other errors in Peary's maps reportedly caused the tragic loss of the leading team of the Denmark expedition to Greenland's Northeast Coast 1906–1908.Spencer Apollonio, Lands That Hold One Spellbound: A Story of East Greenland, 2008 p. 85 Geography Peary based his mapping of the area on observations he made in 1892 from Navy Cliff, located north of the Academy Glacier. From his perspective the channel allegedly connected the head of Independence Fjord in the east with the heads of Nordenskiöld Fjord and a parallel and misplaced \\"Chipp Inlet\\" in the west. There is a Chipp Sound that separates Sverdrup Island from smaller Elison Island, but it is located at the other end of Nordenskiöld Fjord, beyond its mouth. In Peary's map Independence Fjord was merely a short bay and further to the east Peary had drawn the coast of hypothetical \\"Academy Land\\" slanting southeastwards with the \\"East Greenland Sea\\" to the north. In the wake of the tragic outcome of the Denmark expedition's main team, many scholars were highly critical of Peary's cartographic errors, but Lauge Koch, who made detailed surveys of the area in the 1920s and 30s, took a more lenient view: { - valign=\\"top\\" Map of Northern Ellesmere Island and far Northern Greenland. } History In 1907 Ludvig Mylius-Erichsen (1872-1907), the ill-fated leader of the Denmark expedition, searched in vain for the Peary Channel in 1907 and was misled to his death by existing maps.G. Amdrup: Report on the Danmark Expedition to the North-East Coast of Greenland 1906–1908. In: Meddelelser om Grønland 41, 1913, pp. 1–270 Two years later Ejnar Mikkelsen (1880–1971), leader of the Alabama expedition, assumed that the channel existed, until he found Mylius-Erichsen's report in a cairn at the head of Danmark Fjord, where Mylius-Erichsen had written emphatically that: Finally Knud Rasmussen, during his First Thule Expedition, also realized in 1912 that Peary Land is a peninsula and corrections were made in the maps of northernmost Greenland printed after that date.Spencer Apollonio, Lands That Hold One Spellbound: A Story of East Greenland, 2008 p. 139 Not knowing about the non-existence of the Peary Channel beforehand, the leaders of these three expeditions had planned eventually to use the Peary Channel to reach the NW coast of Greenland for their return journey. Since 1892 it had taken a full twenty years after being put on the map to confirm that the Peary Channel had been a cartographic error.

Production This season features the first scripts credited to writers Max Cohn and Elisabeth Kiernan Averick. Comedian and writer Pete Holmes also both wrote and guest-starred in the two-part \\"Warrin' Priests\\" episodes, making him the third freelance writer to do so after Ricky Gervais and Seth Rogen. While in \\"Warrin' Priests\\" Holmes plays the character of Bode, he had previously guest-starred in season 30 premiere \\"Bart's Not Dead\\" as a different character. The episode \\"The Incredible Lightness of Being a Baby\\" was delayed from the previous season, with the original intent to air it instead of \\"I'm Just a Girl Who Can't Say D'oh\\" on April 7, 2019. The episode was put on hold after the show's producers decided to make a short film related to the episode involving Maggie and another baby named Hudson titled Playdate with Destiny as well. The short film premiered on February 29, 2020, attached to advanced screenings of the Disney/Pixar release Onward with \\"The Incredible Lightness of Being a Baby\\" serving as a sequel to it. This season was produced and aired during the COVID-19 pandemic which delayed or canceled the production of many television productions, but as an animated production, this took less of a toll on the show than most live-action ones. Executive producer James L. Brooks encouraged the staff to begin working from their homes in early March 2020, before California's stay-at-home order was declared. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in late March 2020, Al Jean stated, \\"Production hasn't skipped a day or lost a beat. We intend to do the 22 shows we were contracted to do... There's been no change in how we do things.\\" In April 2020, the show joined the rest of Fox's Animation Domination lineup in a partnership with Caffeine for the AniDom Beyond Show, a recap show hosted by Andy Richter. The hour-long program featured interviews with guests and live interactivity with fans online, with recaps for the episodes that aired through April and May. The Simpsons episode aired on April 26 featuring Al Jean, cast member Yeardley Smith and writer and guest star Pete Holmes.The Simpsons on Twitter On May 18, Matt Selman joined the show with other writers from the Fox Animation Domination lineup. Controversy It was during the run of this season that longtime voice actor Hank Azaria announced that he was officially stepping down from voicing Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, a character he had played since the episode \\"The Telltale Head\\" from the first season. The character and Azaria's portrayal of him had come under scrutiny since the release of Hari Kondabolu's 2017 documentary The Problem with Apu. Apu's portrayal came under scrutiny again when the Simpsons staff referenced the criticism as being too politically correct in the season 29 episode \\"No Good Read Goes Unpunished\\" which resulted in backlash from some people concerned about the issue who felt that the response was immature. Azaria said that it was a mutual decision made between himself and the senior staff, stating, \\"all we know there is I won't be doing the voice anymore unless there's some way to transition it or something.\\" Episodes Ratings  References  External links *Page from Fox, including streaming video of episodes Category:2019 American television seasons Category:2020 American television seasons Simpsons season 31 ","title":"The Simpsons (season 31)"},{"id":"61172001","title":"A.

Jones is a U.S. legal case that took place in the state of Alabama. The case was historical in it was the first attempt, at least in the state, to charge a pregnant woman for suffering a miscarriage. The case was of special interest to feminist groups and reproductive rights groups. The case was ultimately dismissed.  Background  Marshae Doricia Jones (born 1990) was five months pregnant when, on December 4, 2018, she involved herself in a physical altercation with Ebony Jemison, then a co-worker, outside of a Dollar General in Pleasant Grove, Alabama. At some point during the altercation, Jemison, stating that she felt threatened by Jones, fired a single gunshot at Jones while Jemison sat in her vehicle. The bullet struck Jones in the abdomen, causing a miscarriage. Initially, Jemison was charged with manslaughter but a grand jury failed to indict her based on the state's stand- your-ground law. Authorities subsequently charged Jones with manslaughter, saying the fetus was the only victim of the situation and that Jones had knowingly endangered her pregnancy. The larger background to the case is unclear. The Journal of Health Politics, Policy, and Law reported in 2013 that there have been \\"at least 413 people were arrested, detained, or forced to undergo medical interventions they didn't want, in the name of protecting the health of their fetuses\\".  Judicial history  Marshae Jones and Ebony Jamison engaged in a fight outside of a Dollar General Store in Pleasant Grove on December 4, 2018, when Jones was five months pregnant. Reportedly, the fight was about the man by whom Jones was pregnant. Having been shot in the abdomen, Jones was taken to a hospital, where the fetus was declared nonviable before police officers arrived. Six months later, Jones was taken into police custody on June 26, 2019, after being indicted in Jefferson County on a manslaughter charge for the death of her fetus that occurred because of a December 2018 fight that resulted in Jones being shot by Ebony Jemison. This indictment was made after police argued to a grand jury that Jones deserved to be blamed for the shooting and for not removing herself from the situation. They alleged that Jones had initiated and pressed the fight and that the fetus was the real victim, having no choice about being in the fight and relying on Jones for protection. The indictment stated that Jones \\"intentionally\\" caused the death of \\"Unborn Baby Jones by initiating a fight knowing she was five months pregnant\\", however, the office of District Attorney Lynneice O. Washington released a statement that it had not yet decided on whether to pursue the case, as the district attorney was out of the country at the time. On July 1, 2019, it was reported that Jones' lawyers , J. Mark White, Augusta S. Dowd, Linda G. Flippo, Hope S. Marshall, and Curtis H. Seal, had filed for a motion to dismiss, on grounds that Alabama's legal statute for manslaughter contains language that forbids the prosecution of a woman in regards to her pregnancy. On July 3, 2019 it was announced by the office of Alabama District Attorney that they would not prosecute the case. Jefferson County District Attorney Washington released a statement that stated she felt it was \\"not in the best interest of justice to pursue prosecution of Ms. Jones\\" and that she was \\"dismissing this case and no further legal action will be taken against Ms. Jones in this matter.\\"  Response to the case  Alabama Reproductive Rights Advocates released a statement that it was working with Jones to get her released on bail and to find her legal representation. The president of the National Organization for Women and the executive director of the National Advocates for Pregnant Women, voiced their support for Jones and brought up arguments about the rights of pregnant women, and Alabama's abortion laws.

The act specified that the board should consist of a chairman and two other members. Its remit was to consider complaints under the Act. It dealt with 327 complaints of racial discrimination in 1966. The board was abolished by the Race Relations Act 1976, and its role was amalgamated with that of the Community Relations Commission to form the Commission for Racial Equality. The first chair of the board was Mark Bonham Carter. He visited the United States and Canada in November 1966 to draw lessons from the experiences of North America in handling racial discrimination. He stated that he viewed the existence of a significant African-American minority in itself as a \\"permanent historical problem\\" and opined that problems in the United Kingdom were \\"new\\". Geoffrey Bindman, QC was the legal advisor to the board throughout its existence and subsequently with the Commission for Racial Equality. The Board set up and co-ordinated 7 regional conciliation committees whose role was to deal with complaints of discrimination. These committees set out reach a settlement of the difference between the complainant and the discriminator with an assurance from the latter that the problem would not arise again. However if no settlement was obtained, the matter would then be referred to the RRB and, if necessary, to the Attorney-General. There was no criminal sanction. Four cases were referred to the Attorney-General in the period up to 1968.

The trunk is straight and cylindrical, up to in diameter, and without branches for more than half its height. The flowers are white and fragrant, and the fruits are large pods, the seeds weighing about . Distribution This tree is a constituent of tropical rainforest in Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola. Ecology In the Ituri Rainforest, in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the dominant trees are J. seretii and Gilbertiodendron dewevrei, while in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, J. seretii and Cynometra alexandri are the most abundant. The seeds of this tree fall to the ground and dispersal is limited to a distance of up to from the edge of the crown. G. dewevrei has larger seeds () with more limited dispersal ability. In general, in forests where they are both present, J. seretii has the more numerous, faster growing seedlings but G. dewevrei the greatest presence in the canopy. The seedlings of both species can tolerate low light conditions, but among the saplings or taller, growth ceases in a higher proportion of J. seretii and mortality rates are considerably higher. This species also has a significantly lower lifespan than G. dewevrei. Uses The timber of Julbernardia seretii, known as \\"Congo zebrawood\\" in the export trade, is dark brown and used in joinery, furniture, cabinet work and as a veneer. It also has uses in construction, boat building, flooring, carving and turnery, as well as being used for making ladders, toys, agricultural implements, tool handles and other items.

Background  Goodes, an Aboriginal Australian, was drafted by the Sydney Swans in the 1997 AFL Draft and went on to have a successful career with the Swans, featuring in their 2005 and 2012 premiership teams and being awarded a number of accolades for his performances including the AFL Rising Star award in 1999, the Brownlow Medal (2003 and 2006), the Bob Skilton Medal (2003, 2006 and 2011), and All Australian selection (2003, 2006, 2009 and 2011). In 2014 he was named Australian of the Year in recognition of his community work supporting Indigenous Australian youth, the efforts of the Go Foundation (co-founded with his Sydney Swans teammate Michael O'Loughlin), and his efforts to combat racism. On 24 May 2013, during the AFL's annual Indigenous Round (the Sir Doug Nicholls Round), a 13-year-old Collingwood supporter called Goodes an \\"ape\\". Upon hearing the abuse, Goodes pointed the girl out to security, who ejected her from the stadium.\\"Ejected teenage fan didn't know 'ape' was racist\\". Sydney Morning Herald. Goodes was deeply affected by the incident, but said repeatedly that the girl should not be blamed; the environment that she grew up in had shaped her response. The girl phoned to apologise, saying that she hadn't realised the impact of her words. Over the following years, and particularly in 2015, Goodes was repeatedly and loudly booed by opposition fans at most matches. The motivation for, and acceptability of, the booing generated wide public debate, which dominated media coverage from both sports and political commentators for weeks at a time. During a match against in May 2015, again during the Indigenous Round, Goodes celebrated a goal by performing an Aboriginal war dance, in which he mimed throwing a spear in the direction of the Carlton cheer squad. Goodes said after the incident that the dance was based on one he learned from under-16s Indigenous team the Flying Boomerangs, and that it was intended as an expression of Indigenous pride during Indigenous Round, not as a means of offending or intimidating the crowd. The booing of Goodes intensified in the months after the war dance. Goodes took indefinite leave from the game in August of the 2015 season. Many clubs and players in the AFL supported Goodes in the week of his leave. He returned the following week and played for the remainder of the season after an outpouring of support from fans, actors, politicians, celebrities and teammates, including two spontaneous standing ovations. Goodes retired from the AFL in September 2015. He did not attend the Grand Final, where retiring players traditionally take part in a parade, one of only a handful of players to decline this invitation since the parade for retiring players was established.  Documentary  The documentary uses only archival footage and newspaper headlines from the last few years of Goodes' career, with no new interviews or footage. It includes footage of the incidents, as well as interviews and comments from media personalities, politicians, players, officials, and members of the public. Goodes himself was not interviewed for the documentary, although he was consulted and gave permission for it to go ahead. Many commentators and Goodes himself believed that the booing was racially motivated, while others believed that it was motivated by dislike of his playing style or of his response to a 13 year old girl who shouted a racially-charged insult at him. The director's statement about the film states that he did not want to explicitly choose a side but instead wanted to present the footage and allow \\"the audience to see and hear for themselves what had happened, to ask their own questions and to come to their own conclusions\\".  Release  The Final Quarter was shown to the 2019 playing group of Indigenous players in a preview screening in February 2019. It had its World Premiere at the 2019 Sydney Film Festival. It was shown as part of the 2019 Perth International Film Festival and the Castlemaine Documentary Film Festival, both in July 2019, and aired on Network Ten on 18 July 2019. Darling also announced that the film will be made freely available to schools and clubs across Australia.  Reception  The documentary was widely praised by critics. Luke Buckmaster, writing for The Guardian, called it \\"confronting\\" and \\"inspiring\\", while Blake Howard, writing for Flicks, gave it five stars and called it exhilarating and powerful. Garry Maddox, for the Sydney Morning Herald says \\"It is a powerful work that stirs deep emotions\\", while Screenhub's Sarah Ward calls it 'crucial'. The Go Foundation reported that it had received several messages from members of the public who had seen the documentary and wanted to express their remorse for having booed Goodes. Paul Kelly wrote the end credit song \\"Every Day My Mother's Voice\\" for the film, and won Best Original Song Composed for the Screen, 2019 Screen Music Awards.

They said: > Adam, who represents so much that is good and unique about our game, was > subject to treatment that drove him from football. The game did not do > enough to stand with him, and call it out. Failure to call out racism and > not standing up for one of our own let down all Aboriginal and Torres Strait > Islander players, past and present. Our game is about belonging. We want all > Australians to feel they belong and that they have a stake in the game. We > will not achieve this while racism and discrimination exists in our game... > We will stand strongly with all in the football community who experience > racism or discrimination. We are unified on this, and never want to see the > mistakes of the past repeated. The statement also said that the football community \\"pledged to continue to fight all forms of racism and discrimination, on and off the field\\". = Responses by AFL clubs and players = The Western Bulldogs released their own statement about the documentary. The Hawthorn players all wore number 37, Goodes' jersey number, during their warm ups before their match against Sydney on 21 June 2019 in a gesture of support.

The original idea behind the film came from Chicago-based Executive Producers Masha Sajdeh and Rohan Sajdeh, which was then developed into a story and screenplay by Agnello Dias. Two Hollywood writers, Matt Graham and Zak Shaikh were also brought in during development to work on the screenplay. The film is produced by Masha Sajdeh, Steven Cantor and Jamie Schutz. Doosra is the story of how cricket changed India, seen through the eyes of a young girl. The film is a groundbreaking feature format a fictional narrative weaving with archival footage well-documented incidents from India's political, economic and sporting history at the turn of the millennium. Doosra is slang for ‘the other one.’ In cricketing terminology, a ball that unexpectedly goes the other way. In the film, Doosra represents a country that overcome centuries old inferiority complex to find its confidence through cricket. And also, a girl who refuses to be defined by what centuries of social tradition expect a girl to be.  Cast  * Plabita Borthakur * Ankur Vikal * Samidha Guru * Tvisha Seema * Krishna Gokani * Rajeev Ankit * Mohammad iliyas * Kusum Gupta * Renu Seth * Akshay Ajit Singh Plot Set between the last decade of the previous millennium and the turn of this one, the film weaves together two stories of courage and identity. One, played out under the harsh glare of the national spotlight by a maverick captain, Sourav Ganguly, and his defiant team. The other, deeply private, in an orthodox household in small town India, where an equally defiant young girl, Tara, takes on social prejudices as she comes to terms with her own mind and body. Both stories have their principal characters fighting the demons of tradition, classism and orthodoxy. What brings the two narratives to a head is a single event: When Captain Sourav Ganguly pulls off his shirt and waves it bare-chested from the hallowed altar of cricket - the balcony at Lords in London - to celebrate India’s 2002 NatWest final victory against their erstwhile colonial rulers. A defiant celebratory act is suddenly elevated to an iconic image for a nation that finally sheds its centuries of inferiority complex to stand proud and comfortable in its own bare skin.  Music  The music of the film is composed by Ram Sampath. Marketing and release On 27 June 2019, makers of the movie revealed the first poster of the film in social media introducing \\"Doosra: India’s Other Freedom Struggle\\". The official trailer of the film was released on 28 June. Both the poster and trailer showcased the iconic moment from the 2002 NatWest Final when Sourav took off his shirt and waved it from the balcony at Lord’s turning a victory celebration into a national awakening. The trailer featured prominent authors, journalists and cricket commentators like Harsha Bhogle, Shashi Tharoor, Rajdeep Sardesai, Ayaz Memon, Boria Majumdar and Nasser Hussain, all talking about the significance of that moment for India.

Encompassing mountains, forest-steppe, shoreline and marine areas, Karadag is an area of high biodiversity and the subject of much scientific study throughout the past 100 years. It supports a high number of Crimea's endemic species, and important bird colonies. The reserve is 36 km southwest of the city of Feodosia, and is currently administered by the Russian Academy of Sciences. Topography The Karadag Reserve is located in on the southeast coast of the Crimean Peninsula, in the Black Sea, on the eastern tip of the Crimean Mountains. The site is built on the Kara Dag Mountain, a volcanic massif that formed in the Jurassic. The southern shores of the mountains slope down to the sea, creating an 8 km shoreline of bays, beaches, and grottoes. 809 hectares of the site covers off-shore marine areas. The marine sector plus the pebble- boulder beach and the coastal cliffs up to 120 meters, are a RAMSAR Wetland of International Importance. The reserve is bracketed by the coastal towns of Koktebel on the north, and Kurortne to the south. Map posted in the reserve Climate and ecoregion The climate of Karadag is Humid continental climate - Hot summer sub-type (Köppen climate classification Dfa), with large seasonal temperature differentials and a hot summer (at least one month averaging over , and mild winters.. The average temperature in the reserve in February is , and in July. The water temperature varies from to . Annual sunshine averages 2,200-2,300 hours per year, and annual precipitation averages 300 mm. The reserve is in the western extreme of the Crimean Submediterranean forest complex ecoregion, a small band of territory that stretches from the southern Crimean peninsula to the northern Caucasus Mountains. Flora and fauna Because of its variety of habitat and position on both mountain and coast, the area is one of great biodiversity. Over half of the plant and animal species of Crimea are found in the Karadag Reserve, and one third of Crimea's endemic species. 40% of the reserve is forested, mostly with hornbeam, ash, pine and oak. Eight different types of feather-grass steppe make up most of the rest. Scientists have recorded 1,154 species of vascular plants, 115 species of fish, 35 of mammals, and 236 species of birds. The area is particularly important for fish-eating birds, including a significant colony of European shag (a type of cormorant) on the cliffs. Public use As a strict nature reserve, Kara-Dag's primary purpose is protection of nature and scientific study. Public access is limited: mass recreation and construction of facilities is prohibited as are hunting and fishing. There is an ecological trail (hiking) through the mountainous part of the reserve, recording over 15,000 users per year.. In the nearby village of Kurortne the reserve administers an ecological visitors center with wildlife and plant exhibits, and a 'Dolphinarium' (aquarium and center for dolphin study). Reserve scientists and staff sponsor educational programs and publications. .

Its use started even before the creation of Bangladesh, during the United Pakistan period. The inclusive slogan gained support from not only a vast number of Bengali Muslims but also minority populations such as the Hindus and non- Bengali tribal peoples. Etymology The slogan is a use of the standard Bengali suffix of Persian origin; Zindabad (Long Live), that is placed after a person or a country name. It is used to express victory or patriotism. History It is said to have originated during a speech by Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani on 23 November 1970 in Paltan Maidan, Dhaka. The speech happened only a few days after the 1970 Bhola cyclone, the deadliest natural disaster to ever be recorded in history. The Government of Pakistan was heavily criticised for its slow reactions in relief operations following the storm by Bhashani and he recommended that East Pakistan should separate and become its own independent country. He ended the speech by replacing the Pakistani slogan of Pakistan Zindabad with \\"Purbo Pakistan Zindabad\\" (Long Live East Pakistan). Throughout the Bangladesh Liberation War, Bangladesh Zindabad and Sheikh Mujib Zindabad was a common phrase used by supporters of the Bengali separatist movement in Pakistan. Following Bangladeshi independence, many were of the opinion that Joy Bangla (Victory to Bengal) had completed its motive and that Bangladesh Zindabad, hoping for longevity, would be more of an appropriate slogan. During the presidency of Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad in 1975, Bangladesh Zindabad was made the national slogan of Bangladesh, replacing Joy Bangla. The slogan was also used during the presidency of Ziaur Rahman as part of his attempt to create a territorial identity for Bangladesh in contrast to the ethnolinguistic Bengali identity. It was used in particular, as a closing remark for his speeches. Rahman promoted ideas of Bangladeshi nationalism rather than Bengali nationalism which gained support from not only a vast percentage of the Bengali population but also the ethnic minorities in the country who were not of Bengali origin such as the Biharis and indigenous peoples in Bangladesh. After the 7 November 1975 coup d'état, Bangladeshi citizens from \\"all strata of society\\" were known to have shouted \\"Bangladesh Zindabad\\".

They were bought by the Government of South Australia in 2017 as a response to the 2016 South Australian blackout and load-shedding in February 2017. Temporary Generation North is five open cycle gas turbines installed at the former Holden site in Elizabeth South, a northern suburb of Adelaide. The generators were purchased to be used only in emergency shortfalls in electricity supply to the grid, such as in extreme weather. Both sets were first used on 24 January 2019 to deal with a supply shortfall in Victoria. The intent of the Weatherill ALP state government was that the turbines would be converted from diesel fuel to natural gas and moved to a single location while remaining owned by the government. In August 2019, the state government (following the 2018 election, now controlled by the Liberal party) announced that it had arranged 25-year leases of the power stations to two different companies, with the leases taking effect from May 2020. Both companies operate wind farms in South Australia. The five northern generators will be leased to Nexif Energy and relocated to a new site at Outer Harbor and operating on natural gas before the end of 2020. Nexif Energy also proposes to convert them to combined cycle with a steam turbine in the following few years.

SETI Institute has partnered with Unistellar and will be able to send requests for information and notifications to the eVscope users, and receive information about transient astronomical events. The company experienced difficulties bringing the product to market. The consumer-grade electronic telescope was originally planned to be available in the \\"fall 2018\\" which subsequently shifted to \\"early 2019,\\" then later in 2019. General availability of the scope had not been achieved by January 2020, and the company then projected availability sometime in May–August of 2020. As of May 2020, 1000 telescopes had been delivered to customers  History  The company was founded in Marseille, France, in 2015, with incubator investment from Incubateur Impulse and Pépinières d'Entreprises Innovantes with subsequent VC round capital from private investors and a VC firm named Brighteye Ventures.

The telescope is a -diameter Prime focus reflector and images onto a CMOS color sensor with 1.3 million pixels. The image is transmitted to a small screen in an eyepiece also mounted on the telescope. An electronic connection to a computer (smartphone, pad, or laptop) is required to make astronomical observations from the telescope. The digital technology allows multiple images to be stacked while subtracting the noise component of the observation producing images of Messier objects and faint stars as dim as an apparent magnitude of 15 with consumer- grade equipment. By January 2020, the telescope was expected to be shipped worldwide between May and August 2020.

According to Mina Andreeva, the spokeswoman of the European Commission, more solidarity is needed along with \\"foreseeable and sustainable solutions for the landing and re-localization in the Mediterranean\\"; she quoted the commissioner in charge of migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos. Two weeks after the rescue, the 49 migrants were still blocked off Malta on Sea-Watch 3 and the ', in spite of an appeal by Pope Francis. On 9 January, they were finally allowed to disembark in Malta after an agreement to relocate them to eight other European countries was reached. On 19 January, Sea-Watch 3 rescued 47 further migrants. The Italian government forbade her from entering the port, and initiated legal action against the Netherlands; the organisation referred the case to the European Court of Human Rights. On 29 January, Italy, Germany, France, Malta, Portugal, Romania, and Luxembourg agreed to relocate the 47 migrants. Deputy Prime Minister of Italy Matteo Salvini demanded that Sea-Watch 3 be detained. As the ship was docked at the Italian city Catania to land the migrants, she was blocked by the Italian military on the grounds of \\"several non-conformities\\"; the organisation called the obstruction political pressure. On 19 May 2019, the Italian police seized Sea-Watch 3 at the island Lampedusa, allowing the disembarking of the 47 migrants whom she had recently picked up on 15 May 2019. Reports of the operations angered Matteo Salvini, who opposed the landing of the migrants. In June 2019, the ship was again detained; 53 migrants had been rescued from the coast of Libya on 12 June. Italy allowed only 11 especially vulnerable people to disembark; on 25 June 2019, the captain of Sea-Watch 3 threatened to land at Lampedusa in spite of the interdiction, eventually entering Italian territorial waters. According to the organisation, it was \\"not as a provocative act, but out of necessity and responsibility\\". A column in French newspaper Le Monde stated that Captain Carola Rackete was only \\"reminding us all of the existence of international conventions such as that stating rescue at sea is a duty for all\\".

She was awarded the 2016 European Geosciences Union Sergey Soloviev Medal.  Early life and education  Alcántara-Ayala was born in Mexico City. She studied geography at National Autonomous University of Mexico and earned her bachelor's degree in 1993. Based on her performance during her undergraduate studies, she was awarded the Gabino Barreda medal. She was a graduate student at King's College London, where she worked on geomorphology and was awarded a PhD in 1997.  Research and career  In 1998 Alcántara-Ayala joined Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a postdoctoral research fellow, where she worked in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. In 2000 Alcántara-Ayala joined National Autonomous University of Mexico as an Assistant Professor. She was promoted to Professor and the youngest woman to be made Director of the Institute of Geography in 2008. Her work focuses on Latin America and the Caribbean. She works with the Mexico National Centre for Disasters Prevention and the Natural Hazards Centre. Alcántara-Ayala is a member of the Network of Social Studies on the Prevention of Disasters in Latin America. She has assessed the hazard presented by rainfall-induced landslides, using aerial photographs, field observations and slope instability analysis. She combines this field work with social science studies, including social vulnerability analysis. She has emphasised the need for geomorphologists to be involved with the assessment of risk and management of disasters in the developing world. In general, Alcántara-Ayala believes that disasters are socially constructed, that there is a nexus between risk, the environment and development and that risks can be managed at a local level. She collaborates with other colleagues in the Forensic Investigations of Disaster project, which investigates the causes and drivers of risk creation. Alcántara-Ayala has also proposed transforming the National Civil Protection System in Mexico into a more oriented policy of Integrated Disaster Risk Management. = Academic service = Alcántara-Ayala is former Vice President of the International Association of Geomorphologists. She has previously served as Vice President of the International Geographical Union and of the Integrated Research on Disaster Risk Programme (ISC). She serves on the leadership council of the Mountain Research Initiative (MRI).

Alternatively, simulation of such a network will also produce a solution to the minimum s–t cut problem. This article gives basic definitions, a statement of the theorem and a proof of the theorem. The presentation in this article closely follows the presentation of the theorem in the original publication. Definitions  Definitions in this article are consistent in all respects with those given in a discussion of the maximum-flow minimum-cut theorem. = Flow graph = Cederbaum's theorem applies to a particular type of directed graph: . V is the set of nodes. E is the a set of directed edges: E = (a, b) \\\\in V \\\\times V . A positive weight is associated with each edge: . Two of the nodes must be s and t: s \\\\in V and t \\\\in V . = Flow = Flow, , is a positive quantity associated with each edge in the graph. Flow is constrained by the weight of the associated edge and by the conservation of flow at each vertex as described here. = Current = Edge pair. Current is defined as a map for each edge pair to the real numbers, . Current maps from the voltage to a range that is determined by the weights of the respective forward and reverse edges. Each edge pair is the tuple consisting of the forward and reverse edges for a given pair of vertices. The current in the forward and reverse directions between a pair of nodes are the additive inverses of one another: . Current is conserved at each interior node in the network. The net current at the s and t nodes is non-zero. The net current at the s node is defined as the input current. For the set of neighbors of the node s, N_s: : I_{in} = \\\\sum_{b \\\\in N_s}i_{sb} = Voltage = Voltage is defined as a mapping from the set of edge pairs to real numbers, . Voltage is directly analogous to electrical voltage in an electrical network. The voltage in the forward and reverse directions between a pair of nodes are the additive inverses of one another: . The input voltage is the sum of the voltages over a set of edges, P_{ab}, that form a path between the s and t nodes. : V_{in} = \\\\sum_{(a,b) \\\\in P_{ab}}v_{ab} = s–t cut = Minimum s–t cut for directed graph. All edges have equal weights. An s–t cut is a partition of the graph into two parts each containing one of either s or t. Where S \\\\cup T = V , \\\\;\\\\; s \\\\in S , \\\\;\\\\; t \\\\in T , the s–t cut is (S, T) . The s–t cut set is the set of edges that start in S and end in T . The minimum s–t cut is the s–t cut whose cut set has the minimum weight. Formally, the cut set is defined as: : X_C = \\\\\\\\{ (a, b) \\\\in E \\\\mid a \\\\in S, b \\\\in T \\\\\\\\} = Electrical network = An electrical network is a model that is derived from a flow graph. Each resistive element in the electrical network corresponds to an edge pair in the flow graph. The positive and negative terminals of the electrical network are the nodes corresponding to the s and t terminals of the graph, respectively. The voltage state of the model becomes binary in the limit as the input voltage difference approaches \\\\infty. The behavior of the electrical network is defined by Kirchhoff's voltage and current laws. Voltages add to zero around all closed loops and currents add to zero at all nodes. = Resistive element = A resistive element in the context of this theorem is a component of the electrical network that corresponds to an edge pair in the flow graph. = iv characteristic = iv characteristic. The iv characteristic is the relationship between current and voltage. The requirements are: (i) Current and voltage are continuous function with respect to one another. (ii) Current and voltage are non-decreasing functions with respect to one another. (iii) The range of the current is limited by the weights of the forward and reverse edges corresponding to the resistive element. The current range may be inclusive or exclusive of the endpoints. The domain of the voltage is exclusive of the maximum and minimum currents: : : Statement of theorem The limit of the current between the input terminals of the electrical network as the input voltage, approaches \\\\infty, is equal to the weight of the minimum cut set . : \\\\lim_{V_{in} \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} (I_{in})= \\\\min_{X_C}\\\\sum_{(a,b) \\\\in X_C}w_{ab} .  Proof  Claim 1 Current at any resistive element in the electrical network in either direction is always less than or equal to the maximum flow at the corresponding edge in the graph. Therefore, the maximum current through the electrical network is less than the weight of the minimum cut of the flow graph: : \\\\lim_{V_{in} \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} (I_{in}) \\\\leq \\\\min_{X_C}\\\\sum_{(a,b) \\\\in X_C}w_{ab} . Claim 2 As the input voltage V_{in} approaches infinity, there exists at least one cut set X'_C such that the voltage across the cut set approaches infinity. : \\\\exists X'_C \\\\;\\\\; \\\\forall \\\\; (a,b) \\\\in X'_C \\\\;\\\\; \\\\lim_{V_{in} \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}(v_{ab}) = \\\\infty This implies that: : \\\\lim_{V_{in} \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} (I_{in}) = \\\\sum_{(a,b) \\\\in X'_C}w_{ab} \\\\; \\\\geq \\\\; \\\\min_{X_C}\\\\sum_{(a,b) \\\\in X_C}w_{ab}. Given claims 1 and 2 above: : \\\\lim_{V_{in} \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} (I_{in}) = \\\\min_{X_C}\\\\sum_{(a,b) \\\\in X_C}w_{ab} .

The authors became known internationally as \\"The Three Marias\\", which became the title of the book in its first translation to English. The book's publication and banning, its subsequent stage adaptations, and the international outcry over the arrest of the authors, revealed to the world the existence of extremely discriminatory dictatorial repression and the power of the Catholic patriarchy in Portugal. New Portuguese Letters also denounced the injustices of Portuguese colonialism, and played a part in the downfall of the Second Republic and the authoritarian regimes which had ruled Portugal since 1926.  Summary  New Portuguese Letters (NPL) was conceived in 1971, three years before the Carnation Revolution and the consequent independence of the Portuguese colonies in Africa. Its authors, Maria Isabel Barreno, Maria Teresa Horta and Maria Velho da Costa, were already established writers.BESSE, Maria Graciete. «As Novas Cartas Portuguesas e a Contestação do Poder Patriarcal» in Latitudes, n.º 26, April 2006: 16-20. (In Portuguese) They began to meet twice weekly in Lisbon, publicly for lunch and privately for dinner, in order to \\"examine the problems they shared as women and as liberal writers.\\" A volume of poetry by Horta had recently been banned, and they intended their new work as a direct challenge to the censors, and also, one critic has written, as \\"an incitement to insurrection, based on the conviction that \\"when woman rebels against man, nothing remains unchanged\\" ([NPL p.] 158).\\" The three authors exchanged writings, drawing inspiration from the seventeenth century classic Letters of a Portuguese Nun. That work comprises five letters allegedly written by a Portuguese nun named Sister Mariana Alcoforado who lived in the Convent of the Conception in Beja, Portugal, after she was seduced and abandoned by her lover, a French knight, who was fighting in the Portuguese Restoration War against Spain. New Portuguese Letters combines letters, essays, poems, fragments, puzzles and excerpts from legal documents in unpredictable order. The three Marias write to and as the Marianas, Marias and Anas whom they have invented as the original Sister Mariana's female descendants, \\"vítimas da opressão patriarcal, da violência social, da injustiça e da discriminação\\" (victims of patriarchal oppression, social violence, injustice and discrimination). In some of the letters they write as men, husbands, lovers, fathers, etc: \\"the letters they invent come from men fighting in colonial wars in Europe, Angola, or Africa, addressing the women they leave behind ... husbands absent for twelve years write letters home, blithely describing new mistresses, new families they have engendered, while their Portuguese wives remain faithful, dressed in widow's weeds.\\" They also write to and about each other: \\"Each Maria thus serves as analyst as well as reader-critic for the other two ... They purposely shift roles from analyst to analysand repeatedly ... their own image for the process is an open parabola ... suggest[ing] the dynamic relationship between three shifting entities, three bodies that want to remain open to experimentation, to suggestion, to analysis, to each other. ... Each Maria, moreover, is a critic as well as a reader of the theories of the other two. They disagree about the uses and value of the women's movement; about the causes, consequences, and remedies for patriarchy; about the solutions to women's misery in the modern world.\\"  Authorship  The three writers signed the work together and never revealed which one composed each fragment, as \\"a symbol of their sisterhood and the common sufferings of women\\". Some academic studies attempted to determine the authorship of the various texts that compose the book by comparison with their individually authored literary works. Others respected their decision and rationale: \\"They call their process of writing, their final product, and their relationship a trialectic in order to disrupt all dichotomies, all binary oppositions that .. are so often exploited to define and circumscribe woman, desire, discourse.\\"  Political reception  The book was immediately successful in Portugal after its publication in 1972, and acclaimed as a masterpiece, but was quickly banned by censors, described as \\"pornographic and an offense to public morals\\", and the three authors were arrested and imprisoned, charged with \\"abuse of the freedom of the press\\" and \\"outrage to public decency\\". The authors smuggled their book to France, sending it to the editors of three French feminists whose work they admired, and thus it reached the French women’s liberation movement. The book and the arrests became internationally famous. A campaign of protests against the detention of the three Marias was discussed at the first International Feminist Planning Conference, sponsored by the National Organization for Women, held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in June 1973. Protests were held on the date the trial of the three Marias was scheduled to begin, July 3, 1973, in the US, France, Italy, England, Belgium, Finland and Japan, as well as in Portugal and Brazil. The proceedings were suspended several times, and further protests were held at the time of hearings in October 1973 and in January and February 1974. Following the coup of April 25, 1974 which ended the dictatorship of Marcelo Caetano, the trial was terminated and the authors pardoned, with the judge declaring the book \\"of outstanding literary merit\\". Soon after their acquittal, Maria Velho da Costa publicly dissociated herself from feminism and women’s liberation groups. She joined the Portuguese Communist Party. Both Maria Isabel Barreno and Maria Teresa Horta were members of the Portuguese women's liberation movement, although by mid 1975 Horta had resigned due to frustration with low numbers and lack of engagement with working-class women.  Literary reception  As a literary work, New Portuguese Letters is not easily classifiable. If it is not a novel or essay, it is not just a feminist manifesto. As the scholar Darlene Sadlier points out, the three Marias themselves refer to their book as \\"something unclassifiable\\", which suggests not so much the difficulty as rather the reluctance of the authors to categorize the book, thus rejecting the logic of traditional literary forms.Sadlier, Darlene. The Question of How: Women Writers and New Portuguese Literature. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 1989, p. 7. Critics have attempted to describe it, one saying it was \\"a huge and complicated garland—or perhaps wreath—of poetry and prose\\", another seeing roots in Portuguese literary tradition, particularly the work of Bernardim Ribeiro: \\"Like [Ribeiro's] Menina e moça, the New Letters also contain a series of concentric \\"sentimental\\" stories of love and sorrow.\\" A 2006 Portuguese study describes it as \\"um palimpsesto, na medida em que a sua superfície esconde níveis de significação mais profundos\\" (a palimpsest, in which its surface hides deeper levels of signification); others have called it \\"a post-modern collage of fiction, personal letters, poetry, and erotica\\". While the trial of the three Marias was widely reported in English-language media, the first English translation, by Helen R Lane, was not published until 1975. Evaluations of its literary merits were mixed. Some reviewers found that it \\"labours under cliché\\", and was \\"experimental in the worst sense, a rearrangement of clichés which lead nowhere.\\" Another reviewer wrote, \\"Hectic, confined, plangent, these letters convey an intolerable tension ... The real meat of the book is in the documentation, in the glimpses of Lisbon rooms, Lisbon streets, in the reported lives of housemaids, schoolgirls, soldiers, grannies, in the flat and appalling statements quoted from the Portuguese Penal Code. In these areas the writing triumphs, conveying the flavour of a way of life we need to understand.\\" Reviewers were also divided in their estimation of the descriptions of love and sex. One reviewer said, \\"It is a tour-de-force of erotic expression and lyric outpourings\\"; another wrote, introducing two pieces republished from the book, that she found them \\"startling ... The selections demonstrate the arc throughout the volume, that of eroticism insisting upon its role in politics. The graphic description of a nun masturbating recalls Mariana's isolation, fervor, and fury at her trap\\". The New York Times reviewer found the book \\"tedious\\", saying \\"part of the trouble is that these three modern Marias are as obsessed with love as poor Soror Mariana. ... Whether they are taking the voice of Mariana of the convent, or any of the other Marianas, Marias and Maria Anas they have invented, or their own voices, they always manage to evoke the sense of some terrible wasting disease afflicting and at the same time thrilling them. Exiled Portuguese writer Hélder Macedo, reviewing the book in the Times Literary Supplement, commented on the fact that it has three authors: \\"each of the three writes to each of the others and [] all three together write collectively to others. One of the main interests of the book, as literature, resides precisely in this ever-shifting identity of the subject, ... constantly changing while the predicate remains essentially unchanged.\\"  Impact on feminism  The book has been considered a crucial landmark in the evolution of feminist thinking in Portuguese literature. Women began to talk about their bodies, about the pleasures and sufferings of their sexual relationship with men, and they shocked Portuguese society on account of that. Through all its elements, the book conveys a single message: women also have a voice, and know how to speak. A Portuguese feminist scholar, Ana Margarida Dias Martins, contends that \\"one of the grim consequences of this book’s astounding international success was that, although it remained important in the political context of international feminist solidarity, it failed to enter the feminist canon of theory texts in Europe and the US.\\" She points out that \\"[d]uring the wave of international solidarity, only fragments of the book circulated in translation\\", and quotes radical feminist Robin Morgan as writing, “When the book was published in the United States, the English translation seemed to me somewhat less inspiring than the selections .. done by Gilda Grillo and Louise Bernikow [for a live performance in 1974].\\" Some reviewers of the first English translation did consider its contribution to feminist theory. Jane Kramer wrote, \\"As a feminist book, though, “The Three Marias” is in trouble ... while it is true that the exercise of passion was their agreed‐on exercise, their collective lamentations on passion never really penetrate love's tyrannies or its embittering social and familiar uses as much as they detail some morbid and inescapable pathology. In their portraits of imagined sisters through the centuries, the convent of Soror Mariana becomes a metaphor for the bedroom, and the bedroom for the world to which women are confined—which is appropriate, since their women rarely seem to leave their bedrooms except to go mad or kill themselves. But the impression one gets from this is that the women of Portugal are all in a state of torpid but advanced sexual hysteria, or a state of sexual repression\\". Juliet Mitchell, author of Psychoanalysis and Feminism, wrote: \\"Feminism, the relationship of literature to society and the importance of revolution weave their way through the intellectual discussions within the book ... The nun is an image of the Portuguese woman who is not only the victim of an oppressive, authoritarian and male-dominated society but one who even in the act of breaking free (a nun with a lover) cannot transcend her general female identity as eternal victim. Even in the exuberance of her passion the 17th century nun, as the three Marias conceive her, is near to whining and total self-centredness. .... A lot of ideas, a lot of issues, are raised by the book. But ultimately I find it irritating ... The different strands counteract rather than complete each other, so that just as one is wanting to agree or disagree with some point of analysis (I personally disagree quite a lot) one is called to a halt by a bit of poetry. And the poetry is not good enough to stand on its own merits.\\" Linda S. Kauffman, a feminist literary theory scholar, challenges these perceptions, saying \\"The writing is a process of searching for the law of their own desires. They inscribe those desires in part by speaking to the nun rather than about her and by transforming her from victim into victor, famous in all the courts of Europe for her celebrated letters .... the nun, after all, does not destroy herself; instead, she writes.\\"  Adaptations  New Portuguese Letters (or excerpts from it) had public readings on stage and radio, during the trial of its authors and after it was published in translation, in several countries including the US, UK and France. Several plays were based on it, including: *Parto (\\"Childbirth\\"), by Brazilian playwright Gilda Grillo and Maria Isabel Barreno (performed in New York and Paris in 1974 and 1975) *The Three Marias, by American poet Faith Gillespie, performed in London, England, and shown on Granada TV in 1975 *New Sonnets from the Portuguese, a dance-drama by Australian choreographer Margaret Barr, performed in Sydney, Australia, in 1975 *Maria, Anon by Susan Galbraith (performed in Minneapolis in 1981) *The Three Marias by Rui Braga and Georgian student Tamar Aznarashvili, performed in a psychiatric hospital, Centro Hospitalar Conde Ferreira, in Porto, Portugal, in 2016, and in Miragaia, Porto, in 2017.

Early life and education Duval was born in Rose Hill on 9 October 1930. He was born in an upper middle-class Creole family of mixed ancestry. His father Charles was a civil servant and his mother Rosida was a housewife. In 1933 when Gaëtan was only 3 years old his father died and thus his uncle Raoul raised him. The young Duval attended Saint-Enfant-Jésus RCA primary school and the Royal College of Curepipe. He then travelled abroad to study law at Lincoln's Inn (UK) and at the Faculty of Law of (Paris). He then joined the Mauritian Bar to practice as Barrister and became known during high profile cases. Political career After studying law in the UK and France he became actively involved in politics in Mauritius within Jules Koenig's party Ralliement Mauricien which became known as Parti Mauricien in 1963 and eventually as the \\"PMSD\\" in 1965. At the March 1959 General Elections the Ralliement Mauricien candidate Gaëtan Duval was defeated by Labour candidate Romricky Ramsamy in Constituency No. 29 Curepipe. But after contesting these results in Supreme Court on the basis that Ramsamy had included his nickname Narain in his registration Chief Judge Francis Herchenroder ruled in favour of Koenig's party and Ramsamy was disqualified. At the January 1960 by-elections Gaëtan Duval was elected to the Legislative Council after promoting ethnic hatred and racial division during his electoral campaign. This party advocated a continued association with the United Kingdom whilst the Independence Party (Mauritius) of Ramgoolam-Bissoondoyal-Mohamed demanded unconditional independence of the country. By 1965 Koenig retired from politics and Duval became the leader of the PMSD which was a conservative movement backed by wealthy white Franco-Mauritian oligarchs as well as most of the creole community of Roman Catholic faith. For a few years in the 1950s Duval's party even received the support of the Muslims but this ended when Abdool Razack Mohamed left the PMSD to form the new CAM in 1959. Minority Tamil groups continued to support the PMSD. Duval's electorate feared Hindu hegemony in an independent Mauritius and an intense violent hate campaign before and after the 1967 general elections led to the 1965 Mauritius race riots, 1967 Mauritius riots and 1968 Mauritian riots. Duval's and Mohamed's anti-Hindu slogans malbar nous pa oulé (a Creole term meaning \\"We don't want Hindus\\") or envelopé nous pa oulé (meaning \\"We don't want to be wrapped in saris or dhotis like Indians\\") were heavily criticised. However his popularity among the creole community led to him becoming known as Le Roi Creole (meaning King of the Creoles in creole language). Prior to the 1967 elections Gaëtan Duval's PMSD lodged a civil action in the Supreme Court of Mauritius to contest Rodriguans' inability to vote at general elections, especially given that the principle of universal suffrage was already in practice on mainland Mauritius since 1959. The Supreme Court ruled in Duval's favour. This enabled the inhabitants of Rodrigues to vote for the first time in August 1967. Following his defeat at the 1967 elections Duval became Leader of the Opposition. However his PMSD gradually split into rival factions, the main one being the Union Démocratique Mauricienne (UDM) formed by Guy Ollivry & Maurice Lesage within the Opposition in Parliament. By December 1969 Bissoondoyal's IFB left the PTr-IFB-CAM government to join the Opposition. Duval's reduced PMSD replaced the IFB within the ruling government in 1969 and several PMSD parliamentarians served as ministers within Ramgoolam's cabinet. However Gaetan Duval was dismissed as cabinet minister in 1973 and served as Leader of the Opposition again until 1976. In the 1976 general elections, PMSD won only 7 seats, and Gaetan Duval lost his seat and remained out of the legislative assembly until 1983. His party having won only 2 seats in the 1982 elections, he served from 1982 to 1983 for a last time as Leader of the Opposition. Although it was a significant political party in Mauritius in the 1970s Duval's PMSD lost much of its electorate in the 1980s to the radical leftist Mauritian Militant Movement party. Gaëtan duval nevertheless remained an enigmatic political personality even his party had less than 5 MPs for the period between 1982 and 1996. He made an electoral arrangement with then prime minister Jugnauth in the 1983 general elections and later joined the government, the alliance having been victorious. He became Minister of Tourism and later Deputy Prime Minister of Mauritius until 1988. He was lastly elected MP at the 1995 elections and remained as such until his death.http://electoral.govmu.org/English/electionresult/nasselec/Pages/Dec95/cons/17.aspxhttp://electoral.govmu.org/English/electionresult/nasselec/Pages/Dec95/Seats.aspx In the 1990s Gaetan's disagreement with his son Xavier-Luc Duval became public, especially regarding the leadership and symbol of the Parti Mauricien Social DémocratePMSD. His son, Xavier-Luc revealed to the population that he was ashamed of bearing the surname of Duval, due to the immoral lifestyle of his father. He nevertheless won his case in the Supreme Court. The factional struggles within PMSD caused a split into 3 parties. Gaëtan created his new party called Parti Gaëtan Duval whilst Xavier's faction formed a new party called Parti Mauricien Xavier Duval (PMXD). The original PMSD, though reduced, was led by Maurice Allet. Gaëtan aas not in good terms with his son at the time of his death. Many years after Gaëtan's death the PMSD was reunited in 2008 when Xavier and his party agreed to dissolve the PMXD and integrate back into the PMSD. Personal life Duval was the father of 2 sons, Xavier-Luc Duval (his biological child) and Richard Duval (whom he adopted at birth). Xavier-Luc trained as an accountant before becoming a politician and served as minister in various portfolios. Richard worked as a stable hand before starting his career in the Mauritian Parliament. Gaetan's grandson Adrien, who is Xavier's son, also served for one term in the National Assembly. Controversies In 1989 two ex-prisoners Paul Sarah and Moorgesh Shummoogum alleged in a statement to the police that in 1971 Sir Gaetan Duval had planned and commandeered the murder of Azor Adelaide at this Grand-Gaube bungalow. They made the police statement at the police station located outside then Prime Minister Sir Aneerood Jugnauth's residence at La Caverne, Vacoas. Paul Sarah, Moorgesh Shummoogum, Ignace Bahloo and André Celestin had already served prison sentences for their involvement in the 1971 murder. During the afternoon of 23 June 1989 Sir Gaetan Duval landed at Plaisance Airport in Mauritius from Madagascar and he was questioned by Superintendent of Police Reesaul of the Anti Drug and Smuggling Unit (ADSU). Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Cyril Morvan was also travelling on the same flight. Sir Gaëtan Duval was escorted to Line Barracks in Port Louis where he was arrested on murder charges. He was questioned in the presence of his lawyer Kader Bhayat before being detained at the barracks of Special Mobile Force in Vacoas. The arrest led to various protests by Gaetan Duval's supporters which sometimes turned violent. They protested against the dictatorial behaviour of then PM Sir Aneerood Jugnauth. However after a lengthy trial Sir Gaëtan Duval was acquitted of all murder charges. Recognition In recognition of his political and judicial career, the Legion of Honor was awarded to him by France in 1973. Later he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 1981 New Year Honours. In Mauritius, several facilities bear his name, including the hotel school of Ebène and the stadium of the municipality of Rose Hill. He is also the face of the Rs. 1,000 bank note and featured on a postage stamp issued by Mauritius Post. Several books have been written about Gaëtan Duval including 'Le droit à l’excès' and 'L’incarné du voyage' by Alain Gordon- Gentil. In 2015 the documentary \\"Gaëtan Duval, Une Vie\\" was released by La Compagnie Des Autres in Mauritius. Following Gaëtan Duval's death in 1996 his son Xavier has made it an annual tradition to host an open house at Gaëtan's bungalow located at Grand Gaube on the coast of Mauritius.

Personal life and early career  Bert Long, Jr., was born in 1940 in Fifth Ward, Houston, Texas. His mother worked as a maid, and his steelworker father died in a horrific workplace accident when Long was only three, leaving him to help out his mother as he could. His father, who worked at Sheffield Steel, died after falling into a vat of molten metal. Long helped provide care for his three younger siblings and as a child, picked cotton in the summer to help provide for the family. Long worked for the Houston Club when he was only twelve years old. He took his first art class at Wheatley High School (Houston) but was primarily self taught, spending many hours studying art books at the public library. In 1959, at the age of 19, Long joined the Marines and served until 1964. That same year, he married his childhood neighbor Connie Kelly. They had three children. Before his career as a visual artist, Long was an elite, nationally known chef. He attended culinary school in Los Angeles and first worked as an executive chef in a fine-dining chain before opening his own restaurant \\"Big Bert’s\\" in Oregon. Afterward, he returned to California to work as executive Sous-chef at the MGM Grand Las Vegas. The Longs moved to Rome after Long won the Rome Prize and later moved to Spain. Connie was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1997 and died in 1998 shortly after the couple moved back to Texas. Long visited Scottish-born artist Joan Batson in 1998, and in 1999, they returned to Houston where they shared a home until the time of Long's death. Long died from pancreatic cancer on February 1, 2013 at the age of 72. Just prior to his death, he married Batson, with whom he had shared a home and a life for over 15 years.  Career as a visual artist  Long's first exhibition was at the art gallery at the MGM Grand where he worked as an executive sous chef, and the experience inspired a major career change. It was 1975, and Long was in his mid thirties, when he decided to devote himself to a career as a visual artist. He packed up his family and traveled to art fairs across the western United States. In 1976, Long landed a job at the Ritz-Carlton in Chicago and enjoyed some artistic success in Chicago, including a showing at the DuSable Museum of African American History. His wife Connie Kelly Long stayed only one month before returning to Houston and its warmer climate. Long stayed on another 10 months before returning to Houston. In Houston, Long began to achieve recognition. He attracted the attention of Houston's art community including director of the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, Jim Harithas, and artists John Alexander, Salvatore Scarpitta and James Surls. Long believed that art could heal the dark side of humanities’ soul. He was a painter, photographer, and sculptor who worked with traditional materials but also with ice. Long showed at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston (CAMH) and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (MFAH) as well as museum and galleries across the United States and in Europe. Long was included in the important group show Fresh Paint at MFAH in 1985 and was awarded an National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1987. In 1990, he won the Prix de Rome, which included a one-year residency. In 2006, Surls curated Long's MFAH solo show Out of the life of Burt Long, Jr., which featured one of Long's best known painting's Ride the Tiger (2002), in which Long portrays himself riding a tiger naked except for oversized, heavy glasses. His large, public works include an approximately seven by thirty foot mural at the Looscan Neighborhood Library and a sculptural work called Field Of Visions that was installed on the Project Row Houses campus. The Looscan mural Art/Life (2008) references seventeen masterpieces, including those of Rembrandt and Da Vinci, and depicts a self portrait of Long steering a ship sailing towards the horizon over turbulent, shark-filled waters. The mural is acrylic on canvas and is framed in one of the custom, sculptural frames for which Long is known. According to Long, it represents various periods in art history, \\"the theme is the traversing of art and life\\" and sharks represent, \\"the trials and tribulations of artists.\\" The Bert Long, Jr. Papers are located at the University of Houston Special Collections, and Houston Museum of African American Culture (HMAAC) has a gallery dedicated in his name that displays the work of four Houston artists annually.

Education and career  Combs’s first musical memory was of listening to Beethoven’s Sixth Symphony as a toddler. He had his first musical training in church choir, and he played trombone as a child. But jazz was his main musical inspiration: after hearing James Moody on the radio, Combs felt he had to get a saxophone. Combs began playing professionally at age 17, doubling on flute and bass. Combs earned a Bachelor of Music degree in Composition from the Philadelphia Musical Academy, now the University of the Arts (Philadelphia) in 1968. He continued performing, and worked at WUHY-FM, now WHYY-FM, as broadcaster and producer of classical programming. He also produced concerts of folk music touring artists, later joining the folk touring circuit as singer/guitarist and backing up several folk singers and songwriters in concerts and on recordings, as guitarist and bassist. These singers included Utah Phillips, Paul Gerimia, Mary McCaslin, Jim Ringer, Paul Siebel and Rosalie Sorrels. In 1971, Combs moved to Boston, working as a broadcaster and programmer at WBUR-FM. While he was at WBUR, jazz programming was introduced at the station. Combs continued to perform locally in folk groups, but in 1974, feeling that he had gone as far as he could creatively with the folk idiom, returned to saxophone and concentrated on jazz. Combs also studied flute at this time with Sharon Zuckerman. In 1977, Combs wrote the score for the soundtrack of \\"David Swann: A Fantasy,\\" an adaptation of a Nathaniel Hawthorne story,. That same year, he attended the Creative Music Studio, where he studied with Karl Berger, Jimmy Giuffre, Lee Konitz, Anthony Braxton, Roscoe Mitchell, and Don Cherry. From 1983-1987, Combs co-directed SeaNote Productions with composer Joel Biddle. The company wrote scores and sound tracks, and among their clients were Digital Equipment Corp., Polaroid, the National Fire Prevention Association, Marshalls, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Combs then attended the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, graduating in 1995 with a Master of Music degree in performance. While there, he studied the Orff Schulwerk approach to music education, which integrates music, movement, drama and speech into lessons drawn from children’s natural play for collaborative music making. From 1986 to 1999 he worked full-time in music education, and assumed several leadership positions in Massachusetts and New England music education and jazz professional organizations. As a member of the Massachusetts Music Educators Association (MMEA), Combs helped to found the state chapter of the Society for General Music in Massachusetts. He also served as two-term Chair of SGMM, and was on the Conference Committee of the All State In-Service Conference of the MMEA: he was a frequent presenter of professional development sessions at that Conference, both for SGMMLetter 27 March 1994 SGMM to Paul Combs and for the state unit of the International Association of Jazz Educators (now the Massachusetts Association for Jazz Education, for which Combs served as Web/Newsletter Chair. He was Jazz Education Editor of the Mass. Music News and sat on the Board of the Massachusetts Association for Jazz Education. As President of the Seacoast Jazz Society, Combs created the Society’s lecture series. He later served as lecturer on New Hampshire Humanities Council’s Humanities To Go program.https://www.nhhumanities.org/humanitiestogo Combs relocated to San Diego, CA in 2015, where he performs regularly. Since 2016 he has served on the Governance and Professional Development Committees of the Arts Education Resource Organization (AERO) of San Diego.  Biographer of Tadd Dameron  Combs is best known for his biography of jazz composer and arranger Tadd Dameron, published in 2012. Entitled Dameronia: The Life and Music of Tadd Dameron (University of Michigan Press), it is considered the only fully researched, comprehensive biography of Dameron, who wrote many compositions that became part of the jazz repertoire and was a seminal influence in the evolution of jazz. The book explains the importance of Dameron’s contributions in modernizing jazz harmony, arranging for small group settings, and mentoring the next generation of musicians. Combs was urged to write the book by Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Rouse, and Art Blakey, and it was endorsed by Benny Golson, who wrote the foreword  Performances of Dameron's music by Paul Combs  In 2017, Combs’s quintet performed a Centenntial Dameron Tribute Concert of Dameron’s music at the Smithsonian Institution. The Combs quintet also played the music of Tadd Dameron as part of the Jazz Live concert series presented by radio station KSDS-FM. Three tracks from this concert are included in the CD Unknown Dameron,which contains rare and previously unrecorded compositions by Dameron. The album was recognized by critics for its content and quality. Combs also appeared at the 2019 Tri-C Jazzfest, which celebrates the work of Cleveland's musicians.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. At the time of its nomination it consisted of 28 resources, which included 21 contributing buildings, one contributing site, one contributing structure, and five non-contributing buildings. The area was previously a part of the notorious Bucktown, a district of saloons, beer gardens, brothels, billiard parlors, gambling establishments, and theaters. Davenport licensed prostitution in 1893, gambling in 1904, and failed to enforce Iowa prohibition laws during this period. A crusade against vice by Davenport's Catholic bishop, Henry Cosgrove, and reforms by state leaders led to the district's transformation in the early 20th century into a light industrial area. The city's automobile industry settled here beginning in the 1910s. They stayed until the mid-20th century when Interstate 80 was completed on the north side of the city and they moved to the suburban areas. U.S. Route 32 and its successor U.S. Route 6 passed through the district on East Second Street from 1926 to 1937. The Government Bridge (1896), which for years was the city's only bridge across the Mississippi River, is immediately adjacent to the district. The district can be divided into two sections based on building usage. On the south side between River Drive and East Second Street are the manufacturing, jobbing, and warehousing buildings. The location of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific rail siding was in the alley, now known as Emerson Place. The alley is the contributing site. To the north between East Second and Third Streets is the location for the automobile industry buildings. These include gas and service stations, auto dealerships, tire and auto parts service and stores, an implement dealership, and a taxi company garage. The elevated rail bridge at East Third and Iowa Streets is the contributing structure. Hose Station No. 1 (1877), which housed automotive uses on its first floor from the 1930s to the 1950s, and the Davenport Bag and Paper Company Building (1907) are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A block north of this historic district is the Crescent Warehouse Historic District, another former light industrial area. The Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District, a larger commercial district, is immediately to the west.

History  BALSAC was created in 1972 at the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi in partnership with Université Laval, McGill University, and the Université de Montréal on the initiative of Gérard Bouchard. The data are derived from vital records, mostly marriage certificates, that are connected through record linkage. These records can be combined for studies in disciplines such as human genetics, demography, geography, sociology, and history. The first milestone of the project was to recreate the population of Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean from over 660,000 baptisms, marriages, and deaths in the region between 1838 and 1971. The database was expanded progressively to the entirety of Quebec's territory for the 19th and 20th centuries by matching data to marriage certificates, with the exception of a few regions for which baptismal and burial records were already digitized (Charlevoix and the Iles- de-la-Madeleine in part). In 2016, the linkage of nearly all Catholic marriages (around 1.25 million records) in Quebec from 1800 to 1940 was completed.

The peak population of Rooster Town was from about the mid-1930s to 1945, with close to 250 residents. Throughout the 1950s, many residents left under pressure from developers to relocate.

It was published anonymously in 1790.  Synopsis  The novel follows the life of Louisa Conolly, a woman who enjoys flirting ('coquetry'). After she marries Henry Mortimer, she continues to flirt with other men. This causes her husband considerable anxiety, although Louisa remains physically faithful to him. Whilst Louisa is pregnant, Henry fights in a duel to defend her reputation. He is fatally wounded, and the shock causes Louisa to give birth prematurely. Henry and Louisa's child is born dead, and Louisa herself also dies shortly afterwards.  Reception  The Dangers of Coquetry attracted little attention when it was first published. Although the novel cautions readers about the dangers of flirting, Opie also depicted Louisa as a flawed yet ultimately sympathetic figure. One contemporary reviewer was far more critical of Henry's behaviour than hers, writing that: 'while it [the novel] attributes the most mischievous and dreadful consequences to a little innocent coquetry in the character of a wife, it shews them to have proceeded from an idle, ridiculous, and unfounded jealousy on the part of her husband. Teresa Pershing suggests that although Opie portrays Louisa as an example of failed femininity, she also shows that society's narrow notions of acceptable female behaviour are flawed. The novel uses some standard tropes found in 'coquette narratives' written at the time (particularly in that the coquette dies tragically), but is also unusual in that Louisa is married. Pershing argues that Dangers of Coquetry therefore \\"reveals marriage’s inability to contain emotional and erotic desire\\".

The book is based on the French comedy Le souris d'hôtel by Marcel Gerbidon and Paul ArmontDietz, Dan. The Complete Book of 1920s Broadway Musicals, p. 104–105, Rowman & Littlefield (2019) and concerns a female cat burglar in Monte Carlo given the nickname \\"the hotel mouse\\" by the local police; one of her marks falls in love with her. It was produced in 1922 on Broadway by the Shubert brothers,Mantle, Burns, ed., The Best Plays of 1921–22, Small, Maynard & Company, Boston, 1922, p. 526. followed by a tour. Background Sheet Music The piece was originally titled Little Miss Raffles, but the composer died before finishing the score, notwithstanding the erroneous headline of November 30, 1921, in The New York Times: \\"Ivan Caryll dies as he finishes play – Noted Composer Stricken With Hemorrhage at rehearsal of Little Miss Raffles\\". The article went on to say, “His death came just a week before his latest 'comedy with music', as he liked to term his works, was to have its first performance in New Haven.The New York Times, November 30, 1921, p. 14 On December 1, 1921, the same newspaper reported that Little Miss Raffles would be presented at the Astor Theatre on December 13, 1921. It further reported that it \\"will have Vivienne Segal and Lawrence Grossmith in the leading roles.\\"The New York Times, December 1, 1921, p. 24. The show did not play at the Astor; after Caryll's death, it was completed, renamed The Hotel Mouse, and produced at the Shubert three months later with a different cast and with music mostly by Armand Vecsey. Production The Hotel Mouse premiered on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre on March 13, 1922, and closed on May 27, 1922, after 88 performances. It was staged by John Harwood and choreographed by Max Scheck, with scenic and costume design by Watson Barratt. The music director was Ira Jacobs. The original cast included Frances White as Mauricette, Taylor Holmes as Wally Gordon, Barnett Parker as Burroughs and Fay Marbe as Lola. The New York Times opening night review said: “It is not quite fair to apply the word ‘cute’ to Francis White, for she is a good deal more than that. Last night's audience was never quite able to get enough of her. ... She has a new song with a riddle in it – one that the audience demanded to hear six or seven times last night, and which, as Miss White sang it, was well worth the encores.” The Broadway production was followed by a tour. On May 28, 1922, The New York Times reported: “The Hotel Mouse with Frances White and Taylor Holmes, now moves to Chicago.”The New York Times, May 28, 1922, p. 70 The play by Paul Armont and Marcel Gerbidon that was the basis of the musical was also the basis of the 1923 British silent crime film of the same name.BFI.org Plot In Monte Carlo, a young woman, Mauricette, is known to the police as \\"The Hotel Mouse\\". Although she is a good girl, she had been taught in her childhood to be a thief. An accomplished cat burglar and master of disguise, she has the uncanny skill to sneak in and out of hotels on the Riviera and steal jewelry from the rich patrons. One night she is holed up at the Hotel des Anglais in the room of Wally Gordon, a rich young man. Wally falls in love with Mauricette and protects her from the detectives waiting in the hall even though he has caught her trying to steal from his room.

In 697, upon al-Hajjaj's order, he carried out the conversion of the Persian-language Iraqi dīwān into Arabic. Origins The year of Salih's birth is not known. He was one of at least two sons of a mawlā (Muslim convert or freedman) originally from Sijistan called Abd al-Rahman. The latter had been taken captive in 650/51 by the troops of Rabi ibn Ziyad al-Harithi, an Arab commander dispatched to Sijistan by the governor of Basra, Abd Allah ibn Amir, who at the time was leading an expedition in Khurasan. Together with his wife, Abd al-Rahman, whose original name is not known, was captured in the village of Nashrudh during one of Rabi's raids in the vicinity of Zaranj. They were brought to the Arab garrison town and provincial center of Basra, where both were purchased by a certain Abla, a woman of the Banu Tamim, and then freed by her upon their conversion to Islam. Career =Administration of Iraq under al-Hajjaj= During the governorship of al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf over Iraq, Salih entered the dīwān (bureaucratic administration) of Basra under the mentorship of the Persian Zoroastrian administrator Zadhanfarrukh. At the time, the language of bureaucracy in Iraq and the eastern half of the Caliphate was Persian. Unlike Zadhanfarrukh, Salih was fluent in Arabic as well as Persian, due to his Muslim upbringing in Basra. This knowledge combined with his demonstrable competence and frugality caught the attention of al-Hajjaj. When the latter moved to convert the Persian tax records of Iraq's central dīwān to Arabic in 697, he entrusted Salih with the task. The local and provincial dīwāns in Iraq and the eastern provinces remained Persian for many years after the change, and Salih was charged with training his bureaucrats to adopt the new Arabic system. His efforts were met with resistance by Zadhanfarrukh, the latter's son Mardanshah and the veteran Persian bureaucrats. Mardanshah attempted to convince him of the inability of Arabic to translate Persian fractions (Arabic did not have forms for fractions below tenths), which Salih solved by using tenths and half-tenths. Mardanshah also attempted to bribe Salih with 100,000 silver dirhams to persuade al-Hajjaj of his inability to effect the language changes, but Salih refused. Nonetheless, he did not inform al-Hajjaj of his colleagues' attempts to void his assignment, which would have led to their dismissals and possible executions. The next generation of Iraqi tax administrators were the pupils of Salih and held him in high esteem. The kātib (scribe) of Caliph Marwan II, Abd al-Hamid ibn Yahya, noted this, saying: \\"What a man Salih was! How great his favor to the scribes\\". Despite his integral role in the administration, Salih did not hold an official post under al-Hajjaj; the caliphs Abd al-Malik () and al-Walid I () combined the military and fiscal responsibilities of Iraq and the east into the singular authority of al-Hajjaj. Salih was referred to as the ṣāḥib dawāwīn, akin to the superintendent of Iraq's central tax bureaux in Wasit. When, in 702, al-Hajjaj built Wasit as the new capital of Iraq and the garrison of his elite Syrian troops, the costs of construction totaled 43,000,000 dirhams, a sum far more expensive than the governor had anticipated. To rectify the budget, Salih attributed about 80% of the cost to war expenses, and the remainder to construction. Salih was suspected of harboring sympathies for proto-Shu'ubiyya Kharijites. To test his loyalty, al-Hajjaj, at the prodding of his protege Yazid ibn Abi Muslim, commanded Salih to execute the captive Kharijite leader Jawwab al-Dabbi. Fearing for the welfare of his daughters should he refuse, Salih carried out the killing. =Fiscal governor of Iraq= Shortly after his accession, Caliph Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik () removed the deputy governors and commanders appointed or associated with al-Hajjaj, including the latter's successor in Iraq, Yazid ibn Abi Muslim. In his place, he appointed Yazid ibn al-Muhallab as governor of Iraq for its military and religious affairs and Salih as fiscal governor of the province. Salih's appointment was recommended by Ibn al-Muhallab, who was disinterested in responsibility over tax collection. Nonetheless, as he was directly appointed by Sulayman, he answered to the caliph and was a near equal in rank to Ibn al-Muhallab. Though he generally did not restrict funding for the army or provisions, Salih frequently stopped attempts by Ibn al-Muhallab to squander treasury funds for personal use. Reflecting on his own role in Salih's appointment, Ibn al- Muhallab expressed his frustration: \\"This is what I have done to myself\\". Sulayman charged Salih with the arrest, torture and execution of several member of the Abu Aqil clan to which al-Hajjaj belonged. Among the prisoners in Wasit, the headquarters of Salih, was the conqueror and governor of Sind, Muhammad ibn Qasim, and his brother al-Hajjaj ibn Qasim, the latter of whom had killed Salih's brother Adam for his active role with Kharijite rebels. Salih followed the order and charged Ibn al-Muhallab's brother, Abd al-Malik, with supervising the torture. Among Salih's achievements was the construction of a governor's house in Basra. Though Wasit was established as Iraq's capital, Basra and Kufa still served as subgovernorships and Salih sought to replace the ruined clay palace built by a previous governor, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad. After gaining Sulayman's approval for the construction, Salih had a taller, less expensive palace built, the first in the city to consist of baked brick and gypsum. =Later life and death= Salih's fortunes changed abruptly with the death of Sulayman and the accession Umar II () in September 717. Salih was dismissed by the caliph and likely retired from the public sector. At some point, he relocated the caliph's court in Syria during the reign of Caliph Yazid II (), who was deferential to Salih. Shortly after the accession of Yazid II, Ibn al-Muhallab raised a mass revolt against the Umayyads in Iraq, which was stamped out by the governor Umar ibn Hubayra al-Fazari and the caliph's brother Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik. Afterward, Ibn Hubayra sought to snuff out Ibn al-Muhallab's associates in the province and override the system of tax management established by Salih. He remained wary of the latter's influence. Seeking to find a cause to have him arrested, Ibn Hubayra charged a bureaucrat from Anbar with scouring the budget records to find any violations that Salih may have committed. They were not successful, but pinned on him a major discrepancy of 600,000 dirhams by Ibn al-Muhallab. Ibn Hubayra submitted the complaint to the caliph, who consequently arrested and sent Salih for prosecution in Iraq. There, Ibn Hubayra personally tortured him to death. In the assessment of the historian Martin Sprengling, \\"Salih ibn Abdalrahman remains a sad, lonely figure, outstanding, of most extraordinary ability, rising for his moment to heights far above the average, then melting completely out of sight\\". His memory was preserved by his pupils and successors in Iraq's dīwān. Among them were Ibn al-Muqaffa', who wrote of him fondly, the mawlā Abd al-Hamid ibn Yahya who considered Salih the greatest benefactor of the Umayyad-era scribes, and Qahdam, the Persian progenitor of several generations of scribes who were active during the early Abbasid Caliphate.

Lincoln Hills was created in 1922 by E.C. Regnier and Roger Ewalt and was the only resort for African Americans west of the Mississippi River. Lincoln Hills served as a reprieve from segregation for middle class African-Americans in the 20th century.  Creation  By the 1920s, Denver had a thriving African American population living largely in the Five Points neighborhood. However, due to rising racial tensions in America and the presence of the Ku Klux Klan in Denver many African Americans faced hostility living in Denver. Denver businessmen E.C. Regnier and Roger Ewalt co-founded Lincoln Hills Development Company (LHDC) in 1922. Regnier and Ewalt, both African American men, purchased over 100 acres 38 miles West of Denver. Regnier and Ewalt believed African Americans should be able to enjoy the mountain landscape and have a resort to escape the racial tensions of Denver. The men sold small land plots to African Americans which were usually 25 ft by 100 ft and had a price ranging from $5-$100. Many plots were used as campsites, however some families built rustic cabins. Regnier and Ewalt sold over 600 plots of land to middle class African American families who were located all across Colorado.  Legacy  Lincoln Hills grew in size throughout the early 20th century and came to serve as renowned mountain resort for African American families. The resort served as the location for Camp Nizhoni, a YMCA girls camp that served African American women and girls who were prohibited from attending other YMCA camps due to segregation. Memoirs from Lincoln Hills describe the picturesque mountain landscape and the camaraderie that formed between many African American families who would return to the resort annually. During the Great Depression many African American families were forced to abandon their annual vacation plans. Moreover, the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 allowed for the integration of African Americans into White resorts and clubs, thus Lincoln Hills had less of an appeal. Lincoln Hills officially closed in 1966. In 1980 Lincoln Hills was placed on the National Register of Historic Places due to the unique opportunity it afforded African American families. In 2007, Matthew Burkett purchased the resort to preserve it. Currently, the non-profit organization Lincoln Hills Cares operates youth and family programs at the resort to expand access to the outdoors to African American and Latino families in the Denver region.

It is visible to the naked eye as a dim, blue-white hued point of light with a baseline apparent visual magnitude of 5.23. The system is drifting closer to the Earth with a mean heliocentric radial velocity of –12.5. It is a probable member of the I Lacertae OB association (Lac OB1). The primary component is a Beta Cephei variable with a stellar classification of B1.5III, matching a B-type star with the luminosity class of a giant star. It has been known to be variable for more than a century and has been extensively studied. The variable radial velocity of the star was discovered by W. S. Adams in 1912, and the light variations were established by 1919. The pulsational nature of the variability was shown by P. Ledoux in 1951, which led to one of the first world-wide observing campaigns with the star as its target. Dutch mathematician F. J. M. Barning analyzed the resulting data in 1963 and found four separate cycles of variation. By 1994, six periods had been confirmed. The variable star designation of the primary is DD Lacertae, while 12 Lacertae is the Flamsteed designation. In general terms it varies in magnitude from 5.16 down to 5.28 with a period of . As many as eleven different frequencies have been detected, with the dominant cycle showing a frequency of 5.179034 cycles per day. Curiously, three of the frequencies form an equally-spaced triplet with cycles of 5.179, 5.334, and 5.490 per day, although this alignment appears to be a coincidence. It is a hybrid pulsator, showing mixed behaviors of a Beta Cephei variable and a slowly pulsating B-type star. The primary is a massive star, having 9.5 times the mass of the Sun and an age of only 22 million years old. It has about 8.4 times the girth of the Sun. The averaged quadratic field strength of the surface magnetic field is . It is radiating 8,877 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 23,809 K. The estimated rotational velocity of the primary at the equator is ; about 10% of its break-up velocity. However, seismic models suggest the core region is rotating much more rapidly with a rotational velocity of up to , and thus the star is undergoing differential rotation. The companion is an A-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of A3V and visual magnitude 9.2. As of 2008, it had an angular separation of from the primary. There is a faint infrared nebulosity at a separation of from the pair that is most likely a bow shock.

After graduating, he worked with Bordoni in 1919 on the development of the Motoscafo Armato Silurante, a MAS-boot (torpedo boat). GRB-OPRA In 1923, together with Carlo Gianini, Remor built a transverse inline four-cylinder engine for a motorcycle. This project caught the attention of Count Luigi Bonmartini who owned the Officine di Precisione Romane Automobilistiche (OPRA) company in Rome. Bonmartini decided to provide financial support by establishing a new company together with Remor and Gianini. This company was initially named \\"GRB\\" (Gianini, Remor, Bonmartini). To earn money, however, work also had to be carried out for the aviation industry and it took five years for a prototype of a motorcycle to be built. This was an air cooled four-cylinder with probably a water-cooled cylinder head that was built in a very simple frame. In 1929 the prototype was now called \\"OPRA\\" and Piero Taruffi. made a name for himself with Nortons as a motorcycle racer, was hired as a test driver. However, when the OPRA entered its first race, the Grand Prix of Rome, it was driven by a then more famous driver, Umberto Faraglia. The OPRA led the race for a short time, but the engine blew up.

Piero Remor left the OPRA company in 1930 after a dispute with Count Bonmartini. =Development of the racing engine= Meanwhile, Piero Taruffi and Carlo Gianini continued to develop the motorcycle, which in the meantime was called \\"CNA Rondine\\", after another company from Bonmartini, Compagnia Nazionale Aeronautica, and the Rondine aeroplane that flew over the 1922 March on Rome. The developments there were again particularly slow, but it was not until 1934 that the motorcycle came back onto the track under the name \\"Rondine\\" (swallow). The engine, which was completely revised only by Gianini, was now completely water-cooled and a Roots supercharger. Six copies of the Rondine were built. Taruffi and Amilcare Rossetti rode the machines in the prestigious Grand Prix of Tripoli, where they came first and second. Taruffi drove a fully streamlined version to a record 244.6 km/h. In 1934 Bonmartini sold CNA to the aircraft manufacturer Caproni in Milan. That company had no interest in the Rondine and Piero Taruffi feared that his project, in which he had been involved for eight years, would be lost. That is why he approached Giuseppe Gilera, who was convinced of the advertising aspect of road races for his Gilera brand. Gilera bought the six machines, drawings, rights, spare parts and hired Taruffi as rider, team leader and chief engineer. However, Gilera also saw the weaknesses of the machine and the need to have it developed further before it was used in races. Officine Meccaniche After leaving OPRA, Remor joined the Officine Meccaniche (OM) car factory in Brescia. There he designed the 1500cc four- cylinder engine for the \\"Typo M\\". When Fiat took over the OM brand in 1938 and ceased car production in favour of the production of trucks, Piero Remor started looking for other work. Gilera In 1939 Taruffi persuaded Remor to join Gilera to further develop the 500cc Rondine, but Piero Remor began developing a 250cc four-cylinder machine with a supercharger and the rear suspension of the Rondine. Due to the outbreak of the Second World War, all developments for racing came to a halt. In 1946, the FIM prohibited the use of superchargers, forcing Gilera to use the single-cylinder Saturno Competizione as the factory racer. It was no match for machines such as the Moto Guzzi Bicilindrica 500, the Moto Guzzi Gambalunga, the Norton Manx and the AJS Porcupine. In that year, Gilera commissioned Piero Remor to develop a new racer. Piero Taruffi had left the company to focus on his career as a racing driver. Remor did not start from the 500 cc Rondine, but enlarged his own 1940 250 cc prototype to 500 cc. In 1947, the Gilera 500 4C began to take shape and in 1948 the first tests were carried out by Carlo Bandirola and Massimo Masserini on the Milan-Bergamo motorway. There were major problems with lubrication and a lot of time was needed to resolve them. In 1948, Nello Pagani rode the machine in its first race in Cesena, but retired due to poor handling. Remor was not happy with that, but the fact is that the machine couldn't break points that year. Even winning the Italian championship was not achievable. Masserini led the Assen TT, but fell in the heavy rain. Only the last race of the year, the Grand Prix of Italy, was won by Masserini, mainly because Norton and AJS did not enter. Although it was clear to everyone that the steering behaviour was below par, Remor refused to improve the machine. The fight with Pagani was intense that Remor forbade him to ride on the four- cylinder machine forcing him to use the Saturno. In the 1949 World Championship it became clear that the handling of the Gilera was not good. The first world title went to Les Graham with the AJS Porcupine, a machine that weighed around 140 kg and delivered only 45 bhp, while the Gilera weighed 124 kg and had over 50 hp. After two races, Giuseppe Gilera intervened and Pagani got the four-cylinder for the Assen TT, with which he easily won. With a win at the Grand Prix of Italy, Gilera had only won two races in the first world championship year with a motorcycle that was the best on paper. At the end of the 1949 season Piero Remor had to leave Gilera because most riders were unable to work with him. The initial difficulties in resolving lubrication problems and his refusal to correct bad steering behaviour or even to acknowledge that it existed were no longer acceptable. =Relationships with riders= Piero Remor always had a difficult relationship with his riders, because they blamed each other when results were disappointing: * Nello Pagani complained about the steering qualities of the Gilera 500 4C. In 1948 he even retired from a race because of the bad handling. Remor refused to improve the machine and forbade Pagani to ride the four-cylinder machine. In 1949, Giuseppe Gilera intervened personally: he gave Pagani the four-cylinder and fired Remor. * Arciso Artesiani, according to the Italian press, was blamed by his employer Gilera for not having won the constructor's title in 1949. According to Artesiani this was the fault of Piero Remor, who during the Ulster Grand Prix only had part of the engine oil changed to save time, which caused the engine to seize. MV Agusta Count Domenico Agusta was determined to make MV Agusta one of the leading motorcycle marques. In 1950 Augusta hired Pietro Remor to build two GP machines: a four-cylinder 500 cc and a DOHC 125 cc. MV Agusta was still racing in the 125 cc class with a two-stroke engine, which was not competitive with the four-strokes of Mondial and Morini. For MV Agusta, the 125cc Bialbero became the first racing engine that was not derived from a production model. On his departure from Gilera, Remor took the blueprints of the 500/4 engine with him. These provided the basis for MV Agusta's new 500cc four-cylinder machine, the MV Agusta 500 4C. From drawing board to test track it only took 15 weeks, but that was not surprising because the engine was almost identical to the Gilera 500 4C. MV Agusta and Gilera thus competed in the 1950 Championship with almost the same motorcycles, something that Gilera were not happy with. When driver Arciso Artesiani also left for MV Agusta, they even spoke of \\"betrayal\\". However, Artesiani did not have much choice. He was an MV Agusta dealer in Bologna and received a generous salary of 800,000 lire and a motorcycle. The MV Agusta 500 4C was presented during the trade fair at Milan in 1950. The main difference with the Gilera 500 4C was the shaft drive of the MV. at the front was a chrome- molybdenum Girder fork and in the back was a double swinging arm with torsion springs and friction dampers. The engine block was also not exactly the same as that of the Gilera: with the MV Agusta the cylinder heads could be removed whereas on the Gilera they were cast in one piece with the cylinder block. On 1 May 1950, engineer Arturo Magni also came to MV Agusta and became responsible for the further development of the racing engine. Magni had previously worked with Remor at Gilera. Motom After leaving MV Agusta at the end of 1953, Piero Remor worked at Motom, who maufatured mopeds and light motorcycles, from 1954 to 1957. Whilst at Motom, he developed the small Motom 98T. He later became a consultant and died in Rome in 1964.

Early life Galvin was born on May 4, 1854 in Somerville, Massachusetts. His father was a florist and one of his brothers, J. Mitchel Galvin, was also a politician. Galvin attended Boston College and graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1876. Medicine After graduating from Harvard, Galvin spent a year as an intern at Boston City Hospital. He then spent three years as an assistant at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary before starting a private practice in Boston's impoverished South Cove district. Galvin's experience in South Cove made him want to create an hospital that would provide emergency medical services at little or no cost. On July 3, 1891, Galvin founded the Boston Emergency and General Hospital (then known as the Emergency Accident Hospital). It was the first emergency hospital in the United States. He served as the hospital's superintendent and chief surgeon. The hospital operated on a cooperative plan. A patient would pay $1 for membership in the hospital association, which would grant them access to medical and surgical services as well as filling of prescriptions at wholesale price. The hospital treated over a half million patients during Galvin's tenure as president. On March 10, 1906, Galvin left the emergency hospital due to his disagreement with the board of director's desire to increase space for private patients and run the institution as a more general hospital. Politics Galvin was an active member of the Socialist Party. He was a friend of Jack London and persuaded him to speak on Socialism at Faneuil Hall. On June 5, 1903, Socialist leader James F. Carey married Clara L. Stevens at Galvin's residence above the emergency hospital. The ceremony was presided by socialist preacher George E. Littlefield and only socialists were in attendance. Galvin was the Socialist Party nominee for Mayor of Boston in 1903 and received 7% of the vote. In 1903, Galvin brought a list of 22 charges against the Boston police commissioners, which included granting special privileges towards specific liquor dealers and discriminating against others, allowing unlicensed sale of liquor Hotel Touraine, and interfered with the activities of the emergency hospital. Governor John L. Bates dismissed the charges due to insufficient evidence. In 1904, Galvin worked to gain the released of Levi Brigham, an inmate who had been in solitary confinement at the Bridgewater State Hospital for two and a half years following a seven year sentence for larceny. Afterwards he began speaking out against the conditions of the state's prisons. On August 26, 1904, he appeared at a mass meeting presided by Boston University professor Frank Parsons where he alleged that cruel and illegal practices were taking place in Charlestown State Prison and the state's other prisons and mental hospitals. He had three articles regarding the treatment of prisoners - \\"Our Legal Machinery And Its Victims\\", \\"Inhuman Treatment of Prisoners In Massachusetts\\", and \\"Justice For The Criminal\\", published The Arena. On October 28, 1913, Galvin testified before the State Board of Insanity on behalf of 43 nurses from Worcester State Hospital who signed a petition alleging poor treatment of patients. Galvin demonstrated \\"sheeting\\", a punishment where a bed sheet was tied tightly around an unruly patient's head. Five nurses testified that this was a common practice because they needed to protect themselves. Later career and death After leaving the emergency hospital, Galvin ran a private practice in Boston. In 1911 he was expelled from the Massachusetts Medical Society for violating its ethics and bylaws by advertising Dr. Paul Ehrlich's remedy for virulent disease. He refused to apologize and instead defended his actions as the only means he knew to publicize this important discovery. In 1928, Galvin became seriously ill following a hemorrhage. He spent two weeks in the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. Galvin died at his home on August 17, 1928 from inoperable cancer.

It explores issues concerning mother-daughter relationships, female education, and the unfairness of patriarchal marriage customs. Opie set part of the novel in Paris (which she had visited in 1802), where her characters take what is 'tantamount to a tourist trip around places of revolutionary bloodshed'.  Synopsis  Temper follows the instruction of its heroine, Emma. She is the daughter of Agatha Torrington, and the granddaughter of Emma Castlemain. Opie criticizes both Agatha and the older Emma for not correctly educating their daughters. Agatha's own lax education is partly responsible for her unwise marriage to George Danvers. He turns out to be a libertine, who deserts her and their daughter Emma. Agatha tries to get proof that her marriage was lawful, but the relevant page has been torn out of the marriage register. As a result, Emma is potentially illegitimate. Emma later becomes the ward of a clergyman, Mr. Egerton, who provides her with an appropriate education. She and Henry St Aubyn fall in love, and he is finally able to prove that Emma is legitimate. After this revelation, he and Emma marry.  Reception  In the novel, Opie cited William Hayley's popular poem The Triumphs of Temper. This sparked a long and friendly correspondence between Opie and Hayley, which lasted until his death in 1820. Temper has one of Opie's more optimistic endings: Emma is the first of her heroines not to die tragically.

Explanation A set A of lambda terms is closed under beta-convertibility if for any lambda terms X and Y, if X \\\\in A and X is β-equivalent to Y then Y \\\\in A. Two sets A and B of natural numbers are recursively separable if there exists a computable function f : \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\rightarrow \\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\} such that f(a) = 0 if a \\\\in A and f(b) = 1 if b \\\\in B. Two sets of lambda terms are recursively separable if their corresponding sets under a Gödel numbering are recursively separable, and recursively inseparable otherwise. The Scott–Curry theorem applies equally to sets of terms in combinatory logic with weak equality. It has parallels to Rice's theorem in computability theorem, which states that all non-trivial semantic properties of programs are undecidable. The theorem has the immediate consequence that it is an undecidable problem to determine if two lambda terms are β-equivalent. Proof The proof is adapted from Barendregt in The Lambda Calculus. Let A and B be closed under beta- convertibility and let a and b be lambda term representations of elements from A and B respectively. Suppose for a contradiction that f is a lambda term representing a computable function such that fx = 0 if x \\\\in A and fx = 1 if x \\\\in B (where equality is β-equality). Then define G \\\\equiv \\\\lambda x.\\\\text{if}\\\\ (\\\\text{zero?} \\\\ (Fx)) a b. Here, \\\\text{zero?} is true if its argument is zero and false otherwise, and \\\\text{if} is the identity so that \\\\text{if}\\\\ b x y is equal to x if b is true and y if b is false. Then x \\\\in C \\\\implies Gx = a and similarly, x otin C \\\\implies Gx = b. By the Second Recursion Theorem, there is a term X which is equal to f applied to the Church numeral of its Gödel numbering, X. Then X \\\\in C implies that X = G(X') = b so in fact X otin C. The reverse assumption X otin C gives X = G(X') = a so X \\\\in C. Either way we arise at a contradiction, and so f cannot be a function which separates A and B. Hence A and B are recursively inseparable. History Dana Scott first proved the theorem in 1963. The theorem, in a slightly less general form, was independently proven by Haskell Curry. It was published in Curry's 1969 paper \\"The undecidability of λK-conversion\\".

When the pair are sent across the Mexican border disguised as smugglers to break up a gang, they both fall in love with Dolores (Josephine Dunn), the dancer in a Mexican cantina where the smugglers led by Pascal (Richard Cramer), hang out. When Andy visits Dolores at the cantina, he is captured by the smugglers. One of the gang discover the aircraft that Jerry and Andy have hidden away and see the air patrol logo on its side. Andy escapes and takes off in his aircraft, followed by the smugglers. In the air battle that follows, Andy is shot down, but before he dies, he relays a message to Jerry. Refusing help from his fellow air police, Jerry determines to avenge Andy's death. Suspecting that Dolores was helping Pascal, he flies across the border to confronts her at the cantina.

Description Eucalyptus erosa is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous to stringy, grey bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have narrow lance-shaped, to egg- shaped leaves long, wide and are a much darker green on one side. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same shade of green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of nine, eleven or thirteen in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum with a small point on the top. Flowering has been recorded in May and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves level with the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus erosa was first described in 2005 by Anthony Bean from a specimen he collected in the Maranoa district in 1981 and the description was published in the journal Austrobaileya. The specific epithet (erosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"eaten away\\", \\"gnawed\\" or \\"nibbled\\", referring to the edges of the adult leaves.

The entire route is part of the Halifax spur of The Great Trail, and follows Nova Scotia Route 357 for its length. History The railbed that the trail uses was originally built by the Intercolonial Railway just prior to World War I and absorbed into Canadian National when the Government of Canada created it. The rails originally ran from Dartmouth to Upper Musquodoboit, hauling timber, gravel, and agricultural goods, as well as passengers. An extension to Guysborough was planned, but never materialized. Route The trailway begins at the Musquodoboit Harbour Railway Museum, but it mostly considered starting at Park Road, a few hundred meters north of Nova Scotia Trunk 7 in Musquodoboit Harbour, and almost immediately crosses the Trestle Bridge, a steel truss bridge over the Musquodoboit River, offering a view of its extensive and largely undeveloped flood plains. Soon thereafter, the old Bayer Mill Road is passed on the left, and to the right, tall granite cliffs of the Eastern Shore Granite Ridge become visible, some reaching up to in height.

Beyond the picnic table lie the Turtle Cove bridge, a wooden trestle bridge, and another trailhead for the Admiral Lake Loop, as well as the South Granite Ridge Trail. From this point onwards the trail passes mainly through the rich lower Musquodoboit Valley, sometimes approaching the granite cliffs to the east, sometimes with glimpses of the river to the west. At around the halfway point is Norma's Place, a picnic shelter, and a connection to the North and South Granite Ridge Trails. The trail continues over Kelly's Meadow Bridge and through the valley until coming to another picnic table at .

The company was formed in 1901 with its headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Beginning in 1915, its main lumber production facility was in Bend, Oregon. For many years, its Bend sawmill was one of the largest lumber producers in the world. In 1969, the company created Brooks Resources to broaden its business base beyond timber production. Brooks-Scanlon's Bend sawmill was closed in 1994. Today, Brooks Resources is the only vestige of the company that is still in business.  Founding  The Brooks-Scanlon Lumber Company was formed in 1901 with its headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The founding partners were Michael J. Scanlon, Anson S. Brooks, Dwight F. Brooks, Lester R. Brooks, and Henry E. Gibson. The firm was originally capitalized with $500,000. The partners later increased their capital investment to $1,750,000.\\"Michael J.

Eventually, local timber resources became scarce and the company began looking for new timber resources outside Minnesota. The Brooks-Scanlon sawmill in Cloquet closed in 1909, after cutting of timber. That completely exhausted the supply of standing timber in the area around the mill. The company announced that the mill would be disassembled and shipped west.\\"Scanlon Mill Closes\\", Virginia Enterprise, Viginia, Minnesota, 13 April 1909, p.87.

It was Opie's last completed novel, and explores issues of class, gender and insanity.  Synopsis  The novel is told in the first-person, by its heroine Madeline Munro. Born to poor Scottish cottagers, as a child Madeline was adopted and brought up by a wealthy couple. When her patroness dies, she returns to her birth family. She falls in love with Mr. Falconer, the local laird, and the couple have a 'Scotch marriage' (these were not officiated by an officially sanctioned authority, but were nevertheless still legally binding in Scotland). Falconer insists that the marriage must be kept secret because Madeline's lower social status will anger his sister, and also because it will help his career if people think he is still a bachelor. Opie portrays Falconer as a selfish and unworthy character; whereas Maclean, a clergyman whom she might have married, is consistently shown as a good and worthy man. Madeline, although Falconer's lawful wife, must now pretend to be his mistress. Opie has Madeline face similar problems to her more well-known heroine Adeline Mowbray (including the fact that other men will try to sexually exploit her because they think that she is a mistress). Madeline's mental and physical health deteriorates. When it seems that Falconer is about to abandon her, she proactively sets out to dissolve their marriage, and travels to London with their baby son. She manages to sell several of her own paintings, and makes enough money to live comfortably in London with her son. Although broken-hearted at separating from her husband, she concludes that it is better to claim her freedom and be seen by society as a 'dishonourable' woman than to remain in a loveless clandestine marriage. Eventually, Falconer and Madeline's marriage is publicly acknowledged. Madeline is very ill, but after a contrite Glencarron brings her parents to his estate and tries to mend bonds between the families, she finally recovers.  Reception  Madeline was one of Opie's least commercially successful works. David Thame calls the novel 'the summation of Opie's craft' as a writer, and that 'Opie transcends the convention of the love mad woman'. Meghan Burke Hattaway argues that the novel is more unconventional than it first appears, particularly in the figure of Madeline: > 'Secure in the sense of her own righteousness and supporting herself > mentally and financially through modes of self-expression (as she writes for > her sanity, and paints for her money), Madeline disregards the > unsatisfactory available roles of “wife” or “whore” and is instead posed to > survive and thrive respectably in an identity of her own making'.

In the 11th century it was developed into a fortress with a military garrison that likely protected the nearby trade city of Sijilmasa, where gold coins were minted, and the trade routes from the south. Representatives of the Almoravid dynasty likely had the fortifications built, which included a wall of up to 12 meters high that closed off the only opening to the massif, two walls and defensive structures along the mountains, dams in the canyons to collect water, and a variety of structures on the plateaus. The massif was studied by Moroccan sociologist Paul Pascon. Starting with the 1999 film The Mummy, it has also been used as a filming location, and has become a tourist attraction especially for off-roaders. Description and location Jebel Mudawwar is located to the west of the principal tell of Sijilmasa, in the Tafilalt region. It is a limestone massif that rises above the desert. The entire area measures about 50 hectares. Most of the perimeter consists of vertical rocks with scree at the bottom. In the south/southwest, the circular formation is broken by a ravine, which continues into the formation as a wadi, providing entrance into the heart of the massif. The wadi starts after the confluence of four ravines, which divide the higher ground into five plateaus; at this confluence is a great circle of rock, surrounded by the overhanging plateaus. There is no source of water. Erosion has washed away all loose material, leaving only spurs, and the gara presents itself as essentially a funnel with the constituent canyons leading toward a single exit. =Structures: walls and dams= Two dams in one of the ravines The formation, like the fortress of Tasghîmût near Marrakesh, is strategically located and naturally forms an almost complete fortress. Gara Medouar has only one large opening, a ravine in the south; about one third of the mountain's perimeter has been fortified by walls, the most important of which is the wall going straight across the ravine in the south. This well-preserved wall (the \\"low wall\\") is high where it abuts the rocks, and in places rises to ; it is long and about thick, and consists of limestone blocks held together with lime mortar. Two \\"higher\\" walls are on the slopes. The shortest of the two is in the south and joins the low wall on its eastern end, where a gate was; the longest higher wall runs from the western end (at a bastion) almost to the northern tip of the massif. There may have been a postern, in about the middle of the western wall. The higher walls are up to thick, and between high. This higher wall allows for surveillance of the entire area south of the massif, and gaps between the rocks are filled in with masonry. It is here that Paul Pascon thought he recognized four towers—there is, in reality, only one construction that can be called a tower, the bastion at the northern end of the low wall. A separate wall surrounds the area in front of the low wall, at a distance of about ; most of the foundations of this wall have disappeared. It had a V-shape, with a dike and a ditch. In all, the defensive works evidence careful planning, architectural mastery, and a good sense of how best to exploit natural features. In addition to being a well-protected fort, its high ground also offers far-reaching control over the surrounding area—from the heights of Mudawwar, one can survey an area with a radius of about . The defensive structures also include four excellently-preserved dams in the largest ravines. The dams are between thick, and up to high. That they are dams and not walls is proven by their position, as well as their construction: on the uphill side, they are covered by a layer of mortar whose density indicates it was a water barrier. The reservoirs that would have been filled up during the rains do not appear to have supported agriculture: there are no irrigation channels. Still, some hydrological works may have existed, evidenced by shards possibly from the buckets of a noria. The combined evidence of walls and dams and possibly associated constructions indicate the massif became a fortress that could have withstood a siege lasting a few months, depending on the season. =Other structures= Aerial view of houses on the heights of Jebel Mudawwar Sketches of some of the houses Besides the walls and dams there are a number of other man-made structures, most of them on the plateaus and on the north or west side of steep peaks. Most of the 27 structures are spaced out from each other. Six of them are so ruined that their purpose cannot be established, though it is possible one of them was a musalla. Fifteen of the remaining buildings are quite similar (a uniformity or standardization that also signals a hierarchy and organization of spaces), and consist of a central, open space surrounded by separate rooms that open to the central space but not each other. Without archeological digs, the purpose of these buildings cannot be established. Their organization, with a central space that dominates the other, surrounding rooms and is the only space in the structure that opens to the outside, resembles medieval Islamic architecture of both rural and urban areas. A tentative assessment is that most of the buildings on the plateaus were houses, built during a short space of time, possibly a large governmental campaign. Six of the buildings are different. One of the two on the southernmost plateau consists of two adjoining structures as well as a space for animals, and had a latrine (made possible by its placement on the edge of the plateau). The only other building on the plateau was made of crude bricks (as opposed to rubble from limestone); it may have served as the dwelling for higher-ranked people. Its layout was quite different from all the other buildings, having a series of three rooms that were accessible from each other, rather than from the central space, in a style of architecture rarely found in the east but often in the west, particularly in the Iraq of the Abbasid Caliphate. The buildings in their layout, construction, and spacing, suggest an elite occupied that part of the massif; the plateau itself already has characteristics that set it apart from the others: higher than the others, it offers a view of the defensive works (the low wall), the other structures in the area, the oasis of Tafilalt, and the peak of the Tizi/Mkhazni. Also indicative of a special status are the remains of access routes, including steps in steep rock, that provide direct access to the plateau from the lower area, and to another plateau. The combination of a set of dwellings whose variety indicates social hierarchy suggests Jebel Mudawwar was not just a defensive works, but also an important habitation. =Date of occupation= Archeologist Chloé Capel argues that the site should be dated to the early medieval time of the caravan routes, 11th–12th century. Its defensive structures and buildings date from the time when Sijilmasa and its surrounding area were incorporated into the Almoravid dynasty, whose representatives likely ordered the construction, as evidenced by the standardized floor plans. The remains of pottery found at Jebel Mudawwar also compare to contemporary pottery found at Sijilmasa. A garrison would have been installed in the massif; for a while, Sijilmasa was the only place where the empire's gold coins were minted. The fortress also protected the trade route coming in from the south. History The lower wall, with ramp built for the set of The Mummy Jebel Mudawwar may have been the Tasagdalt mentioned by one of the amirs of the Banu Midrar dynasty, Muhammed Ibn al-Fath, who fled from Sijilmasa to \\"Tasagdalt, a stone fortress some twelve miles from Sijilmasa\\". It was studied by Moroccan sociologist Paul Pascon, who wrote a brief note on it in the Moroccan journal Hespéris in 1956, and published a monograph, La Gara Medouar, that same year. Pascon first visited the site in 1952 when he spent a few hours at the location, long enough to allow him to write up a description in which he listed a defensive wall, four towers, four dams, and various other constructions; he considered the place a stronghold. Local oral tradition held that the place had been used centuries ago by Portuguese slavers, who had used the place as a warehouse. In 2011, an extensive study was done by MAPS (Moroccan–American Project at Sijilmasa) member Chloé Capel. Its contemporary role as a tourist destination began with a film: the location was opened up for cinema, off-roading, and tourism because of the 1999 film The Mummy. The site itself was opened up because the crew built a concrete ramp through a breach in the low wall, in the southwest opening of the formation, and one of the film's central locations was built inside. In 1999, remains of plaster indicated where film sets had been constructed, and the area was littered with plastic bottles. It has been used in other films as well, including as the setting for the headquarters of SPECTRE in the James Bond film Spectre (2015). These activities have hampered recent archeological investigations: inside the wall the construction and then removal of the Mummy film set disrupted the area; outside the wall no excavations were done because of extensive disruption by the military, the film industry, and tourism, especially that associated with off-roading.

Justice Washington asked, \\"The Constitution of Georgia does not expressly interdict the passing of an act of attainder and confiscation by the authority of the legislature. Is such an act, then, so repugnant to any constitutional regulation as to be excepted from the legislative jurisdiction by a necessary implication?\\" Justice Chase agreed with him, \\"Before the plaintiff in error could claim the benefit of a trial by jury under the Constitution, it was at least incumbent upon him to show that the offense charged was committed in some county of Georgia, in which case alone the Constitution provides for the trial.\\" Justice Paterson stated that \\"to authorize this Court to pronounce any law void, it must be a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution, not a doubtful and argumentative implication.\\" Justice Cushing stated, \\"The right to confiscate and banish in the case of an offending citizen must belong to every government.

Since its initial launch, Riding Hero has been met with a mixed reception from both critics and reviewers alike who felt divided in regards to various aspects such as the visuals, sound design, controls and gameplay, though some regarded the single- player role-playing game mode as a novel concept and the multiplayer offering was noted to be one of the game's positive points. Its multiplayer LAN support would later be re-used in other titles for Neo Geo.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Riding Hero is a racing game that uses a behind-the-motorcycle perspective similar to Super Hang-On and Suzuka 8 Hours featuring a grand prix mode, a role-playing single-player campaign mode reminiscent of Final Lap Twin, as well as a multiplayer mode like most other racing titles released in the era.Riding Hero user's manual (Neo Geo AES, US) In the grand prix mode, players compete against AI-controlled racers on a worldwide grand prix tour in order to become the champion, while up to two human players can compete on versus matches in the multiplayer mode by connecting two Neo Geo systems via LAN. Every race in the game is timed and if the players fails regain time by completing a lap, the game is over unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. If a memory card is present, players are allowed to save their progress during the single-player campaign at the protagonist's home and resume the last point the game was saved at. In the role-playing single-player mode, players assume the role of an aspiring motorcycle racer on a quest to enter the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race. Players travel over the map, meeting locals and facing small-time racers in order to earn money that can be spent on purchasing new bikes and upgrade their current bike, until enough money is collected to enter the endurance race and face the champion Diamond Dave. Both the grand prix and role-playing modes give a set number of turbo boosts to the players before each race that can be used to gain higher speeds and outrun opponents.  Development and release  Riding Hero was initially first launched for arcades on July 24, 1990, becoming the first title in the Neo Geo library that featured \\"Multi Play\\" (Multi-Link) support that allowed two systems to be connected via a phone jack port integrated into each cartridge for LAN play. The game was then released for Neo Geo AES on July 1, 1991 and retained the LAN support for versus play. The title was later re-released for the Neo Geo CD on May 26, 1995, with minimal changes compared to the original MVS and AES versions minus the multiplayer mode. It has received a re-release in recent years on various digital distribution platforms such as the PlayStation Network, Nintendo eShop and Xbox Live by HAMSTER Corporation.  Reception  Riding Hero was received with a mostly mixed reception from critics and reviewers since its original release.  Legacy  Although Riding Hero never received a sequel or a spiritual successor of sorts, its LAN play feature would be re-used in SNK's own League Bowling and Alpha Denshi's Thrash Rally, the first of which allowed up to four or eight people for multiplayer.

Lion's Den traces the roots of leftist criticism of Israel by studying eight influential leftist intellectuals: Hannah Arendt, Arthur Koestler, Maxime Rodinson, Isaac Deutscher, Albert Memmi, Fred Halliday; I. F. Stone and Noam Chomsky. Of the eight, Memmi and Halliday supported Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state. Linfield writes that \\"Only in the case of Israel is the eradication of an extant nation… considered a progressive demand.” Synopsis Anti-Israel leftism, in Linfield's narrative, began in the late 1950s when leftists who had lost faith in the Soviet Union began to equate anticolonialism with socialism, in the phrasing of Albert Memmi who opposed the equation. British political theorist Alan Johnson endorses Linfield's view that the left never recovered from this false equation. To illustrate her point that the left was wrong in its assessment of Arab political attitudes, Linfield cites a 1958 article in the New Reasoner by British Marxist Harry Hanson about Arab nationalism, \\"Despite its . . . exaggerated xenophobia, its apparent resemblance, in certain of its aspects, to Fascism or Nazism, and—most serious of all its vitriolic hatred of Israel—it is fundamentally and essentially a progressive movement.\\" Linfield argues that the notion that xenophobic, antisemitic Arab nationalism was definitionally progressive because it was anti-imperialist was accepted as doctrine by progressive Western leftists, merging with an idea held by Marx himself that Jewish peoplehood must dissolve into progressive universalism. The innovation of the 1950s was that Israel should be destroyed. The Tunisian Jewish leftist Alfred Memmi who was asked by Tunisian authorities to leave the country when it won independence, described the Left's equation of anti- imperialism with socialism that had become “intrinsic to Left politics,\\" as a spurious universalism and a “betrayal of the Jews.” For Linfield the ideas driven by Arendt, Koestler, Rodinson, Stone, and Chomsky have had two bad consequensces. The first is the leftist romance with even the most reactionary, fascistic and illiberal forms of anti-imperialism produces a “calamitous obliviousness” to reality, accompanied by a “treacherous readiness to substitute ideology, wishful thinking, or sheer fantasy” for it. As an example of this, Linfield discusses Maxime Rodinson's framing of Zionism as a sin to which Arab Jew-hatred and terrorism, and offensive wars were a justified reaction. Linfield states the second negative consequence of leftist support for reactionary anti-imperialism is that the left has forsaken its own foundational values; where leftists long argued that disputes between competing national claims should be resolved by rational negotiations designed to accommodate aspirations of all peoples through consistent democracy, they now support the denial of the national claims of only one nation: the Jewish nation. Reviewing the book for the New York Times, J.J. Goldberg, wrote that Noam Chomsky and the British journalist Fred Halliday seemed \\"quite out of place here\\" because they were members of a different generation than the books earlier thinkers, while, > “ \\"The six overlapping profiles, on the other hand, tell such an intriguing > story that the book’s marginal oddities fade in importance. Here they are: > the German-born political philosopher Hannah Arendt; the mercurial, > Hungarian-born novelist and adventurer Arthur Koestler; the great biographer > and Trotsky admirer Isaac Deutscher; the combative American journalist I. F. > Stone; the French Arabist journalist Maxime Rodinson; and the Tunisian- > French anticolonialist philosopher Albert Memmi. All six lived through, > wrote about and were shaped by the cataclysmic events of the mid-20th > century: the rise of fascism, the Moscow show trials, World War II and the > Holocaust, Israel’s independence and, significantly, the 1967 Six-Day War. > All considered themselves socialists, some episodically, most as a lifelong > identifier. All six were Jewish. All wrote urgently and at length about the > Jewish history that was unfolding before their eyes. All wrote about the > place of the Jew in the modern world, some dismissively, most with sympathy, > all beneath the shadow of the Nazi genocide that was engulfing Europe and > their own families. The six were all independent, unconventional thinkers > who often found themselves alone and at odds with their own peers and > allies. All produced ideas and phrases that have entered our moral > vocabulary, most notably Arendt’s 'banality of evil.'\\" Fred Halliday, the only non-Jew of the eight intellectuals Linfield focuses on, broke with the leftist consensus and supports Israel's right to exist. An expert on Iranian politics, Halliday has asked why his fellow leftists support the “revanchist demand” that Israel should be eliminated, why Arafat was praised for rejecting a peace deal, and why Hamas is allegedly preferred to the Palestinian Authority. Albert Memmi regarded leftist criticism of Israel as “so extensive and recurrent” that “they were intrinsic to left politics rather than random aberrations.” Reception David Mikics calls Lion's Den \\"compulsively readable and nearly always persuasive.\\" Critic J. J. Goldberg concludes that the thinkers profiled by Linfield, \\"precisely anticipate the tension today’s Jewish liberals experience trying to reconcile their own pro- Israel particularism and their social-justice universalism. Linfield could not have foreseen, even a year ago as she was writing, the current predicament of Democrats caught between support of Israel and sympathy for the Palestinians, or — dare we say it? — between the affections of America’s well-established Jewish community and fast-rising Muslim community. Unexpectedly, her book appears just as its stories and lessons become urgent. Journalist Robert Scheer criticized the book, writing that its targets \\"are all attacked for daring to raise questions\\" about Israeli policy, especially toward the Palestinians. Noam Chomsky told Scheer the book is an \\"extraordinary collection of lies and deceit.\\" References External links * The Lions' Den at Yale University Press Category:2019 non-fiction books Category:Books about antisemitism Category:Anti-Zionism Category:Yale University Press books Category:Books about Zionism ","title":"The Lions' Den"},{"id":"61176208","text":"American Samoa competed at the 2019 Pacific Games in Apia, Samoa from 7 to 20 July 2019.

As a militia unit it was under command of the Kharkov Military District and designated as the Voroshilovgrad Militia Division, although it was unofficially known as the 395th before it was converted. It took part in the fighting near Rostov-on-Don during the winter of 1941–42 in the 18th Army, and retreated with that Army into the northern Caucasus mountains in the face of the German summer offensive, fighting under the command of the 18th and 12th Armies, then in the 56th Army in October. As the Axis forces retreated from the Caucasus in early 1943 it was sent to the 46th and later to the 37th Army of North Caucasus Front. During the battles that cleared the German forces from the Taman peninsula from August to October the 395th was back in 56th Army and was awarded a battle honor for its part in the campaign. By the end of 1943 it had returned to 18th Army, now under 1st Ukrainian Front near Kiev. In January, 1944 the division was decorated with both the Order of the Red Banner and the Order of Suvorov. With its Front it advanced through western Ukraine, Poland and eastern Germany, finally taking part in the Lower Silesian, Berlin, and Prague offensives in early 1945 as part of 13th Army. Voroshilovgrad Militia Division This unit formed in July, 1941 in the Voroshilovgrad oblast from volunteer workers' battalions. The city and its surrounding areas mobilized 148,000 men into the militia in July - August, forming three divisions, 30 regiments and 59 separate battalions. Most of this manpower went into the Red Army as individual replacements but by the end of August one division was transferred to Kharkov Military District control, where it was unofficially redesignated as the 395th Rifle Division as early as September 1.Charles C.

Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 78 Its order of battle, based on the first wartime shtat (table of organization and equipment) for rifle divisions, was as follows: * 714th Rifle Regiment * 723rd Rifle Regiment * 726th Rifle Regiment * 968th Artillery Regiment * 692nd Antiaircraft BattalionSharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 109.

Anatolii Yosifovich Petrakovskii, was not appointed until April 1, 1942. By October 11, 1941, the second formation of the 18th Army had been destroyed in the Battle of the Sea of Azov. The 395th became part of its third formation, moving into Southern Front by October 18.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 109 =Battle of Rostov= In the subsequent Battle of Rostov both the Soviet and German forces moved simultaneously on November 17. The right-flank divisions of 18th Army covered against a German drive on Voroshilovgrad while those on the left flank, including the 395th, failed to gain any success; the remainder of the battle would primarily involve the 9th, 37th and 56th Armies on the Soviet side.John Erickson, The Road to Stalingrad, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, UK, 1983, pp. 264-66 Following the German retreat to the Mius River the division moved up to that line with its Army and remained there through the winter and spring. Battle of the Caucasus When the German summer offensive began in late June, the division was still in 18th Army of Southern Front. The attack on the southern sector began on July 7, and the 395th was in the northern half of its Front's sector, in the first echelon along the east bank of the Mius, alongside the 383rd and 353rd Rifle Divisions, with only one division and the 64th Tank Brigade in reserve. The weight of the attack by German Army Group A soon forced Southern Front into a precarious retreat. On July 21 Colonel Petrakovskii was promoted to the rank of major general. The next day the LVII Panzer Corps encircled Rostov's outer defenses. By this time 18th Army had withdrawn most of its forces out of the city and across the Don River, leaving just two regiments of the 395th in Rostov despite orders from the Front to defend it beside the 56th Army. The panzer troops were poorly equipped to secure the heavily fortified city, which did not fall until July 27, by which time most of the personnel of the two regiments had managed to escape southwards.David M. Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 112, 177, 202-03, 539 While the battle for Rostov raged, Army Group A began advancing into the Caucasus region on July 25. At this time 18th Army was defending a 50 km sector from the Kagalnik at the mouth of the Don eastward to Kiziterinka, 20 km southeast of Rostov. By August 1 the division and its Army had come under the command of the North Caucasus Front.Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, pp. 401, 414 Later that month it was briefly reassigned to 12th Army, but when that Army was disbanded it returned to the control of 18th Army, which was now part of the Black Sea Group of Forces under Transcaucasus Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, pp. 173, 196 On September 4 General Petrakovskii handed his command over to Col. Sabir Umar-Ogly Rakhimov, who had previously been the deputy commander of the 353rd Division. The German 17th Army launched its Operation Attika on September 23 with the objective of reaching Tuapse on the Black Sea coast and encircling most of 18th Army in the process. At this time the 395th was on the far left (north) flank of its Army in the area of Fanagoriiskoe, protected by defenses that had been built in depth over the preceding weeks. The LVII Panzer Corps assaulted the division's forward defenses with its 198th Infantry Division, supported by tanks of the Slovak Motorized Division, on September 23 and 24, but made only limited gains. The attack was expanded on the 25th, committing more of the Slovak Division and also hitting the positions of the 30th Rifle Division, but the result was similar. Despite these defensive successes, on October 2 the STAVKA ordered two regiments of the 408th Rifle Division into the sector as reinforcements.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 561, 564-65, 568 After regrouping and rest, the German 17th Army resumed its offensive on October 14. The 125th Infantry Division had been shifted to the 198th's sector and advanced southwest from the region east of Fanagoriiskoe. According to German sources this assault \\"completely wiped out\\" the 714th and 726th Regiments. On the 17th the 198th Infantry penetrated southward about 8 km; on the same day the new commander of the Black Sea Group, Maj. Gen. I. E. Petrov, visited the retreating troops of 18th Army and after learning of defective communications and tactics relieved Maj. Gen. F. V. Kamkov of his command. The German advance resumed on October 19 and the 395th lost Mount Kochkanova to the 198th Infantry. By this time the division, along with the 32nd Guards Rife Division, was in danger of being encircled and was ordered to withdraw the next day. As of November 1 it had been reassigned to the 56th Army.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 569-72, 606 Into Ukraine During December the 395th was largely rebuilt with assets of the 11th NKVD Rifle Division,Glantz, Operation Don's Main Attack, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2018, p. 26 which was removed from Red Army control in the same month.Sharp, \\"Red Death\\", Soviet Mountain, Naval, NKVD, and Allied Divisions and Brigades 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. VII, Nafziger, 1995, p. 79 As the Axis forces retreated from the Caucasus in January, 1943 the division was sent to the 46th Army and then in March to the 37th Army, now in North Caucasus Front. On March 19 Colonel Rakhimov was promoted to the rank of major general and on April 9 he handed his command to Maj. Gen. Adam Petrovich Turchinskii. During the final battles against the German forces in the Taman peninsula from August to October the division was under command of the 22nd Rifle Corps of the 56th Army and in September was awarded the battle honor \\"Taman\\" for its efforts.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 109 On October 18 General Turchinskii was moved to command of the 2nd Guards Rifle Division, and was replaced by Col. Aleksandr Vasilevich Vorozhishchev. By the start of November the 395th, still in 22nd Corps, had returned to 18th Army, which was moved north to the Kiev area to join the 1st Ukrainian Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 283, 306 The division would remain under this Front for the duration of the war. Beginning on December 5 the German XXXXVIII Panzer Corps launched a counteroffensive against the Front's forces advancing west of Kiev, retaking Zhitomir and threatening to encircle the 60th Army. The 18th and 1st Tank Armies moved to the area as fast as conditions allowed and forced the panzers over to the defensive on December 21 before going over to the attack themselves three days later.Earl F. Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, Center of Military History United States Army, Washington, DC, 1968, pp. 189, 218-19 The division distinguished itself in this fighting; on January 1, 1944 it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner and on January 6 it was further awarded the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Degree. In preparation for the Proskurov-Chernovtsy Operation in early March, 1st Ukrainian Front carried out a significant regrouping during which the 395th was reassigned to the 107th Rifle Corps of 1st Guards Army. In April it was moved again, now to the 18th Guards Rifle Corps of 38th Army. On June 3 Colonel Vorozhishchev was promoted to major general. In August the division was withdrawn to the Front reserves in 74th Rifle Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 103, 134, 259 General Vorozhishchev handed his command to Col. Ivan Afanasevich Fomin on September 2. On September 5 the 395th was assigned, with 74th Corps, to 13th Army, and it spent the rest of the war in that Army.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 109 Into Germany Colonel Fomin was replaced in command by Maj. Gen. Pavel Fedoseevich Ilinykh on October 2, who was in turn replaced by Col. Fyodor Aleksandrovich Afanasev on the first day of the new year. At this time the 395th was a separate division in 13th Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, p. 19. This source lists the 355th Rifle Division, but at this time the 355th was in the 2nd Red Banner Army of the Far Eastern Front. By the beginning of February the division had been subordinated to the 24th Rifle Corps,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, p. 53 where it would remain for the duration. By the end of the advance though Poland 13th Army had reached the Oder River along the entire front from Keben to Malcz, forced the river with the assistance of 4th Tank Army and captured a bridgehead west of Keben and Steinau up to 16 km deep and 30 km wide, as well as a smaller one on the left flank. As of January 28 the 24th Corps was in the Army's second echelon on the east bank of the Oder northeast of Wolau.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, ed. and trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, pp. 343-44 1st Ukrainian Front carried out a substantial regrouping from January 29 to February 7 during which the total frontage held by 13th Army was reduced from 86 km to just 18 km. 24th Corps, consisting of the 395th, 350th and 147th Rifle Divisions, was in the first echelon with the 102nd Rifle Corps. All six divisions of the two corps were in first echelon with two rifle regiments up and one in reserve, and their sectors averaged 3 km in width. The offensive began at 0930 hours on February 8, following a 50-minute artillery preparation. 102nd Corps quickly crushed the first German position and advanced up to 8 km by day's end. 24th Corps, on the other hand, faced two heavily fortified villages on its right flank and a large woods stretching well to the west. The attacks on the villages were stymied, even with the backing of the 61st Tank Brigade. However the Corps' left flank division took advantage of the success of 52nd Army's attack to its left, advanced 4 km and reached Oberau. Jointly these advances put the two Armies in good position to outflank and possibly encircle the Hermann Göring Panzer Division, which was defending the large woods.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, pp. 382-83, 402-04 On February 9 the 24th Corps advanced up to 15 km, reaching Kotzenau with part of its forces while the remainder deployed facing north, blocking passage to the south by the now-surrounded German panzer troops. The next day the main body of 13th Army advanced in the wake of 4th Tank Army, with the objective of forcing the Bober River. On the 11th the Front's shock group faced stiffening German resistance while 24th Corps spent the entire day fighting with rearguards which were covering the main forces' retreat to the Bober. By the end of the day the main shock group had advanced up to 60 km and had expanded the width of the breakthrough to 160 km, reaching the Bober along a number of sectors. The Corps spent most of February 12 and 13 battling for the town of Sprottau before reaching the Bober in the Sagan area, encountering powerful resistance from German infantry and armor in the eastern part of the town while also forcing a crossing of the river to its north.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, pp. 406, 410-13, 416 For their roles in this fighting, on April 5 the 726th Rifle Regiment would be awarded the Order of Aleksandr Nevski, and the 714th and 732rd Regiments would each receive the Order of the Red Star. Infantry and up to 20 tanks of the Großdeutschland Panzer Corps attacked the bridgehead north of Sagan on February 14. This was countered with the assistance of the 63rd Tank Brigade of 10th Tank Corps and the German force went over to the defensive. Over the next two days the 24th Corps fought to secure Sagan, finally forcing a crossing of the Bober in the center of the town on the 16th, and then cleared its western sector. This success threatened to outflank Großdeutschland and allowed 27th Rifle Corps to expand the main bridgehead. By February 19 the final attempts of the German forces to hold along the Bober crumbled, and what remained of them began retreating to the Neisse River. By February 24 the 13th Army had closed up to the line of that river, and soon went over to the defensive.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, pp. 417, 438-39 =Berlin Strategic Offensive= As of April 1 the 395th and 350th Divisions made up 24th Corps,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, p. 123 but before the Berlin Operation began the 350th was detached to direct Front command and the 121st Guards Rifle Division took its place. On April 13, in a final change in command, Col. Aleksei Nikolaievich Korusevich took over the division from Colonel Afanasev. At this time the strength of 13th Army's rifle divisions varied from 4,700 to 5,700 men each. The Army was deployed on the east bank of the Neisse on a 10 km front from Klein Bademeusel to just outside Gross Saerchen, with the 27th and 102nd Corps in first echelon and the 24th in second. The offensive on 1st Ukrainian Front's sector began at dawn on April 16 with attacks across the Neisse and from a bridgehead that had been forced across the river south of Forst in February and made immediate progress. By about April 20 the 121st Guards was shifted to 27th Corps and the 395th was pulled back to the Army's second echelon. On the 23rd it concentrated in Luckau, with its new Corps- mate, the 117th Guards Rifle Division in the Finsterwalde area.Soviet General Staff, The Berlin Operation 1945, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, Kindle ed., ch. 11, 16 By the morning of April 26 the division had occupied the line Golssen to Baruth with its front facing east, as the encircled German 9th Army attempted to break out to the west; the 117th Guards had organized a circular defense at Luckenwalde while the 280th Rifle Division, which had now joined 24th Corps, remained in reserve. Overnight on April 25/26 the encircled forces formed a powerful group in the area of Halbe, including more than 50 tanks, and attacked west at 0800 hours at the boundary of the 3rd Guards and 28th Armies. The force broke through and reached the northern outskirts of Baruth but the 395th beat off all attempts to take the town. The German group took up positions in the woods north of Baruth and put up fierce resistance on April 27, including hand-to-hand fighting and persistent breakout attempts but over the course of the day the joint actions of the division and a corps of the 28th Army were able to eliminate all but a few remnants. In total, 6,200 prisoners, 47 tanks, 25 armored personnel carriers, 180 guns and mortars and 1,133 motor vehicles were captured. The division remained on the same line the next day as the 9th Army pocket shrank to 10 km north to south and 14 km east to west.Soviet General Staff, The Berlin Operation 1945, Kindle ed., ch. 19 On April 30, facing further attempts of the 9th Army to escape to the west, the command of 13th Army pulled the division from the line it had held and redeployed it along the front from Munchendorf to Neuhof, with the objective of attacking into Sperenberg to cut off German forces which had broken through to this area. The 117th Guards received similar orders. Despite heavy losses the German force attacked furiously along the line from Sperenberg to Kummersdorf in an effort to reach their 12th Army attacking from the west. Units of the 117th Guards and the 71st Mechanized Brigade were dislodged and the force advanced another 10 km to the Woltersdorf area before being halted by the remainder of the 117th, while the 395th's attack towards Spremberg was halted by stubborn resistance. Overnight the leading elements of the encircled group reached to within 3 – 4 km of 12th Army, but during May 1 most of the remnants were rounded up. On the same day the 1st Ukrainian Front received orders to prepare for a new advance on Prague, and the division ended the war advancing on that city.Soviet General Staff, The Berlin Operation 1945, Kindle ed., ch. 19 Postwar The officers and personnel of the division ended the war with the full title 395th Rifle, Taman, Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov Division.

Real estate development  In 1969, Brooks- Scanlon created a subsidiary corporation called Brooks Resources. The new company was created to develop Brooks-Scanlon property for uses other than timber production. The first project undertaken by Brooks Resources was the development Black Butte Ranch, begun in 1970. Black Butte Ranch is located just off U. S.

That project was followed by the Mount Bachelor Village resort in 1974. However, when the international oil crisis drove up fuel prices in the mid-1970s, recreational travel became very expensive. As a result, Brooks Resources offered everyone who had purchased property at Mount Bachelor Village the opportunity to cancel their purchase contracts. Every buyer but one took advantage of the cancellation offer. Once oil prices stabilized, property sales at Mount Bachelor Village picked up again and the project was completed as planned.McLaughlin, Kathleen, \\"Brooks Resources Sells Mount Bachelor Village Resort\\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 10 July 2018.\\"Mount Bachelor Village,\\" Building Community Since 1969, Brooks Resources Corporation, Bend, Oregon, 2019, p.11.

In addition, Black Butte Ranch and Mount Bachelor Village remained profitable during that period. Nevertheless, Brooks Resources lost money on its operations. In 1982 alone, the company lost $8.7 million, reducing the company's equity by approximately one third.\\"Brooks Resources Posts $8.7 million Loss in ‘82\\", Corvallis Gazette-Times, Corvallis, Oregon, 23 April 1983, p. 11.

Starting in the early 1990s, Brooks Resources' equity began growing ten percent a year. This was helped by projects like the Awbrey Glen golf community begun in 1993 and Shevlin RiverFront, a 1996 project. The Mount Bachelor Village conference center was built in 1999 and Century Washington Center was developed in 2000.

It is simple to swap two non-overlapping regions of an array of equal size.

Three algorithms are known to accomplish this: Bentley's Juggling, Gries-Mills, and Reversal.Jon Bentley, \\"Programming Pearls\\", pp. 13–15, 209-211. All three algorithms are linear time O(n), (see Time complexity). Reversal algorithm The reversal algorithm is the simplest to explain, using rotations. A rotation is an in-place reversal of array elements. This method swaps two elements of an array from outside in within a range.

Its primary use is to be as the home of the Palm Springs AHL team of the American Hockey League (AHL). History On June 26, 2019, it was reported that the ownership of the upcoming Seattle Kraken had chosen Palm Springs as the site for Seattle's AHL affiliate and that the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians and Oak View Group (OVG) had teamed up to build an arena on band-owned land as a home for their proposed expansion team. The 10,000 seat arena was estimated to cost $250 million. OVG CEO Tim Leiweke used a study done by the SoCal Coyotes on the future of sports events and tourism in the Coachella Valley as proof of the viability of a multi-purpose venue in Palm Springs. The proposed arena was to be constructed on part of the Spa Resort Casino's parking lots and be owned by the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians with the Oak View Group as the arena operator. It would also have had an adjoining facility to serve as a year-round community gathering space as well as the training center for the AHL team. Groundbreaking and construction on the arena was expected to begin in February 2020, with completion by fall 2021, but was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting ban on large gatherings including concerts and sporting events. By September 2020, OVG's negotiations with the tribe had come to a halt and the agreement was ended. On September 16, 2020, the Oak View Group and H.N. and Frances C. Berger Foundation announced they had chosen a new location for the arena in the middle of the Coachella Valley near Palm Desert, but it would not open until at least 2022. The arena will be located on land in between Interstate 10 and the Classic Club golf course.

During the turn of the century, the station had streetcars running to Inhaúma, though these have since been abandoned in favour of buses. With the growth of the city of Rio de Janeiro - In large part caused by the existence of the train line - passenger trains started to run with ever increasing frequency, and the line would be electrified in 1937. Méier Station would also get new entrances during these electrification works, which meant that passengers no longer had to walk on the tracks to access the station.

Background Fashion photography began with engravings reproduced from photographs of Leopold-Emile Reutlinger, Nadar and others in the 1890s. After high-quality half-tone reproduction of photographs became possible, most credit as pioneers of the genre goes to the French Baron Adolph de Meyer and the Luxembourgian Edward Steichen who, borrowing his friend’s hand-camera in 1907, candidly photographed dazzlingly-dressed ladies at the Longchamp Racecourse and who by 1911 had been assigned by the French magazine Art et Décoration to produce pictures of dresses by the Parisian designer Paul Poiret, competing with the drawings and pochoir prints earlier, and contemporaneously, used for fashion plates. The Séebergers Group portrait of Henri, Jules et Louis Séeberger, about 1900* © Séeberger frères A family devoted to the genre was the Séeberger dynasty over two generations. Three brothers Jules (1872–1932), Louis (1874-1946) and Henri (1876-1956) were born to Jean-Baptiste, a Bavarian tradesman who had migrated to France in 1870, and their mother Louise, a widow from Lyon with a daughter Félicie. The second generation, sons of Louis, brothers Jean (1910-1979) and Albert (1914-1999) also inherited a love of photography. Together, their work spans most of the twentieth century and was devoted to elegance and fashion. The brothers went to Paris for secondary education at the Lycée Rollin where Louis was awarded first prize for drawing. They completed their schooling at the municipal art school Palissy, before Jules and Louis start their training as designers of fabric at the atelier of J. Souchon, a specialist in “high innovations, gowns, ribbons, damask linens, Jacqaurd fabrics and drafting.” From thence came an interest, and much inside knowledge of, fashion. While the three brothers worked as fabric designers, it was in 1891 that Jules started in evening drawing classes and also picked up photography. After a move to 39 rue Lafayette in the 10th Arr., Louis won the Danton Jeune prize dedicated to a disadvantaged child at the Ville de Paris art school, while Jules won a travel grant to Normandy. In the meantime, the youngest, Henri, enrolled at a school for applied art and also won prizes. After the death of their father in 1894 the family moved to the quieter 13 rue Fénelon. In 1899 Jules submitted photographs to various contests, an interest soon shared by his brothers, winning prizes in amateur competitions organised by the newspaper Lectures Pour Tous. He experimented with bromoil, especially the Rawlins process. Jules took documentary photography awards in 1903 and 1904 for pictures he made on the Seine riverbanks and in Montmartre. Images by the three brothers, who signed their initials (JHLS) were exhibited and published in various journals and as postcards by the Kunzli brothers and Leopold Verger.

Jules Séeberger (1898) The Montmartre Water Carrier Supported by their mother, their older sister and Louis’ wife Anna, the three brothers established a family business in 1909 under the name 'Frères Séeberger' in a studio at 33 rue de Chabrol, also in the 10th and five minutes walk from their home. Fashion photographers While magazines like Les Modes published careful portraits, most hand-coloured, of high society women in outfits designed by the renowned couturiers, the daily newspapers like Le Figaro and Le Gaulois had been running pictures in their late editions taken, like Steichen’s, of women at the racetracks,Xavier Demange, ‘Trend Setters at the Racetrack’, in Sylvie Aubenas and Xavier Demange, Elegance: the Séeberger Brothers and the Birth of Fashion Photography, San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 2007, 28-37.Rosser, E. (2010). Photographing Fashion: a critical look at The Sartorialist. Image & Narrative, 11(4), 158-170. and their approach was taken up by the magazine Femina, in an effort to satisfy the curiosity among their readership about what was fashionable in ‘real clothing’, a trend soon picked up by Paris Illustré or La Nouvelle Mode that from 1901-1902 featured snapshots taken by obscure amateurs Carle de Mazibourg or Edmond Cordonnier, though these were soon displaced by more professional images. thumbThe brothers followed the in-crowd calendar as they went to beach resorts, ski resorts, and other fashionable locations in Paris. Their quarry was photographs of lady’s fashion (and some men’s too), for which they found a ready market in La Mode Practique from May 22, 1909 onwards. Incidentally, though their focus was on dresses, shoes, bags, hats, furs, and feathers, they also captured imagery of a truly haute couture, a ‘high society’ normally inaccessible to those of their class, who, though conscious at all times of the camera and allowing themselves to be photographed, would only acknowledge those belonging to the great studios and certainly not the Séebergers. From their imagery, since it was published immediately in a long list of over 50 publications, fashion historians are able to track the influence on style of the great designers Chanel, Paul Poiret, Jeanne Lanvin, Elsa Schiaparelli, Jean Patou, Robert Piguet, Madeleine Vionnet, Lucien Lelong, Paquin et al., of whom the Séebergers also made portraits. Not all of their subjects were of the higher classes. The great houses of Poiret, Lanvin, Worth or Patou hired models for their slim figures and tutored poses who would troop together ready to be seen and photographed. Lesser, or newer, couturiers hired casuals by the hour and often dressed them in their most eccentric costumes to attract attention, while some wore the insignia of the designers on their backs like sandwich-board bearers while they circulated alone. Milliners did not shy from wearing their own creations. The ‘fashionables’ were another class of model; well-known personalities known as ‘amphibians’, ‘jockeys’ or ‘society consultants’ who, while their celebrity lasted, wore the great designers latest creations sold to them at huge discounts or loaned free.  Style and technique  The Séeberger’s photography involved knowing these models, keeping up with the latest trends likely to appeal to the publications and an exhausting hunt for the right models amongst the crowds of fashionable racegoers—all the more so when the ‘portable’ cameras, up until around 1935 when Henri adopted the Rolleiflex, were the huge folding Ernemann Klapp Nettel or more cumbersome Thornton Pickard 13 x 18 cm reflex camera, that they used at the Bois de Boulogne and in Saint Moritz.Sylvie Aubenas, ‘The Séebergers, Fashion Photographers: Rediscovering Their Place’, in Sylvie Aubenas and Xavier Demange, Elegance: the Séeberger Brothers and the Birth of Fashion Photography, San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 2007, 11-27. In each case Henri accompanied by his brother Louis directing the model, bearing a notebook to record details of the fashion, and passing dark slides. Even in 1911, despite the awkwardness of their camera, the Séebergers manage, with the assistance of professional models whom they can direct, to convey a sense of immediacy and apparent spontaneity. Séeberger frères, Bar de l'hôtel Crillon à Paris, 1925  The French image  In addition the brothers’ fashion imagery overlapped with their portrayal of media celebrities including Joséphine Baker and Charlie Chaplin. A lesser known part of their practice, as noted by Gilbert Salachas, from 1923 International Kinema Research employed the Séeberger brothers to document locations which filmmakers adapted to create the formulaic Parisian ‘atmosphere’ in sets for movies such as the 1938 American romantic comedy Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife and A comedy of murders (Charles Chaplin, 1947) or even as late as An American in Paris (Vincente Minelli, 1951), thus creating a mythic Paris that survives in cinema even today.
