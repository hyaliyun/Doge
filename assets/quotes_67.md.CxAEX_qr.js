He is a former career police officer, working in uniform and as a detective for eighteen years, before moving into senior roles at the Police National Headquarters in Wellington. As commissioner, he successfully completed rewriting the policing law, the introduction of tasers, and survived a number of controversies in the media. Broad has an LLB degree from the Victoria University of Wellington, and was admitted as a barrister and solicitor by the New Zealand Law Society. He joined the police as a cadet in 1975, and was a beat officer for two years before entering the CIB. He has certificates in Police Management from New Zealand, Canada, and the United States. In the 2011 Queen's Birthday Honours, Broad was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services as Commissioner of Police. District Commander Broad was District Commander of Auckland City Police District from 1998 to 2003. In June 1999 he surprised colleagues by revealing details of his contract, which included performance- based portion of −5 to +8 percent. Auckland Mayor Christine Fletcher was sent a suspicious letter featuring a photo of a woman wielding a pistol and containing two lumps in October 2000. Broad personally took charge of the case, and checked with the mayor if she had received any other threatening communications. The letter turned out to be a false alarm, after being x-rayed police deemed it safe to open, and discovered a theatre invitation and lollies. In December that year the Minister of Police George Hawkins told 57 Auckland police including Broad to return their cellphones, as part of a cost- cutting exercise. Police Association president Greg O'Connor, and opposition police spokesman Brian Neeson, who suggested police would next be sharing teabags, derided the move. For his work as the principal law enforcement member with Netsafe, the national multi-agency Internet safety programme, the Society for the Policing of Cyberspace (Canada) named him the 2002 inaugural winner of the International Law Enforcement Award. He managed large security operations in Auckland, including the 11th APEC meeting (requiring protection of the President of the United States), and Operation Marlin II for the 2003 America's Cup in Auckland. Broad received a six-month secondment to the Home Office Police Standards Unit in London from September 2003 to March 2004, where he studied British policing procedures and technology, including a vehicle registration plate identification system. Commissioner Minister of Police Annette King announced Broad's appointment as Commissioner of Police on 4 April 2006, succeeding acting commissioner Steve Long, and with the support of opposition politicians. The government tasked him with rewriting the Police Act 1958, which was realised on 1 October 2008 with the Policing Act 2008. He stated one of his goals as commissioner would be restoring public confidence in the police, and that youth gangs were an \\"area of opportunity\\" to prevent future crime. Broad launched the Police Electronic Crime Laboratory in Wellington on 24 September 2007, with a cellphone text message. He said \\"Crime is being increasingly committed in what is effectively the cyberspace wild west, a borderless environment where traditional policing methods are often no longer effective.\\", and stated the resource would let police better track criminals using the internet and electronic devices. For New Year 2008, the busiest night of the year for police, he joined front-line officers on the beat in Christchurch, where there were 32 arrests. Broad paid tribute to Sergeants Derek Wootton and Don Wilkinson, officers killed separately in the line of duty in 2008. He announced he would be reviewing the Arms Act, as the air rifle suspected of causing Wilkinson's death could be purchased over the counter without a licence. =Commission of Inquiry= A Commission of Inquiry into Police Conduct launched by Prime Minister Helen Clark and headed by Dame Margaret Bazley ran from 4 February 2004 to 26 March 2007, with the objective to investigate the way in which New Zealand Police had dealt with allegations of sexual assault by members of the police and associates. It investigated 313 complaints of sexual assault made between 1979 and 2005, 141 of which were serious enough to lay criminal charges. Broad unequivocally and unreservedly apologised for the damning findings of the report, saying, \\"I acknowledge the hurt and harm that has been done to you, your families and supporters. I am truly sorry that these few of our number have caused so much pain and grief that undermined that sense of high expectations New Zealanders rightly have of their police\\". He publicly committed to implementing 48 recommendations relating to the police, and assisting with the 12 relating to the Police Complaints Authority. =Anti-terror raids= A major police operation during his term was the 2007 New Zealand anti-terror raids. When police conducted the dawn raids he announced they were necessary in the interest of public safety, that those arrested on 15 October had used firearms and other weapons at the military-style training camps. He told reporters, \\"I believe this is domestically oriented. I don't have evidence there is an international connection to this.\\" Three hundred police were involved, resulting in the seizure of four guns and seventeen arrests. On 8 November, Solicitor General David Collins declined to prosecute under the Terrorism Suppression Act, citing insufficient evidence. In the aftermath Ruatoki residents wanted utu (revenge) in the form of Broad's resignation, a call echoed by the Māori Party and Global Peace and Justice Auckland. Broad spoke at a Wainuiomata Marae hui in March 2008, saying, \\"That there is hurt, I understand that, I understand how that happened and I deeply regret that.\\" A Māori Party spokesperson said the speech was \\"a good start\\". =Tasers= The New Zealand police ran two trials examining the introduction of tasers, before Broad authorised their general use on 28 August 2008. The previous day he had taken the decision to parliament seeking input  opposition politicians and the Police Association criticised him and the Labour government for diverting attention away from other political issues and needing government help to make a decision. He declined a request by a TVNZ journalist to be tasered himself. =Media incidents= The May 2007 issue of Investigate magazine revealed that in a pornographic film involving bestiality with a chicken screened at Broad's home in 1981. He acknowledged the film was shown but stated he only learnt about it afterwards and did not approve. A 2008 investigation by the Independent Police Conduct Authority cleared Broad of allegations he had \\"pulled rank\\" to avoid being breath tested in 1992. A detective inspector in Christchurch at the time, he returned a positive breath alcohol test. The traffic officer told him to leave the car and walk, standard practice at the time, according to the inquiry. He reported the incident to his superior the following morning.

It is the sequel to Ar tonelico: Melody of Elemia, taking place roughly one and a half years after that game's canonical ending. Gameplay Prerelease screenshot demonstrating the Ar tonelico II battle system in action. While several of the displays differ from the final version, it shows how different it is from the one used in the first Ar tonelico Though superficially similar to its predecessor in both aesthetics and style, Ar Tonelico II battle system is new. The new version removed the ability to jump and its platforming sections. The field exploration marks indicating points of interest, the Camp Circles (which restore health, save the game, and offer gameplay tips), and the encounter bar (which indicates how many battles can be fought in that particular area) remain the same as in the previous game. In Ar Tonelico II, the player can control up to four characters in battle, in two pairs. Battles are divided into two phases. In the Attack Phase, characters can attack until the Time Gauge expires and the Defense Phase begins. The player defends the Reyvateils against attacks by pressing buttons indicated on the screen. The better the timing, the better the guard. Player receive special power upon filling the Emotion Indicator. Plot =Setting= The setting for the game is the same as the previous game: the planet of Ar Ciel, albeit centered on a different region this time. The Tower of Ar tonelico from Metafalss is different from the tower in the first game since it does not look like a tower initially, but still has some of the same essential facilities (Plasma Bell (represented as the Lift Generators) and Musical Corridor (called here the Wings of Hynemos)). The Song Magics are still used like programs, but in this tower there are two Song Magic servers: the Sol Marta server and the Infel Phira Server. The Sol Marta server is located in the upper zone of the tower, acting like a stationary satellite. However, Sol Marta is not a proper Song Magic server, and instead, it serves as a relay for the First Tower of Ar tonelico, which was the setting for the first game. On the other hand, the Infel Phira server is located in a satellite that orbits the sky around the tower and shares its name with said server. Given Sol Marta's purpose as a relay for the First Tower, it works with the same kind of hymmnos as it and executes the EXEC variety of hymns. On the other hand, the Infel Phira server works with another kind of hymmnos called the New Testament of Pastalie hymmnos, and executes the METHOD variety of hymns. =Story= The region of surrounds the second Tower of Ar tonelico, which is said to represent the Goddess Frelia of the Trio of Elemia. Reyvateil in this region have been succumbing to a raging Reyvateil-exclusive epidemic called the Infel Phira Dependency (I.P.D.). Croix, a Knight under the Grand Bell Church of Pastalia, is sent to find the source of the problem and contain the epidemic. There is more transpiring in this region than just the epidemic, however, and one mission will throw him into an adventure to unravel the mysteries of the planet Ar Ciel and seek out a legend handed down by the people of Metafalss: the lost Hymn of Metafalica. =Characters= As with Ar tonelico, Ar tonelico II features eight playable characters and many more who are important to the story. Croix Bartel is the main protagonist, whose life is changed when a routine mission goes awry. He becomes involved with two Reyvateils named Cloche Leythal Pastalia and Luca Trulyworth. Music The Gust sound team of Akira Tsuchiya, Ken Nakagawa and Daisuke Achiwa returned from the first game to compose the music for this game, as did Haruka Shimotsuki, Takashige Inagaki and Akiko Shikata for the composition of several of the songs and Hymns. Like the soundtrack for Ar tonelico, the music of the game was released across three albums: a two-disc Original Soundtrack and two Hymnnos Concert CDs which contain all but one of the songs and Hymns that were absent from the OST. That missing song (titled \\"Emptiness\\") was later on released in one of Akiko Shikata's albums. All four singers from the first game returned to sing the songs and Hymns of this game's Reyvateils: Luca - Haruka Shimotsuki, Cloche - Akiko Shikata, Jacqli - Noriko Mitose, Reisha and Frelia - Yuuko Ishibashi. Reception The game was praised in Japan. The U.S. release was also well-received, but many fans have criticized its localization for bugs and glitches. The accuracy of some aspects of the translation is also debated, as approximately half of the Japanese voice overs were removed to make room for the English dubbing.

The event took place on July 30, 2000. The event's official name is \\"\\". A video recording of the event was released on DVD by EMI Music Japan on September 17, 2008 as part of the celebration for the 10th anniversary of Ringo Sheena's debut.  Ticket Lottery  The Kaho Theater was built in a traditional Japanese architecture style and could accommodate up to 1,000 people. Due to the high demand that exceeded its capacity, tickets for the concert were sold by lottery. The high demand for tickets resulted in many being sold at auction for a higher price. Toshiba EMI broadcast a live-stream of the performance, which was viewed by approximately 17,300 people, a new national record in Japan. Sheena invited fans who had not managed to get tickets to play extras in the filming of the PV for Yattsuke Shigoto on July 28, where band members had a dress rehearsal before the public performance. Inspired by a rock band vocalist who told his fans to \\"wear black to tomorrow's show\\" and then didn't wear black himself, Sheena asked all the guests to wear red for the day. No music was recorded during filming. The track used in the video was the recording from the performance at Shibuya Public Hall on April 15, 2000 from the \\"Gekokujou Xstasy\\" tour. Thus, at the end of the video, the beginning of another song, \\"Benkai Debussy\\", can be heard. Performance The show was a one-night performance that took place at the Kaho Theater in Iizuka in Fukuoka Prefecture. The scenic design and stage effects incorporated shoji (the traditional sliding door of translucent paper) and other Japanese-style effects. Sheena and members of the backing band, Gyakutai Glycogen, were all costumed in yukata (traditional kimonos). As part of the stage performance, Sheena crucified a mannequin dressed in the image of her bandage-like costume from her previous nationwide tour \\"Gekokujou Xstasy.\\" She also used similar Japanese themes in her later nationwide tour \\"Sugoroku Ecstasy\\" (which was recorded and released on DVD as \\"Electric Mole\\").

Avent Field, is a county-owned public-use airport located three nautical miles (6 km) west of the central business district of Bennettsville, in Marlboro County, South Carolina, United States. Although most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, this airport is assigned BBP by the FAA and BTN by the IATA.Great Circle Mapper: BTN / KBBP - Bennettsville, South Carolina (Marlboro County Jetport)  Facilities and aircraft  Marlboro County Jetport covers an area of at an elevation of 147 feet (45 m) above mean sea level.

At that time there were 13 aircraft based at this airport, all single-engine. History The airport opened on 8 October 1941 as Bennettsville Airport. Was renamed as Palmer Field in 1943 in honor of Capt. William White Palmer (1895-1934), Bennettsville native and World War I pilot. Palmer served in the 94th Aero Squadron in France during the war, shooting down three enemy aircraft.

One of the most common things tally counters are used for is counting people, animals, or things that are coming and going from some location. Description 207x207px A tally counter is usually cased in metal and is cylindrical in shape. Part of the circle is flattened out and contains a window of plastic or glass. Inside the counter are a number of rings with the numbers from 0 to 9 in descending order going clockwise. Most counters have four such rings, allowing the user to count up to 9999. A metal ring may be attached to aid in holding the counter, and usually half the ring is bent to allow it to fold flush with the counter when not in use. The counter is activated by pressing a button located above the screen. This causes the first ring to advance one number. After the count has reached 0009, then the second ring will advance one click and the first ring will come back to zero displaying 0010. To reset the counter, a knob is located on the side. This knob turns all the rings which are displaying the same number (usually zero). When the number displayed reaches the number on the remaining rings, then they will turn too, until the display is reset back to 0000. (Analog odometers in vehicles operate in a similar fashion.) Electronic tally counters are available, which use an LCD screen to display the count, and a button to advance the count. Some also have a button to decrement the count, for example if a mistake is made, or if counting a majority. A digital tally counter Uses The main application of tally counters is as people counters. At concerts, stadiums, etc., a person will stand by the door with a tally counter recording the number of people that enter. At amusement parks, the rides can only hold a certain number of people, so the operator may use a tally counter to keep track of the number of people who get on the ride. They are also used for traffic analysis, scientific research, counting inventory and on industrial lines as well. Tally counters have also been used in religion to count prayers, often replacing traditional prayer beads. Shri Vidya initiates often use them to keep track of the number of repetitions of the Mula Mantra into which they are initiated. Sikhs may use them to keep track of the number of times they chant the Mul Mantar. Buddhists have also been known to use them to count mantras. Gaudiya Vaishnava Hindus may use tally counters to keep track of the number of times that they chant the Hare Krishna Mahamantra. Initiated devotees are required to chant a certain number of 'rounds' each day, each round consisting of 108 repetitions.

He is the author of The Technics of Bel Canto (1905) and source for Vocal Wisdom: Maxims of Giovanni Battista Lamperti (1931). Life and career Portrait of Giovanni Battista Lamperti Giovanni Battista Lamperti was born in 1839 in Milan to Italian singing teacher Francesco Lamperti. He was a chorister at the great cathedral and studied voice and piano at the conservatory. A student and later accompanist for his father at the conservatory, Giovanni knew better than anyone else the method his father taught (which he claimed descended from the great castrato- teacher Antonio Bernacchi). Appropriating it for teaching his own students, Giovanni also began teaching voice at the Milan conservatory and then for 20 years in Dresden, followed by Berlin. His preferred teaching arrangement was having three or four students present at each lesson: each would get their turn while the others observed and learned thereby. He was said to be a strict, exacting instructor not given to flattery, but who enthusiastically praised his students upon exceptional achievement. Many of Giovanni’s students became international opera stars including Irene Abendroth, David Bispham, Agnes Huntington, Franz Nachbaur, , Marcella Sembrich, and Roberto Stagno. There was famously bad blood between the elder and younger Lamperti, eventually resulting in a bitter schism between the studios and followers of Francesco and Giovanni. A pupil of both Lampertis described the hostile situation thus: > Strange as it may seem, father and son never understood each other and were > never on good terms. They were both high strung, highly temperamental, and > perhaps got on each other’s nerves. At any rate, there was a jealousy > between them that was never overcome. The father said that his son was no > musician, and the son answered by saying: ‘At my father’s death he had great > fame and no money; at my death I will have a reasonable amount of fame and a > large income.” When the misunderstanding between the two became unbearable > the younger man went into the music profession for himself.Interview with > Lena Doria Devine, New York Post.

He later teamed up with his friend DJ Dig-it-all to produce his first album, Hip Hop Underworld and to start an underground record label, N.Y.U. Club. He began working as a DJ on Khao San Road around this time. Dajim claims that his pseudonym was coined by his managers at Tower Records, comparing his witty nature to comedian Jim Carrey.  Controversy  The offensive content of Dajim's songs led to his arrest in September 2001 under the controversial \\"social order\\" policies () of then-Interior Minister Purachai Piumsomboon. In particular, the song Sueak Thammai (Why bother?) () became something of an anthem for club DJs in protest of new early closure laws, who would blast the song when authorities came to shut them down for the night. As a result, sale of his two independently released albums was forbidden. He joined GMM Grammy's subsidiary label Genie Records in 2002 and released his third album, Rap Thai, that same year. When his early albums began to resurface for sale at Pantip Plaza and other locations, Dajim was arrested again in April 2002, but he claimed that this distribution was done without his consent or knowledge and was either counterfeit goods or leftover stock of the banned albums.

He is now referred to as Saint Athanasius. Thirumeni was consecrated as Metropolitan for the Angamaly diocese in 1910 by Patriarch Ignatius Abded Aloho II and became the Malankara Metropolitan of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church in 1918. He held that position until his death on 25 January 1953 at age 84.http://www.syriacchristianity.info/StAt/pdf/Susthathikon.pdf In 19 August 2004, the Patriarch beatified Thirumeni and on 18 September 2009 he was officially declared as a saint of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church. The Feast of Saint Athanasius is held annually on 26 January. Childhood Valiya Thirumeni was born in India. His English education took place at the Alwaye Government High School in Alwaye, Kerala. He was later sent to the Syrian seminary at Kottayam, under the direct care of Pulikkottil Joseph Mar Dionysious II. He completed the seminary course and simultaneously passed the matriculation exam at the CMS College Kottayam. After graduation, Valiya Thirumeni was appointed a teacher (malfono) in Thrikkunnathu seminary, teaching there until 1895. Later the diocesan Metropolitan Athanasius Paulose Kadavil entrusted him with supervising the construction of St. Mary's Church at Thrikkunnathu. Career On 25 November 1898, Valiya Thirumeni was ordained as a priest (Kassisso) by Gregorios Geevarghese. On 28 November, he was elevated to monk (ramban) by Gregorios Joseph and Metropolitans Dionysious V and Athanasius Paulose Kadavil.http://www.syriacchristianity.info/StAt/SthaSalm.htm In December 1917, after then-Malankara Metropolitan Kochuparambil Paulose Mor Koorilos died, Valiya Thirumeni was selected as the new Malankara Metropolitan. He took office in January 1918. On 6 May 1922, Valiya Thirumeni called a special convention of the students' organization of the Malankara Jacobite Syriac Orthodox Church at the Cheruthottukunnel St. George Church of the Angamaly diocese. Thirumeni proposed that the student organization be named after his spiritual mentor, St. Gregorios Geevarghese of Parumala. The group later came to be known as the Mar Gregorios Syrian Vidhyarthi Sangam (Mar Gregorios Syrian Students Association) and later as the Mor Gregorios Jacobite Students' Movement. Thirumeni also founded the Brotherhood of St. Antonios and the St. Mary's Sisterhood, with the aim of building a base for the monastic movement in Malankara. He also encouraged the development of a centre for theological studies at Thrikkunnathu. In 1931, Patriarch Mor Ignatius Elias III visited India to strive for peace in the Malankara Syrian church. Thirumeni accompanied Elias throughout the apostolic visit and participated in the meetings that were held with the aim of achieving a long-standing peace. However Patriarch Elias died before accomplishing his peace mission, and was entombed at the St. Ignatius Monastery, Manjinikkara. Thirumeni led the ceremony of the Patriarch's last rites. On 22 August 1935, a Malankara Association meeting was held at the St. George Jacobite Syrian Cathedral, Karingachira which unanimously re-elected Thirumeni as the Malankara Metropolitan and Metropolitan Trustee. Patriarch Mor Ignatius Aphrem I Barsoum of the Apostolic See of Antioch and All the East gave Thuramani the title \\"Defender of the True Faith\\" (Sathya Viswasa Samrakshakan) after he had served as Metropolitan of Malankara Church for 42 years. Metropolitans ordained during the tenure of Mor Athanasius Paulose After Thuramani became Mor Athanasius, the following Metropolitans were ordained to serve with him in the Malankara Church: * Mor Severious Edavazhikkal, ordained as the first metropolitan of Knanaya diocese in August 1910 by Patriarch Ignatius Abded Aloho III. * Mor Divanasios Michael for the Kottayam, Niranam, Kollam and Thumpamon diocese, ordained in 1926 by Patriarch Mor Ignatius Elias III. * Mor Awgen Thimotheos for Kandand diocese, ordained in 1926 by Patriarch Mor Ignatius Elias III. * Mor Dioscoros Thomas for Knanaya diocese, ordained in 1926 by Patriarch Mor Ignatius Elias III. Mor Dioscoros later joined the newly formed Syro-Malankara Catholic Church. Mor Awgen Thimotheos deserted the Holy Church in 1942, at a time when the church was crippled in a series of crises. Following this defection, the Patriarch appointed Mor Athanasius Paulose as the diocesan metropolitan. In 1945, due to his advancing age, Mor Athanasius requested additional help. Fr. Geevarghese Vayaliparambil and Ramban Paulose Mulayirickal were elected by the diocesan bodies of Angamali and Kochi and consecrated bishops under the names Mor Geevarghese Gregorios and Mor Severious Paulose by Patriarch Ignatius Aphrem I. Mor Gregorios served under Mor Athanasius in the Angamali diocese and Mor Severious was assigned to the Kochi diocese. In 1951 Abraham Mor Clemis was ordained to the Knanaya diocese, and in 1952, Paulose Mor Philoxenos was ordained for the diocese of Kandanad. He assumed the charge of the diocese just two weeks before the demise of Mor Athanasiu. Death Valiya Thirumeni died on 25 January 1953 at the age of 84. The next day he was buried at the northern side of the madbho (altar) of St. Mary's Church Thrikkunnathu. Memorials The Mor Athanasius College of Engineering at Kothamangalam, the Mor Athanasius High School at Nedumbassery, and the Mor Athanasius English Medium School at Puthencuriz are all named for Valiya Thirumeni. In 2006, the St. Athanasius Cathedral was founded at the church headquarters in Puthencruz. The sandalwood cot presented to Valiya Thirumeni by his uncle is kept in a separate room of the office of his home parish, the Mor Sabor Mor Aphroth Church at Akaparambu. In 2003, the 50th anniversary of Mor Athanasius' death, the Malankara Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church organized several commemoration ceremonies that continued throughout the year. The celebration of Holy Qurbono on the 50th Dhukrono of Mor Athanasius was presided over by Catholicos Aboon Mor Baselios Thomas I, assisted by all the prelates of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church Church, at the Syrian Chapel in Alwaye on 26 January 2003. Beatification Two miracles have been attributed to Valiya Thirumeni: * A woman claimed to have suffered from haemorrhage for several years despite medical treatments. She approached Valiya Thirumeni for help. He prayed for her and she was reportedly healed of the disease. * A man called Varkey claimed to have suffered from an evil spirit for 20 years. Valiya Thirumeni placed his sleeba (cross) on the man's forehead and prayed for him. The man claimed that he was immediately cured. On 18 September 2009, the Patriarch signed bull No.152/2009. It permitted the reciting of the name of St. Athanasius Paulose in the 5th Tubden. Henceforth, he name was remembered in all Malankara Jacobite Syrian churches worldwide, after the names of St. Gregorios Abdul Jaleel and St. Osthatheos Sleeba. The bull was read at the Kothamangalam Mar Thoma Church on 2 October 2009 during the 324th memorial feast of Maphryono St. Baselios Yeldho in the presence of the Catholicos, the visiting Archbishop Mor Thimotheos Mousa Al Shamani of Nineveh and the Abbot of Mor Mattai Dayro, Mosul, Iraq and all the Metropolitans of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church.

It was the last campaign of the Ukrainian armed forces in post-World War I attempt to achieve independence of Ukraine. The plan The plan of the Second Winter Campaign was bold and simple: to move into central Ukraine and unify the various partisan units therein. In late 1917, there were many independent units working in central Ukraine, including the anarchist Nestor Makhno in the central steppes. Together, the Army of the Ukrainian National Republic would then drive Bolshevik forces from Ukraine. Participating units There were three main army groups which took part in the campaign. The main group was known as the Volynhian group, and consisted of 800 men. It was under the command of general Yurii Tiutiunnyk, and the chief of staff was colonel Yurii Otmarshtain. The second group, known as the Podollian group, consisted of 400 men. It was commanded by Lt Col M. Palii and, later, Col S. Chorny. The third group, the Bessarabian group, under the command of general Andrii Huly- Hulenko, was based in Romania. The campaign The biggest challenge that the campaign faced was lack of coordination of participating units. The plan itself was very bold: to move from bases in Western Ukraine into bolshevik- held central Ukraine and unify many of the partisan units. At the time, Bolshevik units were themselves poorly coordinated. Also, many partisan bands were working throughout Ukraine independently against Bolsheviks. This was especially common in the Zaporozhia region. All three groups crossed the Soviet border in different places. The first information about the crossing of the border by Ukrainian troops was received by the command of the right-bank group of the Red Army from Kyiv at noon on October 28. At the same time, rumors spread among the population about the large number of Ukrainian forces and the beginning of a mass anti-Bolshevik uprising. Partisan detachments of atamans Khmara, Lytvynchuk, Sviatenko and Orlyk joined the Second Winter Campaign. Simultaneously with the raid groups, the insurgents of the Zabolotny atamans conducted auxiliary actions – in the area of Balta – Olgopil, Shepel - between Bratslav and Vinnytsia, Lykha - near Lipivtsi, Brovy - in the area of KremenchukВасиленко В.

The main task of the group is to demonstrate the \\"main offensive\\" in the south of Ukraine, to divert the attention of the bolsheviks. The task of the Bessarabian group was to capture the city of Tiraspol and move to Odessa to gain access to the sea, goal was not achieved. = Podillia group = The Podillia group began the campaign on October 25, 1921, and met with early success. It first engaged and destroyed a soviet cavalry regiment, and used the captured equipment to transform itself into a cavalry unit. It continued on to the village of Vakhnivka, 60 km north of Kiev, before being forced back by soviet forces. It was forced to retreat west, and crossed the Polish border on November 29. = Volynhia group = The Volynhia group began operations on November 4, 1921, and it also met with early successes. It won the city of Korosten, but was unable to defend it. When news of the retreat of the Podillia group became known, the Volynhia group was also forced to retreat west. However, it was encircled by Hryhorii Kotovsky's cavalry regiment near the village of Bazar. After a brief battle, most of the regiment was captured. On November 22, 1921, 359 members of the regiment were executed by firing squad. The remaining prisoners were handed over to soviet authorities. Only 120 soldiers and officers escaped.

Background and history Following the foundation of the Conservatorio Nacional de Música in La Paz in 1907, a strong insurgency for musical movements in the main cities of Bolivia originated. In Oruro, the teacher Pedro Rodriguez Santa Cruz in 1914, became the first director to conform an orchestra. Nevertheless, it was not until 1921 that the city saw the orchestra established in Oruro, directed by the violin teacher Linen Cañipa Ferreira, being reorganized in October 1930 by the Italian teacher Franco Russo. Amongst the orchestra members were acclaimed musicians such as Adrián Patiño Carpio, Franz Walk, Francisco Molo, Adolph Hirschmann, the Forns Samsó brothers, the French cellist Ginet Rougeot, the French violinists Mathilde Heimberg and Lydia Bernardini, Abel Elías and others. =Reformation= On August 19, 2006, the orchestra was refunded by a merger of classical musicians from the Ensemble Ad Libitvm, the Camacho of Oruro and the Camerata Concertante of Cochabamba.

It is a Grade II* listed building. History The Manor was owned by the Foljambe family until the 14th century when it passed by the marriage of Alice Foljambe to Sir Robert Plumpton. His son Sir William Plumpton served as High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1453. The Plumptons sold the estate in 1498 to Catherine Eyre. The manor house was substantially rebuilt in the early 17th century by Thomas Eyre. During this period the Eyres were strongly Royalist and during the Civil War the family allowed the Hall to be garrisoned by the King's Army. In 1646 the estate was sequestered by the Commonwealth and Rowland Eyre was obliged to compound at a cost of £21,000 for its return. Old Halls, Manors and Families of Derbyshire Volume I Hassop Hall. Joseph Tilley From Genuki The house was rebuilt in about 1774. In 1814 it was inherited by Francis Eyre, who had wrongly claimed the title of 6th Earl of Newburgh. The claim to the earldom was based upon the marriage of Francis Eyre (d. 1804) to Mary Radclyffe, daughter of Charles Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Derwentwater, (3rd son of Edward Radclyffe, 2nd Earl of Derwentwater) and Charlotte Maria Livingstone, 3rd Countess of Newburgh. Although Mary's brother and his son had succeeded as 4th and 5th Earl of Newburgh, Mary's claim (and therefore that of Francis) ultimately proved subordinate to that of a daughter by an earlier marriage. In 1816–17 Francis Eyre built a Roman Catholic chapel, Church of All Saints, Hassop, next to the entrance lodge of the hall; the design, by Joseph Ireland, was based on that of Inigo Jones' St Paul's Covent Garden. The building was later transferred to the Diocese of Nottingham. From 1827 Eyre altered the house itself considerably, creating a substantial mansion with a south front of three storeys and seven bays alternately canted to full height, and a pedimented Tuscan order doorway. In 1833 Mary Dorothea Eyre, who married Charles Leslie, inherited the Hassop estate. In 1919 the Leslie family sold it to Sir Henry Stephenson. The Stephenson family sold the house and grounds in 1975 to Thomas Chapman, who converted it into an hotel.Hassop Hall Hotel website with history Thomas Chapman's sons, Richard and Tom, ran the hotel in later years, keeping up its famously high standards. The hall was sold to care home owner John Hill and his wife Alex, and returned to private residential use in 2019.

There are two subtypes of this toxin: *Imperatoxin A (activator): a peptide toxin which enhances the influx of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum into the cell. *Imperatoxin I (inhibitor): a peptide toxin which decreases the influx of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum into the cell.  Imperatoxin A  The toxin comes from the venom of the African scorpion Pandinus imperator. The structure of IpTxa consists of: *33 amino acids peptide. *the formula is C148H260N58O45S6. *shares the structure and function of the dihydropiridine receptor (DHPR). It corresponds to the II-III loop of the α1s subunit. *three cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges to stabilize the three-dimensional structure. The molecular weight of the toxin is 3.7 kDa. IpTxa acts on the Ryanodine receptors (RyR), which are intracellular Ca2+ release channels mainly known for their role in regulating Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum of striated muscles. The peptide acts better on RyR type 1 than on type 3. RyR type 2 seems to be insensitive to IpTxa. The part of the peptide that looks like the II-III loop of the (DHPR) binds directly to RyR and enhances ryanodine binding to trigger Ca2+ release.  Imperatoxin I  The toxin comes from the venom of the African scorpion Pandinus imperator. The structure of IpTxi consists of: *Two polypeptides. A large subunit of 104 amino acids and a smaller one of 27 amino acids. *Subunits are linked by a disulfide bond. *Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity on the large subunit. The molecular weight of the toxin is 15 kDa. Like IpTxa, IpTxi acts on RyR. When an action potential reaches the muscle, RyR channels open and Ca2+ becomes available in the cell to induce contraction. The presence of Ca2+ induces the large subunit of IpTxi to hydrolyze the Sn2 fatty acyl bond from the membrane of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum. This process is executed by PLA2 activity. The freed fatty acids bind to the RyR itself or to a closely associated protein linked to gating. Binding of the RyR induces blocking of the channel. When the concentration of free fatty acids is low there will be an incomplete block of RyR; higher concentrations will give a complete block. Because IpTxi also works on the RyR channels of the heart muscles, it could potentially be used as a drug against arrhythmia. This has not yet been proven, and must be studied in vivo first.

It is east of Alton; and south-west of Wyck. Hartley Mauditt and West Worldham are nearby, which, along with East Worldham, form the Parish of Worldham. The village is just east of the A31 road and contains St Mary's Church and the Three Horse Shoes pub, amongst other buildings. Worldham Golf Course located just to west and Dean Farm Golf Course just to the east. For centuries the village and surrounding parish were owned by Winchester College. History Archaeological findings in the fields between West and East Worldham reveal that the area has been visited and inhabited since at least the Palaeolithic era. An Iron Age Hillfort, dated to around 100 BC, lay on the summit of King John's Hill, to the east of East Worldham. The Romans built a road from Chichester to Silchester which passed below the hill over what is now Green Street and Pookles Lane. The village is believed to have been part of \\"Werildeham\\", mentioned in the Domesday Book. There have been multiple spellings of the name, including Werildeham; Wardham, 11th century; Wirldham, 12th century; Verildham, 13th century; Verilham and YV'erlham, 14th century; and Wardelham, 16th century. Manor Farm For several centuries, the manor of East Worldham was held by the Venuz (or Venuiz) family, associated with marshall service, a sergeantry connected with the custody of the forests of Woolmer and Alice Holt. According to Samuel Tymms, \\"Robert de Venuz held the manors of East Worldham, in Hants, and Draycote, in Wilts, by the sergeantry of performing the office of Marshal. These manors, by the Domesday Survey, are said to be held by Geoffrey le Marshal. From the proximity of the period there appears little doubt but that this Geffrey left two daughters and coheiresses, married to Robert de Venuz and Gilbert le Marshal, which latter seems to have acquired the office indicated by his name, not however without a dispute from his co-inheritor, whose lands being held by virtue of serving the office, would entitle their holder to fill it.\\" A dispute arose concerning the inheritance of the manor in the early part of the 14th century. The Patent Rolls noted that, as the result of a trial in 1329, it passed, on the death of Margery, widow of John Venuiz, to the Burghersh family. There is also a recorded release by Thomas, son and heir of John de Venuz, to Sir John de Burghersh, knight, of all his right in East Worldham manor. Thomas Chaucer married Matilda, daughter and coheiress of Sir John Burghersh, nephew of Henry Burghersh, Bishop of Lincoln, becoming the owner of the manor. East Worldham Village Hall Documents indicate the Gurdons or Gordons occupied the village from at least the 13th century when Sir Adam de Gurdon held property. In 1472 the Gurdon holding was purchased by Winchester College who would increasingly grow to dominate the parish over the next 500 years. The Sandals holding later merged with the Gurdons and documents exist indicating the existence of the Sandals in 1255 and another in 1329, witnessed by a John de Sandale. For centuries, village life centred on the old farm holdings of the Manor; the Shelleys, Freres, Sandals and Gurdons (now merged into Old House Farm), and the Heathers, Clays, Porters, Park, Smiths and some descendants of these families continue to live in the village today and many old farm buildings still exist. The naturalist and ornithologist Gilbert White immortalised the localities of the region, including East Worldham, in his The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789). By at least the mid-19th century, East Worldham and most of the parish of Worldham was owned by both Winchester College and the Dutton Estate. From the early 1860s when Dr. Fell became vicar in the village, East Worldham underwent dramatic change, which the renovation of the church and additions of hop kilns to the local farms and the building of new cottages, most of which form the urban landscape of the village today. In 1892 Mr Hall of Alton, financed the \\"lowering of the gradients of Worldham Hill by smoothing out four sections\\", a steep hill which had caused many problems to the local inhabitants as it lay along the main road to the village. The first Parish Council meeting took place in 1894 in the schoolroom. In May 1944, a Junkers JU188 was shot down by a Mosquito nearby and its debris was scattered across the nearby village of West Worldham, including the church wall. Later, the inhabitants had to be evacuated when a bomb fell into the field opposite Manor Farm, and had to be defused and removed by the Royal Engineers. In 1962, the Dutton Estate holdings were sold to seven tenant farmers who retained the land they farmed but sold the remaining woodlands and properties. Geography The Greensand Ridge near East Worldham East Worldham is located in the eastern central part of Hampshire, in the south-east of England, south-east of Alton. It is situated at above sea level. The landscape is dominated by farmland and several woods such as Warner's Wood, Pheasant Wood to the south and Furzefield Copse, Rookery Copse, Great Wood, Tanner's Copse, Pondfield Copse, Monk Wood and New Copse to the north are in the vicinity as is the small hamlet of Wyck. Situated on the edge of a rock terrace, the chalk of Alton is on the west. The village slopes down abruptly to the gault adjoining Kingsley on the east. Oakhanger Stream adjoins the River Wey from East Worldham to Kinglsey. Lodge Hill, or King John's Hill, is the site of a hunting lodge of John, King of England; it is situated on an isolated eminence to the south-east of the parish by Woolmer Forest. Chloritic Marl, characterised as a narrow band at the base of the Chalk Marl, is seen in the lane leading from Alton to West and East Worldham, and also north-west of Selbourne. Blanket Street connects the village to West Worldham a mile to the south-west and Hartley Mauditt just beyond that. At East Worldham this road meets the B3004 road (Caker's Lane/Green Street) near The Three Horseshoes and is the main road passing through the village from the A31 road, leading to the A325 road in the east. The nearest railway station is Alton, north-west of the village. Economy In 2001 East Worldham contained roughly two-thirds of the population of 336 people who lived in the whole Parish of Worldham. Most houses in the area date to the pre-20th century; however in recent times numerous farm buildings have been converted to housing and for industrial purposes. According to the parish website, there are now \\"two significant industrial developments within the parish\\". The local economy is based around agriculture, particularly cattle farming. Beef cattle, sheep, grain crops, and hops are the main sources of income, Farmers from the area Worldham traded in Southampton and Alton throughout its history. Most inhabitants are either retired or commute to nearby towns to work. Golf is also important to the local economy, with Worldham Golf Course located just to west and Dean Farm Golf Course just to the east. The Jalsa Salana, an annual convention held at Oaklands Farm nearby, attracts numerous people from surrounding areas. Red Bug Productions are based in the parish cottages along the main road. Notable landmarks West wall of St Mary's Church East Worldham contains 10 Grade II listed buildings. St Mary's Church is of Transitional Norman architecture and is a Grade II* listed building. Notable features include triple lancet windows, a small pointed tower, three bells, and stained glass by Hardman & Co.. The chancel was restored in 1864, and in 1865, the nave was rebuilt. During the late restoration, a stone monument, like a coffin, was found under the floor of the church, which contained the figure of a 13th-century lady. Magdalen College, Oxford is patron of the vicarage. A church school was built in 1864 upon a site donated by James Dutton, 3rd Baron Sherborne. The Old Hop Kiln (Oast House) East Worldham House, a Grade II listed building, dates to the late 18th and early 19th century. The two-storey house is made with ashlar walls, flat arches and stone cills. The entrance is located on the west side and features a Tuscan porch in the centre, with 5 windows, one of them large. The interior of the house contains Regency features, with a staircase, panelled doors in architraves, and several fireplaces. The coach house, 5 metres to the north of the house is also a listed building, dated to the early 19th century. It is made of malmstone ashlar, with the upper wall of the centre boarded with a hay loft door and has a hipped slate roof. Today this building functions as a garage and workshop. The Old House Farmhouse on Shelleys Lane is believed by the parish authorities to have originally been the oldest building in the village, but the current building dates to only the 17th and early and late 19th century. The walls are made of coursed malmstone with brick dressings, rendered with a plinth. The roof is apparently unusual with the \\"northern half being of steeper pitch, both sections half-hipped, with a slate roof above the wing.\\" It became a Grade II listed building on 1 May 1983. The Manor Farmhouse building, also a Grade II listed building, dates to the early 17th century, with alterations in the mid-19th century, containing Victorian window sashes. Three Horseshoes Pub, East Worldham The Sandals farm contains three cottages dated to the 17th century. Heather Cottage is another 17th-century cottage, with 20th-century additions to the rear, on Worldham Hill, noted for its thatched roof. It is believed to be named after William Heather, a resident mentioned in the 1665 Hearth Tax returns. It became a listed building on 18 July 1986. The Three Horseshoes Public House was first licensed in 1834 and is one of the main features of the village. It was rebuilt some 50 years later by Henry Newman. Also of note is the Rectory House on Wyck Lane, and the Oast House, just to the west of the rectory.

It used to serve as the armed branch of the SDECE. Its insignia, designed by lieutenant Dupas, features Bagheera in the moonlight and a golden wing. The motto is Qui ose gagne (\\"who dares wins\\"), in continuation of the tradition of the British Special Air Service.  History  The 11e choc was meant from the start to constitute a reserve of soldiers available to the French special services. The 11e choc was initially composed of one single battalion, the 11e bataillon parachutiste de choc. From 1 September 1946, it was stationned in Mont-Louis. In the aftermath of the Second World War, an \\"action service\\" of the SDECE was created by Jacques Morlane. It grouped veterans of the Second World War having served in the Bataillon de Choc of 1936, in the 1er bataillon de choc (founded in 1943), or as SOE agents, as well as veterans of Indochina.Minister of Defence, Service historique de la défense, Département de l'innovation technologique et des entrées extraordinaires, Bureau des témoignages oraux, Histoire orale.

Château de Vincennes, 2005. p.137 In spring of 1947, Morlane sent R. Mautaint in Mont- Louis to train the new unit. Mautaint had authored numerous reports on SOE training that inspired that of the French services.Minister of Defence, Service historique de la défense, op.cit., p.210 In July 1947, as the complement of the 11e choc grew, Morlane nominated Paul Aussaresses to replace Mautaint. Aussaresses described his mission as \\"perform what was by then called 'psychological warfare', wherever it was necessary, notably in Indochina (...) I trained my men for clandestine operations, airborne or otherwise, that could range from building demolition to sabotage or elimination of enemies\\".Interview with Marie-Monique Robin, quoted in Escadrons de la mort, l'école française, 2008, chap. IV, p.49 From 1952, elements of the 11e choc were sent to Indochina to lead and train the Groupement de commandos mixtes aéroportés (GCMA), though the 11e Choc did not take part in the conflict as a unit. Back from Indochina in 1952, Aussaresses was tasked to assassinate supporters of the FLN. Morlane \\"was convinced that a Soviet invasion was imminent, and had been busy constituting secret weapon caches all over the territory so that, when time would come, a resistance could be organised\\".Paul Aussaresses, Pour la France : Services spéciaux 1942-1954, Editions du Rocher, 2001, p.257 On 1 October 1955, a 12e bataillon parachutiste de choc was created. It was stationned in Calvi and Corte, in Corsica. Together, the 11th and 12th Battalions were the 11e demi-brigade parachutiste de choc (11e DBPC),\\"demi-brigade\\" is a term dating back to the French Revolution that designs a regiment-strong unit. The term was crafted to remove the Ancien Régime connotation of \\"regiment\\", which was traditionally associated to nobility. also formed on 1 October. The insignia of the 12e BPC featured an eagle and a star on a parachute background. In late October 1956, elements of both battalions took part in the Suez Crisis. The 12e BPC was disbanded on 30 April 1957 and immediately re-created as the 1er bataillon parachutiste de choc. Its insignia featured a dagger with a map of France as background, and its motto was En pointe toujours (\\"at the tip, always\\"). From 1 May 1957, the 11e DBPC was thus constituted of the 11th BPC, the 1st BPC and the bataillon d'instruction spécialisé (BIS, \\"training special battalion\\"), based in Calvi, Corté, Collioure, and Mont-Louis. During the Algerian War, the 11e Choc at first deployed a groupement léger d'intervention (GLI, \\"light intervention group\\"), and later a groupement de marche (GM 11.DBPC), as well as local antennas of the \\"action service\\", and a specialised detachment called DS 111. The 11e Choc did not take part in the Algiers putsch of 1961, but some officers did sympathise towards the putschists. The unit was disbanded on 31 December 1963 and its standard handed over to the National Commando Training Centre at Mont-Louis.

The series chronicles the adventures of an excessively helpful and enthusiastic dog named Ed and his best friend, Doug the squirrel and soldier, whom everyone calls \\"Buddy\\" because Ed refers to him as best buddy. They live in their fictional hometown of Swellville. Best Ed is produced by 9 Story Entertainment and animated using Adobe Flash software.Kuzmyk , Jenn: 9 Story Entertainment, C21 Media, February 9, 2006. The fifth episode premiered on October 3, 2008 on Teletoon as a sneak preview. However, subsequent episodes were only shown beginning October 5, 2009. Alt URL The series ended on October 22, 2009. 26 episodes were produced. Overview The series follows two anthropomorphic animals, Ed and Buddy, a dog and a squirrel respectively, who live in the town of Swellville (parody Snellville) in the north of the United States. Their adventures and sometimes mis-adventures usually cause them to interact with other characters. While Ed is well-liked by all, and extremely lucky, Buddy is vehemently despised, and extremely unlucky, gratuitously so. Characters =Main= Ed (voiced by Sean Cullen) – A yellow dog. Ed is overenthusiastic and helpful, but rather dimwitted. He has many catchphrases, such as his trademark 'Yee!' and 'I'm here to help!', as well as 'Sacagawea!', 'Krakatoa!' and 'Well isn't that curious?' He has a speech impediment which makes him often say 'sh' rather than 's'. He has 'happy sandals', and is a frequent viewer of The Mighty Measel Moles, a Star Trek parody, both of which Buddy hates. He has numerous skills. Much focus is drawn to his navel. He is well liked by everyone in the neighborhood, although he considers Buddy his best friend. * Buddy AKA Doug (voiced by Pat McKenna) – An orange squirrel. Buddy is more level-headed and intelligent than Ed. He suffers incredibly from the antics of Ed, and everyone else (through either neglect or abuse), and only ends the episode happily in only a few episodes. He still does consider himself good friends with Ed. Everyone else dislikes him. He enjoys nuts, and has a car with a giant acorn for a roof. He was part of a club devoted to the nerdy role playing game Battle Buddies awhile ago. His catchphrases are \\"Oh no, please, no!\\" and 'It's Doug, actually'. =Recurring= Mr. Thursty (Thurston Plumtickler III) (voiced by Kedar Brown) - A large, brown dog. Mr. Thursty is paranoid and aggressive. His sidekick is Eugene. He speaks with an African-American accent. He is very jealous of Buddy. * Miss Fluffé (voiced by Carolyn Scott) - A yellow hamster. Miss Fluffé resembles the stereotypical fortune teller, but this is not an often employed trait. She has a crush on Ed. * The Kitten Twins (Betsy voiced by Sarah Commisso, Buster voiced by Tessa Marshall) - Pink cats. Betsy and Buster appear cute and innocent, but are the worst of the lot. They tend to speak at the same time and giggle a lot. They are very rich, due to their high paying jobs as top mitten testers. They ride unicycles, as displayed in \\"Best Ed The Movie\\". * Dr. Quacken (voiced by Jamie Watson) - A tall green duck who wears glasses and a white jacket. He is Ed and Buddy's family doctor. Whenever he gives Buddy the bill, he uses \\"duck bill humor\\". He loves playing golf, and does not know what club to use on the ninth hole. * Eugene Tuttle - A short, green and brown turtle. Eugene is frequently picked on by Mr. Thursty. He lives in a house shaped liked a shell, surrounded by a moat. He is the only reptile in the neighbourhood. He appears infrequently compared to everybody else in the neighborhood, and is shy and nervous. He has not been mean to Buddy yet. * Heiny (voiced by Damon Papadopoulos) - A Scottish Terrier who wears a kilt and has a Scottish accent who is a crossing guard. Heiny appears to have a temper as he is yelling most of the time. * Whithey, Blakie and Red - Three squirrels and brothers who attended the same college as Buddy. The group hosts annual Battle Buddy Weekends with Buddy.

Life =Early life= Morris was born in Ootacamund, Tamil Nadu, then under the British Raj. He was a son of John Carnac Morris, FRS, an official of the East India Company who was also a noted scholar of Telugu, and of his wife, Rosanna Curtis. He was educated partly in India, partly at Harrow School, partly in reading for Cambridge with Dean Alford, the New Testament scholar. Under him a great change passed over Morris's ideas. Giving up the thought of taking the law as his profession, he became enthusiastic for ecclesiastical antiquities, took a deep interest in the Tractarian movement, and resolved to become an Anglican clergyman. Going up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1845, Morris became the friend, and then the pupil of F. A. Paley, grandson of the well-known divine, and already one of the leading Greek scholars of the university. The conversion to Catholicism of John Henry Newman, followed by many others, impressed him, and he was converted by Bishop Wareing, 20 May 1846. A storm followed, beginning in The Times, which made itself felt even in Parliament. Paley had to leave Cambridge (which led to his subsequently joining the Catholic Church), while Morris was practically cast off by his family. He then went to the English College, Rome, under Dr. Thomas Grant, and was there during the Revolutions of 1848. He was ordained a Catholic priest the following year, and returned to England. =Jesuit priest= When Morris returned to England, he was initially stationed in Northampton, and later in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. Soon after the restoration of the English Catholic hierarchy in 1850, he was named a canon of the new Diocese of Northampton. He returned to Rome to serve as the Vice- Rector of the English College (1853–1856). During this period, he became postulator for the English Martyrs, whose cause for beatification he greatly advanced. Returning to England, he took part in the third Synod of Westminster, became secretary to Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman, whom he nursed on his death-bed, and then served under Wiseman's successor, Henry Edward Manning, until he left to become a Jesuit in 1867. Morris went to Belgium where he was admitted to the novitiate of the Society of Jesus in Louvain, and professed simple vows in 1869. He was then assigned to the Jesuit community in Roehampton, and became the first Superior of the Jesuit Mission in Oxford. He taught Church History from 1873–1874 at the College of St. Beuno, in Tremeirchion, Wales; he was the founding Rector of St. Ignatius of Loyola College in Luqa, Malta, in 1877. He returned to England in 1880 to serve as the Master of novices for the newly established English Jesuit Province, serving in that position until 1886. He was named a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1889 and in 1891 he became the director of the staff of Jesuit writers at the Immaculate Conception Church, Farm Street, operated by the Jesuits in Mayfair. Morris retired to Wimbledon, London, in 1893. He died there while preaching in the pulpit, uttering the words, \\"Render to God the things that are God's.\\" Works Morris's major works were: *The Life and Martyrdom of St. Thomas Becket (London, 1859 and 1885); *The Life of Father John Gerard (London, 1881), translated into French, German, Spanish, and Polish; *Troubles of our Catholic Forefathers (3 vols., London, 1872–1877); *Letter-books of Sir Amias Poulet (London, 1874); He contributed to The Month, The Dublin Review, Archæologia, and other periodicals.

Alford is the president and chief executive officer of Allied Energy Services, LLC and spokesman for Power4Georgians, LLC, which company was originally organized by an employee of Allied Energy Services, LLC. Power4Georgians seeks to develop several Coal-fired power plants in Georgia, which plants have been found to cause hundreds of thousands of early deaths each year, mainly from air pollution, with efforts of Power4Georgians resulting in some members withdrawing because of the uncertainty over carbon emissions, resulting in possible corruption, resulting in an organizer of Power4Georgians being indicted for theft and racketeering, and resulting in an administrative law judge's ruling that environmental regulators had failed to properly review a proposed coal-fired power plant's plans that could affect water quality. The State of Georgia arrested Alford on allegations he forged a state employee’s signature, committed racketeering, and filed fraudulent invoices to show account collectibles of $2,200,000 in taxpayer and other companies' funds for his company, Allied Energy Services, LLC., to sell the false collectibles at a discount to Versant, a collectibles purchaser. Alford is also a defendant in two federal lawsuits, one by multiple investors accusing him of operating a Ponzi scheme, and one by creditors, while in July 2020, he agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to the entry of a consent judgment that he violated federal anti-fraud laws by running the Ponzi scheme.  Early life and education  Alford graduated from Walker High School, which has since been renamed McNair High School, in DeKalb County in 1971. He then attended Georgia Tech, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1976 and also served as the Chapter President of Beta Theta Pi (Gamma Eta Chapter).  Business career  Alford founded A&C; Enercom in 1978. He has served as the president and CEO of Allied Energy Services, LLC since 2000.  Legislative career  From 1983 until 1993, Alford was a five-term member of the General Assembly in Georgia. Alford represented the 57th district, post 3, and served as chairman of the Energy Subcommittee, chairman of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority Oversight Committee, and as chairman of the DeKalb and Rockdale County Legislative Delegation. Other political experience Georgia Technology Authority: Alford was sworn in 1999 by Governor Roy Barnes as member of the Georgia Technology Authority (GTA) and served in this capacity until 2003. GTA is responsible for all aspects of technology procurement and policy for the State of Georgia. * Georgia State Board of Education: Served as a member from September 2003 to December 2006. * Governor's Education Finance Task Force: Appointed by Governor Sonny Perdue to Chair the Governor's Education Finance Task Force. The Task Force has been charged with the task of developing a new funding formula for the K-12 system of Georgia. * Department of Technical and Adult Education: Appointed by Governor Sonny Perdue to serve on the board of directors in January 2007. * Member of the Georgia Board of Regents from 2012 until he resigned in 2019 amid a state investigation into allegations of racketeering, forgery of a state employee’s signatures and filing fraudulent invoices to show account collectibles of $2,200,000 in taxpayer and other companies' funds for his company, Allied Energy Services, LLC., to sell the false collectibles at a discount to Versant, a collectibles purchaser.  Criminal Allegations and Civil Actions It was reported by the Atlanta Journal Constitution on October 3, 2019, that the Attorney General of Georgia and Georgia Bureau of Investigation issued arrest warrants for Alford on suspected racketeering and criminal attempt to commit theft by taking charges. It is alleged that Alford created fraudulent invoice acknowledgement forms, dated Sept. 24, to submit to Versant, a financial services company that buys accounts receivable at a discount, state officials said. One document is alleged to have falsely asserted that the University of Georgia should pay Versant $487,982.88 to satisfy a debt owed to Alford’s own company, Allied Energy Services, LLC, located in Rockdale County. Alford allegedly forged a university employee’s signature on the document. Alford is alleged to have also perpetrated further receivables fraud involving Georgia Military College, Synovus and Inman Solar Inc. to obtain a total of about $2,200,000 for his Allied Energy Services company. Don Waters, Chairman of the Georgia Board of Regents, related that “The allegations brought against Dean Alford, who resigned from the Board today, are shocking and deeply upsetting. We will continue assisting law enforcement in any capacity necessary throughout the investigation.” Later in October 2019, approximately 40 investors filed a lawsuit against Alford in federal court in the Middle District of Georgia, alleging Alford took $6 million from them through a Ponzi scheme. This was followed in January 2020 with a lawsuit against Alford by three Virginia residents filed in federal court in the Northern District of Georgia accusing Alford of failing to repay a total of $160,000. On July 30, 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced charges against Alford relating to a Ponzi scheme. Alford is accused of \\"defrauding at least 100 investors in his now-bankrupt energy development company, Allied Energy Services LLC.\\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-168 Alford was accused of using money he raised to make interest payments to earlier investors and for personal expenses, such as building a multi-million dollar home. Alford agreed to entry of a consent judgment that he violated federal anti-fraud laws by running the Ponzi scheme. Personal life Alford helped start the Miracle League, an organization that provides baseball fields for children with mental and physical disabilities, creating more than 240 baseball fields in the U.S. and Canada.

It was developed by the Wikimedia Foundation for use on Wikipedia and similar wikis hosted on its servers. The term is also sometimes used for the editorial policies related to operation of that extension when active. Detail Flagged revisions was a planned editorial policy of English Wikipedia aimed at \\"imposing a layer of editorial review on articles about living people\\". Wikipedia's co-founder, Jimmy Wales, originally urged Wikipedia to adopt the policy in January 2009 after the Wikipedia pages of Robert Byrd and Edward Kennedy were both vandalized to state, incorrectly, that they were dead. It was announced in August 2009, after a poll found that 80% of the users were in favor of it. It provides for \\"experienced volunteer editors\\" to approve changes to some articles. It is already in use in the German Wikipedia, where all articles are subject to this policy. In the English Wikipedia, a two- months initial trial took place in 2010. It was considered a possibility that all articles would be covered by this feature in the future, just like in the German Wikipedia. The New York Times remarked that the new policy divides Wikipedia users in two classes: \\"experienced, trusted editors, and everyone else—altering Wikipedia's implicit notion that everyone has an equal right to edit entries\\". Brennon Slattery of PCWorld reported that \\"some bloggers\\" received the announced changes as a \\"failure\\" of the philosophy behind Wikipedia. According to the chairman of the Wikimedia Foundation board at the time, with this policy there is less tolerance for \\"inaccurate or fudged\\" articles. The feature is based on a plug-in for the MediaWiki software that prevents recent changes to wiki articles from being displayed to all readers until they have been ratified by editors with special permissions. On June 14, 2010, English Wikipedia began a 2-month trial of a similar feature known as pending changes. After a discussion among English Wikipedia editors in May 2011, this feature was initially removed from all articles, but consensus in a 2012 discussion decided that the feature would be implemented.

Based in San Mateo, California, United States, the company operates on a freemium basis, offering basic features free of charge and more advanced features for a fee. PBworks' investors include Mohr Davidow Ventures and the Seraph Group, as well as angel investors Ron Conway and Chris Yeh. History In 2005, David Weekly began developing software to build privately hosted wikis through a website, which he named \\"PeanutButterWiki\\" The company's original name stems from the concept that \\"making a wiki is as easy as making a peanut butter sandwich\\". The original beta test of PBworks was released for public comment on 31 May 2005. The site was formally launched in June 2005. In early 2008, the company launched PBworks 2.0, an improved version with a new layout, more granular security, and a more easily customizable color scheme. PBworks also launched a Mobile Edition in early 2009. In June 2008, the company hired Jim Groff, a former employee of Oracle Corporation and Apple Inc., for its new CEO. David Weekly, the former CEO, remains its Chief Product Officer and Chairman. Today PBworks contains over 6.91 million pages of user content. In 2014, the team behind PBworks began development of its next-generation product, Dokkio. Software PBworks is hosted on an all-Linux cluster and uses its own proprietary software. In early 2007, it added WYSIWYG editing, and in 2008, limited HTML source editing. Since 2009, the wiki is entirely HTML based, and original wiki markup language is no longer supported. Users can create free basic wiki workspaces or upgrade to a premium plan to access additional features, such as enhanced security features, customization through CSS, and more storage space. Workspaces can be configured as either public or private (only viewable by those who have been invited to join the workspace). The software is only available in English. Usage A number of businesses and corporations use PBworks to create private wikis for employees; one case study described a legal firm which had transitioned to PBworks as a document management system in order to cut their IT costs. Major companies using PBworks to host internal documents include CafePress.com, Capgemini, Deloitte, Financial Times, Kiva, and Wideload Games. Many educational groups and educators use PBworks, too, including DePaul University, the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, the University of Toronto, the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and Wayne State University.

Plot  Diana Markham, an upper class schoolteacher in London, is preparing to marry her fiancé, the caddish Oliver, who comes from a wealthy family. As the couple's wedding approaches, Diana is plagued by bizarre nightmares which cast Oliver in violent and cruel roles, including ones in which he humiliates, abuses, and rapes her. Upon moving into her new home, she also has fiery visions of a young blonde girl adorned with angel wings. Diana is particularly frightened of the home's basement. Her therapist, Deborah, assures her the dreams are a result of stress regarding the pending wedding, especially the harassment Diana receives from the press attempting to cover the wedding. While being assailed outside her home by crude photographer Peck and investigative journalist Paul, Diana is helped by Jenny, an outspoken American tourist from Los Angeles who fights them off. Diana invites Jenny in for a drink, and Jenny soon confesses that she is visiting in hopes of unearthing her family origins: She was adopted as a young child but has no memory of her English biological parents. The only information she has is that they once lived in Diana's home, and that it is their last known address. Diana takes a liking to Jenny, and the women agree to meet the following day. Later that night, Diana has a hallucinogenic nightmare in which Peck breaks into her home and attacks her. In the morning, Jenny arrives and Diana explains her nightmare. Shortly after, the women find Paul in the basement of the home. He threatens Diana, and says that Peck has gone missing. After the incident, Jenny agrees to stay with Diana to comfort her. Diana confides her anxieties about her marriage, and admits to Jenny that she is a virgin. Some time later, Jenny experiences a hallucination in which she is attacked by a deformed Peck, and witnesses a young blonde girl being verbally abused by her father. She flees and manages to awaken Diana, who has fallen asleep on the couch, after which the apparent supernatural occurrences cease. The next morning, the women meet with Deborah, who proposes the idea that Jenny astral projected. The women realize that Diana's dreams have the power to impact waking life. Upon returning to the home, both women are plagued by shared visions and frightening hallucinations anchored to the basement. Terrified, Jenny returns to her hotel, insisting that the home is haunted, and books a return flight to California. Diana falls asleep in Jenny's hotel room. Meanwhile, Paul arrives at the hotel, having been following the women, and confronts Jenny with information he has uncovered about Oliver: He is in financial ruin and is marrying Diana for economic security. Realizing that Diana is again dreaming, Jenny attempts to wake her, but Diana slips into another nightmare in which she is tormented by deformed versions of Paul and Peck. Diana awakens in Jenny's hotel room, but is skeptical of whether she is experiencing a waking reality or another dream. The women become separated, and Diana experiences further disturbing visions of the young blonde girl, as well as Peck and Paul. Diana awakens again in her disheveled bedroom and is confronted by Oliver and Deborah, who drug her to fall back asleep. Later, Diana is hospitalized and affixed with a brainwave monitor. While astral projecting, Diana looks on as Deborah watches old footage of the young blonde girl in a hospital therapy session—the girl is in fact Jenny during her childhood, shortly before she was sent to live in the United States. In the astral plane, Diana returns to her home and saves Jenny, who has been trapped in a void. The two again become separated, and Jenny relives her repressed childhood trauma: Her widowed father, a violent and abusive artist, tied her to a sculpture in his basement art studio to use as a model. While sharpening a sculpting tool, he ignited a fire with a can of turpentine in which he was burned alive. An adult Jenny, bound to the sculpture, is saved by Diana. The women embrace before fleeing the home together. Later, Diana and Jenny visit Jenny's father's gravestone, which features a stone cast of her with angel wings. Back in the empty home, which Diana has now put up for sale, Peck and Paul emerge from a brick wall, alive and in one piece, and decide to go get something to eat; cautiously ignoring Peck regrowing his ear.  Cast  Production Cokeliss was inspired by Billy Wilder and surrealist films when designing the film's dream sequences. The film was shot on a budget of £2 million. Release The film was released theatrically in England on 14 October 1988. =Critical response= The Guardian criticized the film for failing to \\"follow its own logic,\\" but conceded that the film is \\"often smartly made, and the special effects are excellent.

It was later packed and shipped in combination with Interplay's Planescape: Torment. Plot It starts off with the story of a young man arriving in a town called Madrigal to find his uncle Andrus, who is the man's only remaining family member after his father died. However, the protagonist is soon caught in the middle of strange bandit activity around town and then drawn into escalating political and supernatural strife across the world. During the game, it is revealed that the hero is a reincarnation of a powerful being whose purpose is to defeat a group of ancient demons known as Revenants. Even though forgotten, the Revenants are secretly standing behind all major conflicts and problems encountered. The hero has to reawaken his past-life powers, travel to parallel worlds and ultimately trap the Revenants within the mystical Well of Souls. The game includes both a good and an evil ending.  Gameplay  The game is 3D with a helicopter POV For the combat system, each weapon has a set of possible moves, with more powerful moves becoming available as points are put into the \\"combat\\" skill. The game includes a novel magic system. Rather than having reflexively opposing categories of magic, Soulbringer's magic system is circular: Air suppresses earth, which suppresses spirit which suppresses water, which suppresses fire, which suppresses air. Considerable strategy is thus needed to achieve a desired balance within the elements. Spells are obtained from spellbooks that are unlocked by runes; more powerful spells become accessible as points are put into the \\"magic\\" skill. A spell's power depends on magic skill and on strength within the elements that make up the spell. Each move and spell requires a certain amount of time to prepare and execute (including drawing the weapon, if necessary) Motion capture was used to display such actions for added realism. Soulbringer also takes terrain and placement into account (e.g. spiders on the ground can only be hit by \\"low\\" attacks while an enemy soldier higher up on a hill can only be hit by \\"high\\" attacks) Combinations of attacks and spells can be preset and assigned to a hot key. NPC and wins, gaining XP. Reception Eric Bratcher reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"If you've already beaten Diablo II and Icewind Dale, and you simply cannot wait for Baldur's Gate II and Arcanum, this game will keep you from RPG starvation. But it won't taste like steak.\\" The game received lackluster reviews and was not a great seller for Interplay.

History The village was established in 1553, and there were several subsequent waves of settlement, notably in the years 1589, 1699, and 1748. The name \\"Przybyszow\\" derives from a word meaning \\"newcomer\\" or \\"stranger\\". The village was located on land previously owned by the Polish nobleman Nicholas Herburt Odnowski since 1539 (More history, in Polish, about Odnowski can be found at this link:pl:Mikołaj Herburt Odnowski) In the year 1898 the village had 393 inhabitants and 62 houses, the village area was 6.37 km ². It was owned at that time by a Polish noble family named Scibor-Rylski. From November 1918 to January 1919 it was part of the Komańcza Republic . The village ceased to exist after World War II, when the entire population was deported to Ukraine as part of Soviet and Polish population exchange operations. (UPA sotnias (units) had been stationed in this village, and the village was subsequently burned.)

The first 120 years 1869–1989  As in all countries of Central Europe also in Poland trade unions were active since the end of the 19th century, particularly in the Prussian and Austrian partition regions. 1869 the first Trade Union (of a branch) of Mechanical Engineers and Metal Workers in Bromberg. In 1889 the first general 'Union of Mutual Help' (ZWP) was founded in the town of Bytom (Beuthen) in Silesia. Some of the historical trade unions maneuvered their way through all system changes, for example today's biggest affiliated union of the country, namely the Polish Teachers' Union (ZNP) which was established in 1905. Around 1906 there were already over 2000 trade unions gathered in about 30 central associations. Much of the trade union movement was ideologically divided. After the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 all socio-political organisations, including trade unions, were prohibited by the German occupying forces. Many activists were deported to concentration camps and murdered, others died in the resistance movement. After 1945 the communist system forced all refounded trade unions into line. Regime trade unions became the fundamental element of workers' organisations, which was also aimed at preventing solidarity in state combines and regions. The aim was to make unions an instrument of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR). However, this repeatedly met with violent resistance of the workers in the industrial centres, like in Poznań in 1956, in the northern coastal cities in 1970, in Radom and Ursus in 1976 as well as at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk in 1980. The most significant result was the foundation of the Independent Self- governing Trade Union ‘Solidarity’(NSZZ Solidarnosc) in August 1980, a mass organisation with almost 10 million members. This led in autumn 1980 to the self-dissolution of the 'Central Council of Trade Unions' (CRZZ) which was subordinated to the PZPR. During Martial Law, which was introduced on 13 December 1981 and lasted until June 1983, Solidarnosc was banned and the controlled refoundation of trade unions dependent on state orders began. In establishments and state combines affiliated unions were founded. Only in 1984 the 'All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions' (OPZZ) was set up as an umbrella organisation to coordinate them. The OPZZ received not only all properties of the CRZZ, but also of the banned Solidarnosc.  Development of trade unions and membership after 1989  After the regime changes of the year 1989 OPZZ remained the strongest trade union federation, but like all other trade unions it recorded a dramatical decrease in membership. While in the middle of the nineties about 4.5 million people were members of OPZZ, this number fell to under 2 million by the year 2001 and it is estimated that in 2007 there were less than 750.000 members. At the beginning of 2002 a new trade union federation split away from OPZZ, namely the FZZ Forum with 515.000 members mainly from civil service, local governments, railways, energy, mines and other state-owned enterprises. In autumn 1981 ten million people belonged to NSZZ Solidarnosc, but after its second legalization in April 1989 it did not manage to regain its previous significance and number of members. While in 2001 there still were about 1.1 million members, in December 2005 there were only 721.8561. At the same time there are drastic differences between state enterprises and civil service, where about 28 per cent of employees belong to trade unions, and the private sector, where only 3 per cent are organised in trade unions2. From 1982 until 2005 the overall degree of unionization fell from 80 per cent to below 14 per cent. This dramatic decline lead to Poland being one of the EU-countries with the lowest degree of unionization. Most of the trade unions' members (51.7 per cent) are women, especially in the educational sector, health and civil services, but also 35 per cent of members of mining trade unions are female. Only 2.4 per cent of employees under the age of 25 belong to a trade union. 1 Report of the 20th national congress of NSZZ Solidarnosc, 28–20 September 2006, p. 33 2 Public Opinion Research Center CBOS, Polish Public Opinion, 11/2006, p. 4 3 Juliusz Gardawski, Declining trade union density examined, 'Foundation Institute of Public Affairs', Warsaw 2002, published in 'Eiro-Portal' (European Industrial Relations Observatory on-line). 4 Juliusz Gardawski, Declining trade union density examined, 'Foundation Institute of Public Affairs', Warsaw 2002, published in 'Eiro- Portal' (European Industrial Relations Observatory on-line). The reasons for this rapid deterioration are essentially as follows4: \\\\- massive shrinkage of traditional industries and sectors, such as mining and steel, \\\\- in privatised establishments (\\"brownfield investment\\") with over 250 employees trade unions mostly remained, in mid-sized establishments about one third remained. In small establishments there are almost no trade unions, \\\\- new private enterprises (\\"greenfield investments\\"): among big enterprises only 5 per cent of Polish establishments and 33 per cent of foreign establishments have trade unions, in mid-sized and small establishments there are practically no trade unions, \\\\- technology-orientated undertakings like those in the IT-branch with their young staff, who often have academic degrees, have almost no unionization, \\\\- due to high unemployment, which in some regions reaches 30 per cent and in the whole country 12 per cent (November 2007), many employees are afraid of founding or joining a trade union.  The role of trade unions in Polish politics after the transformation 1989  From its beginning in August 1980 Solidarność was not only a trade union but also a political movement. Many later political groupings and parties stem from this environment. All in all 23 political parties had their roots and leaders linked to Solidarność, amongst them today's biggest governing party ‘Civic Platform’ (PO) and the biggest opposition party ‘Law and Justice’ (PiS). Although the relations between political parties and trade unions used to be close, this decreased after 2000, but is still visible. Solidarność sympathises with the conservative parties of the national catholic right-wing, whereas OPZZ tends towards alliances with the post-communist Left. During the transformation period national trade unions were highly politicised. Lech Wałęsa, the first chairman of Solidarność became president of Poland in 1990 and many trade union members held government offices and seats in Parliament and on management boards of big state-owned companies. As a result, Solidarność gained enormous influence, but as a trade union simultaneously lost most of its leaders to politics. This led to a loss of authority of Solidarność as an institution representing workers' interests and separated it away from its grass roots members. In the parliamentary elections in 1997 one of the parties running for parliament was the Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS), a political party coalition gathered around Solidarność. It consisted of 20 small parties and 16 further groupings. AWS became by far the biggest party with almost 34 per cent of valid votes and gained 201 seats in the Sejm (out of 460), as well as 51 out of 100 seats in the Senate and thus had the absolute majority in the second chamber of the Polish parliament. Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek as well as most of the AWS ministers came from the trade union. The trade union's chairman Marian Krzaklewski (from February 1991 until September 2002) was simultaneously chairman of the AWS and its parliamentary grouping in the Sejm. His most important collaborators came from the trade union's National Commission and took part in negotiations even when they were not members of parliament. Consequently, Krzaklewski – as chairman of the trade union, of the party and of the parliamentary grouping – and the members of the trade union's National Commission became an extra-parliamentary centre of influence. The 'rule of trade unions' ended in the year 2001. Due to conflicts within the party and accusations of corruption AWS became unattractive and weak in the eyes of the electorate. In the parliamentary elections of 2001 it did not manage to get over the legal hurdle of 8 per cent of votes for electoral coalitions and since then has not had a single parliamentarian in the Sejm. Now came the time of the coalition of the Left led by the 'Democratic Left Alliance' (SLD), where many parliamentarians came from OPZZ. In 2005 'Law and Justice', a party very near to Solidarność, and its partners removed the Left Alliance which was related to OPZZ. After the September 2005 and October 2007 elections seven parliamentarians from the OPZZ still belonged to left alliances. The structural reforms of the nineties lead to the impoverishment of certain parts of the society, to dismissals and growing unemployment, for which not only the government but also the trade unions were blamed. Their direct engagement in Polish politics had produced negative effects. Due to their participation in less than pristine governments trade unions almost forfeited their reputation and support. Nevertheless, a large part of the leaders and members believe until today that in order to achieve something in politics one has to use one's own people. The trade union Solidarność openly favours the 'Law and Justice' party PiS. During the presidential elections in 2005 it intensively called on the electorate to vote for PiS candidate Lech Kaczyński. The weekly newspaper 'Tygodnik Solidarność' constantly supported the policy of PiS which governed from 2005 to 2007 with the rural interest party Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland (Samoobrona) and the extreme right-wing League of Polish Families (LPR). Even the hitherto neutral Trade Unions Forum was close to getting involved with political parties. In June 2005 its board decided to sign an agreement with the populist Samoobrona. However, already in August 2005 FZZ annulled this agreement, because Samoobrona did not grant FZZ the promised places on the electoral lists for the parliamentary elections in 2005.  Current situation of Polish trade unions  The landscape of Polish trade unions is shaped by three national umbrella organisations, many autonomous organisations on the local level (i.e. 'Sierpien 80', Solidarnosc 80, etc.) as well as independent trade unions in individual plants and firms. All Polish trade unions accept the social market economy, parliamentary democracy and European unification. All trade unions, including NSZZ Solidarnosc, used their old structures to deal with new tasks and challenges during the transformation period after 1989. Despite numerous attempts at reforms all umbrella organisations, as well as most sector unions, suffer because of these dysfunctional structures. Reform of structures has become a magic formula present at all congresses and in programmatic documents in many variations, but that does not result in any significant changes. Although they support political reforms, trade unions are conservative and resistant to reform when it comes to their own organisational structures and finances. The structure of the sector organisations reflects the Polish state-owned economic structures from the beginning of the eighties and not the realities of today's globalised market economy and precarious labour markets. The borders of local structures often do not follow the local government reorganisations which have taken place in the meantime. NSZZ Solidarnosc, founded in 1980 and again in 1989, consists of 37 regions and 16 affiliated sectoral unions. Since September 2002 its leader is Janusz Sniadek. OPZZ was established in 1984 and consists of 90 craft unions grouped in 9 sector committees and of 16 regional boards in voivodeships. Since May 2004 its leader is Jan Guz. FZZ Forum was established in 2002, consists of 77 craft unions grouped in 8 branches and is led by Wieslaw Siewierski. The Catholic Church and particularly the admiration of the Polish pope John Paul II. have profoundly shaped NSZZ Solidarnosc. During the 20th National Congress of Solidarnosc in summer 2006 typically there was an appeal in memory of pope John Paul II. During the first visit of pope Benedict XVI strikes in health care and in other sectors in the whole country were stopped in order not to disturb the distinguished guest and to enable members of the Solidarnosc to participate in the services with the pope. NSZZ Solidarnosc, OPZZ and FZZ Forum together have about 1.9 million members. It is supposed that a further 200.000 members belong to small independent trade unions. Statistics are rarely published and are extremely difficult to prepare anyway, due to the huge fragmentation and insufficient links between organisational levels. The overwhelming part of the basic trade unions are 'plant social clubs' or even 'functional groups' for administration, sales, logistics, foremen, technicians, etc. Some of those 'plant social clubs' function only in their own departments or sites and know only little about trade union work in other locations of the enterprise. Cooperation in trade union networks for entire enterprises and groups of companies is only an exception and takes place with foreign, often German help. The EU- inspired Law on Information and Consultation, passed on 7 April 2006, slowly contributes to changing this situation by means of the creation of \\"Employees Councils\\". The degree of unionization is still exceptionally high in the mining industry, in the metallurgical industry, the railways and in education. Trade unions are present in all state owned mines. Apart from two large trade mining unions affiliated to Solidarnosc and OPZZ, there are independent unions of occupational groups. The degree of unionisation depends on the mine and lies between 70 and 90 per cent. However, in 97 per cent of all establishments in the country there are no trade unions, especially not in small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs). On the other hand, in the business segment where there are employees' organisations there are over 23.000 trade unions as legal entities and over 300 industry-wide organisations which aspire to be national confederations of trade unions. All of them are properly registered with the courts. Individual membership in sector unions or nationwide confederations do not exist. The reason for this multitude and variety is a law which imposes only a few numerical limits to the establishment of employee organisations. It takes only 10 employees to register a trade union foundation committee. Enterprises with over five or even over a dozen trade unions are not rare. The record belongs to an establishment with 210 employees and 17 trade unions. Within many firms trade unions cooperate between themselves. Yet it also happens that unions negotiate and sign collective agreements with the employer behind each other's backs. Even many of the enterprise unions of Solidarnosc do not at the same time belong to sector or craft unions but only to the nationwide association. Trade unions, if they exist, are generally strongest on the plant or site level where the collection of membership dues takes place. The majority of union funds is also spent on this level. The most transparent finances are those of Solidarnosc. Membership subscriptions are distributed as follows: 60 per cent go to the Plant/Site Commission, 25 per cent to the Regional Board, 8 per cent to the National Commission (umbrella organisation), 5 per cent to the strike fund and 2 per cent to the sector union. OPZZ and FZZ Forum also have great problems with financing their activities. In both cases a part of subscriptions of 7-cent per month and member goes to central offices. This is by far not enough to keep the work of the umbrella organisations on a sufficiently high level. During the last few years especially Solidarnosc and OPZZ were forced to cut down on costs by closing offices and reducing staff. OPZZ seems to be in a better material situation than Solidarnosc, as it took over the larger part of the properties of trade unions dating from before 1989 (urban office properties, sanatoriums and holiday homes) and thus for years functioned on the basis of earnings from renting and leasing them. Some affiliated unions of OPZZ and Forum have similar financial sources as they have their own properties. Until now the cooperation between trade unions and organisations of civil society was somewhat limited. The generally conservative trade unions are often wary or even mistrustful towards consumer or environmental organisations which follow other aims and sometimes represent contradictory interests. Polish trade unions are also often unable to react to new challenges in good time. Other non-governmental organisations usually react quicker. Some important phenomena of today's labour market like gender questions, mobbing, interest protection of employees mistreated in big chain stores, temporary work or subcontracted labour became topics of the public debate thanks to civil society, the media and ad hoc socio- political associations. Trade unions initially often showed reserve towards new challenges, and they don't represent the precariously employed and the unemployed anyway. Employee councils were established for the first time by the act of 7 April 2006. This act is the implementation of the EU directive establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees of 11 March 2002. The new employee councils have no rights of co- determination of decisions of management. Where there are no trade unions employee councils may become a preliminary stage to the establishment of trade union organisations in the firms.  International connections of the Polish trade unions  Since 1986 the NSZZ Solidarnosc belonged to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU, since November 2006 ITUC) and to the World Confederation of Labour (WCL, which in November 2006 became a part of the ITUC), since 1995 to the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), and since 1997 to the Trade Union Advisory Committee of the 'Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development' (TUAC/OECD). The affiliated unions of the NSZZ Solidarnosc usually belong to the branch offices of the ETUC. OPZZ belonged from 1984 till 1991 to the communist-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) in Prague. From 1991 till 1997 OPZZ reduced its status to observer. In March 2006 it joined the European Trade Union Confederation after the long-standing quarrel with Solidarnosc concerning real estate was settled. The biggest trade union in the country, the OPZZ member ZNP, belonged to the teachers' federations of the ICFTU as well as of the WCL. Many other affiliated unions of the OPZZ also belong to the sector branch structures of the ETUC and the ITUC for a long time. Among these are printers, the building branch, forestry, agriculture, mining, chemistry, energy and some public services. Since September 2003 the FZZ Forum is a member of the Confederation of Free Trade Unions (Federation of Civil Servants CESI).

It is located in the village of Brummana, situated in Metn, Mount Lebanon, east of the capital city Beirut. Brummana High School Brummana High School, circa 1886. This school was established in 1873, by the Quaker Theophilus Waldmeier (a Swiss missionary). Historically Quakers were among the pioneers in developing a modern form of learner-centred education which prized the worth and development of the whole child and student. With other educators, Quakers recognised that schooling involved far more than academic study. Today much internationally accepted good practice in education follows these principles. BHS remains a school which aims to follow the ideals and values of its Quaker founders. Brummana High School has been licensed and accredited by the Lebanese Ministry of Education to be a coeducational, boarding and day school for students in the classes of the infant, primary, intermediate and secondary schools in 1947.(No. 421/April 24, 1947)  History  Theophilus Waldmeier, a German-Swiss missionary, first came to Mount Lebanon in 1867, during the time of the Ottoman rule, and was engaged as inspector of branch schools in Beirut, the mountains, and Damascus. Some time between 1869 and 1874, Elijah G. Saleeby opened the first school in Brummana, a remote village overlooking Beirut (three hours from Beirut on horseback), called the \\"Darlington Station\\" because it was backed with Quaker (Religious Society of Friends) subscriptions from Darlington, England. In 1873, Theophilus Waldmeier opened a girls' school in Brummana, with money sent to him by his friends in Switzerland. Before the end of the year he was sent further money from Switzerland to open a boys' school at Brummana. Many of the buildings of Brummana date to the time period; they were made of local stone and red tile. In 1874, Theophilus Waldmeier visited England to raise money for the school from the Society of Friends, and he himself became a Quaker. When he returned, he purchased 20,000 square yards of land called \\"Berket al-Ghanem\\" (The Pool of the Conqueror) which was a hillside of pine, fig, and mulberry trees with two fountains of water on the edge of Brummana. The Friends' Syrian Mission (a committee of English and American Friends) approved the purchase and authorised the building of a boys' school. In this same year, Elijah G. Saleeby handed over the \\"Darlington Station\\" school to Theophilus Waldmeier. In 1876, the Boys' Training Home (now Brummana High School) was opened in a leased house in Brummana until the new building was ready. The land name was changed from \\"Berket al-Ghanem\\" to \\"Ayn al-Salam\\" (The Fountain of Peace). Within five years, the school had grown to 300 students, bringing literacy and new ideas to the isolated mountain area. When in 1878 the new Boy's Training Home building came into use, it housed the only dispensary in Mount Lebanon. As the medical work increased, in 1881 alternative accommodation was found in an old silk factory which was converted into a hospital with 15 beds on the ground floor and a dispensary and outpatient accommodation in the upper storey. In 1882, the Girls' Training Home at Brummana was opened. Education at Brummana High School was based on the principles of the Society of Friends, which stress non-violence, equality, the spirit of service and encouragement of the pursuit of higher standards through enlightened methods. In 1889, the village of Brummana was linked by a new carriage road down the hill to Beirut below, but many students still arrived at the school gates by foot or donkey. At the turn of the century, BHS built the first tennis court in the Middle East. By 1902, the Boys' Training Home had adopted the name Boys' High School. During that year, BHS became co- educational. It was one of the few fully co-educational schools. When in 1914 World War I began, the Ottomans took over the school hospital and occupied the school buildings which were not re-opened until 1919. Despite the famine relief operation set up in the school's kitchens, approximately 400 out of 2000 Brummana villagers died in the great famine of 1915-18 (compared to 50% of the population of Lebanon). After the war, Lebanon was put under French mandate, and two decades of peace and prosperity followed. In 1928, new classrooms were constructed, in 1930, a new hospital pavilion to accommodate 36 beds was completed, and in 1936, the BHS Old Scholars Association was set up. World War II began in 1939, and when Hitler occupied France in 1940, Lebanon came under the Vichy Government, until the Allies freed it in 1941. The Second World War seriously affected the life of the school. The French followed by the British took over the school hospital. The British made the school their military headquarters for a year. Despite the war, the school stayed open with 22 boarders and 100 day students. Lebanon became independent in 1943, and during the peace of the next three decades, the school's reputation for excellence and friendly diversity became known throughout the entire region. BHS grew to 750 students, nearly half of them boarders. The school pursued a balanced program for mind and bodies and this culminated in the following: *1950 - A new swimming pool *1952 - A new Primary block *1953 - The first international tennis tournament *1960 - A new craft block for woodwork and metal work *1967 - A new boarding house opened by HRH Duke of Edinburgh *1971 - A new health centre - Clare House *1973 - New science labs Around the 1960s and 1970s the school's curriculum was mainly in the English language. The school's athletics programme placed emphasis on basketball, volleyball, track, and tennis. The students consisted of Arab and children of Western expatriates from across the Middle East, with members of the Bahraini, Jordanian, UAE and Saudi royal families, with a small smattering of American and British nationals. The parents of the America and European students worked in Lebanon. Most students go on to the American University of Beirut for their further studies. In 1975, when war once again overtook Lebanon, this period of growth ended and the school lost many of its boarders, staff, and day students. In 1985, the British Quakers turned the management of the school over to a local Board who kept the educational program alive throughout difficult times, as well as taking in refugees and keeping out militia. Brummana High School was founded by Theophilus Waldmeier, a Swiss missionary, who came to Lebanon in 1872 and who later became a Quaker and joined the Society of Friends. The Society of Friends arose in the mid 17th century in England from a religious experience of George Fox. The School is owned by the Friends Service Council in London and operated by a local Management Committee. The principal and many teachers were of British nationality and members of the Society of Friends. The education provided by the School was based on principles as understood by the Society of Friends, which stress lack of involvement in political activity, lack of discrimination, no acknowledgment of national or racial divisions and promotion of the spirit of service. In 1985, the Society of Friends totally withdrew from the School operation and handed the responsibilities to the Brummana High School Cultural Society, composed of old B.H.S. former students. Since that date, the B.H.S.-C.S. has been totally and independently responsible for the School. Peace returned, and in 1998, at the request of the parents, staff, and old scholars, the British Quakers resumed management of the school, working through a new local Board to begin the process of post-war development. In 1999, the school commissioned a major educational study as the basis for a five-year development plan. The Science Block was extended to three floors, and the Science Block and Upper School Computer Laboratory were completely refurbished and fully re-equipped. In 2004, Rizkhallah House was fully refurbished to house the Infant Section and the Main Teaching Block roof was replaced. Thanks to the generous donations of old scholars, parents, and friends of the school, the process of renewal is continuing.  Scouts  Brummana High School houses one of the oldest Scouts groups in Lebanon, Brummana One Group, or Br1, founded in 1952. Br1's mission is to contribute to the education of young people based on non-formal education.

It was approximately north-east of Komańcza, south of Bukowsko, and south of the regional capital Rzeszów. Zawadka Morochowska (or Bukowska, 1876) appears on records as early as the year 1567. It was a small Rusyn-Wallachian village on either side of the Boroniec stream. The population as of 1936 was 328. In 1939, there were 49 farms. As of January 1945, there were said to be 425 Ukrainians there. The Greek Catholic Church of the Circumcision of Our Lord was built there in 1856. It was a filial church of the church in nearby Morochów, which is much older. The village generally endured through World War II until 1944. This village was the subject of repression by the Soviet- sponsored Polish Army in early 1946 as part of the campaign to eliminate suspected support for the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA).3,000 in Rebel Band Terrorize Galicia In January, 1946, a unit of Polish communist soldiers came into the area, and launched offenses against Bukowica, Ratnawica, and Zboiska, among other places. They were searching for an alleged 800 UPA members led by \\"Ren\\". They attempted to engage the UPA forces near Zawadka Morochowska, and in the process of the search, massacred dozens of the village's residents including men, women and children. This massacre was followed by at least two additional massacres in March 1946. Residents who remained alive by 1947 were deported to the Western territories that Poland had acquired through the Yalta conference. A memorial to the victims of the Zawadka massacre stands in the cemetery, near the mass graves that hold the victims' bodies. The parish birth record of Zawadka Morochowska (1784–1890) and the death record of Zawadka Morochowska (1784–1943) are at the Meeting of the Lord Orthodox Church in Morochów.

It blocks two potassium channel subtypes; voltage-gated and calcium-activated channels. Etymology Coba is a region in Mexico where the Centruroides noxius scorpion is found. Sources Cobatoxin 1 and 2 are both found in the venom of the Centruroides noxius scorpion. Chemistry =Structure= Cobatoxin is a 32-residue toxin with 3 disulfide bridges, which are located on C1-C4, C2-C5 and C3- C6 (Cys3-Cys22, Cys8-Cys27, and Cys12-Cys29). The peptide backbone is folded according to an α/β scaffold, both α-helical and two- stranded β-sheet structures are present. Cobatoxin 1 has a rod-like shape due to an extended N-terminus. =Family= Cobatoxin 1 and 2 both belong to the α-KTx family. The α-KTx family is part of the K+-channel-specific scorpion toxins (KTx), which consists of 3 families; α, β, and γ. These 3 families differ in structure. Target Cobatoxin 1 and 2 both block the Kv1.1 K+-channels in mice and the Shaker B K+ channels in insects, which are voltage-dependent K+-channels (Selisko, 1998). Other voltage-dependent K+-channels that are blocked by Cobatoxin 1 are the Kv1.2 K+-channels in rats and Kv1.3 K+-channels in mice. Cobatoxin 1 also blocks the IKCa1 Ca2+-activated K+-channel. Mode of action Cobatoxin 1 is a pore-blocking toxin. The interaction between cobatoxin 1 and the Kv1.2 channel is first esthablished by four salt bridges, which are formed between side chains of the four Kv1.2 α-subunits and amino acids residues of cobatoxin 1. This way a stable complex is formed, named the toxin-ring. Next, a tighter interaction is formed by a hydrophobic interaction between cobatoxin 1 and the α-subunit. Then the Lys21 side chain of cobatoxin 1 blocks the pore by entering the P-domain of the ion channel, which is the selectivity filter. Toxicity The of cobatoxin 1 after intracerebroventricular injection in mice is 500±45 ng.

Radomyśl was a town from 1558 to 1935. In the early days of Polish statehood, the area of Radomyśl belonged to the Duchy of Sandomierz, which later became Sandomierz Voivodeship. In 1474, Lublin Voivodeship was created out of its eastern part, and Radomyśl belonged to this province until 1772 (see Partitions of Poland), when it was annexed by Austria, together with whole Galicia. Radomyśl nad Sanem itself was founded as a private village in 1556, by a local nobleman Jakub Sienienski. Two years later, King Zygmunt August granted it a town charter (Magdeburg rights), and in 1584, King Stefan Batory gave permission for an annual fair and weekly markets, organized on each Monday.

Lp-PLA2 is a 45-kDa protein of 441 amino acids. It is one of several PAF acetylhydrolases.  Function  In the blood Lp-PLA2 travels mainly with low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Less than 20% is associated with high-density lipoprotein HDL. Several lines of evidence suggest that HDL-associated Lp-PLA2 may substantially contribute to the HDL antiatherogenic activities. It is an enzyme produced by inflammatory cells and hydrolyzes oxidized phospholipids in LDL. Lp-PLA2 is platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase (EC 3.1.1.47), a secreted enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of PAF to inactive products by hydrolysis of the acetyl group at the sn-2 position, producing the biologically inactive products LYSO-PAF and acetate.  Clinical significance  Lp-PLA2 is involved in the development of atherosclerosis, an observation that has prompted interest as a possible therapeutic target (see, e.g. the investigational drug Darapladib). In human atherosclerotic lesions, 2 main sources of Lp-PLA2 can be identified, including that which is brought into the intima bound to LDL (from the circulation), and that which is synthesized de novo by plaque inflammatory cells (macrophages, T cells, mast cells).\\" It is used as a marker for cardiac disease. A meta-analysis involving a total of 79,036 participants in 32 prospective studies found that Lp-PLA2 levels are positively correlated with increased risk of developing coronary heart disease and stroke.

Bror Emil Hildebrand (22February 1806 in Madesjö30August 1884) was a Swedish archaeologist, numismatist and museum director. From 1837 to 1879 he was Custodian of Ancient Monuments and Secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters. From 1847 he was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and from 1866 a member of the Swedish Academy. In 1866, he founded the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm. In 1830 Hildebrand became reader in numismatics at the University of Lund. About this time he was also taught archaeology by C.J. Thomsen in nearby Copenhagen: thus Hildebrand introduced the three-age system to Sweden. His main scholarly legacy lies within the field of Medieval Anglo-Saxon numismatics, where he produced pioneering catalogues and studies. Much of this work was indirectly due to agricultural reforms in Sweden that led to Viking Period silver coin hoards surfacing at a rate never seen before or after Hildebrand's day; the 1864 edition of Hildebrand's Anglo-Saxon coins in the Swedish Royal Coin Cabinet drew on the evidence of 64 Swedish hoards alongside other European finds to establish the basic chronology of the late Anglo-Saxon coinage, much of which has remained valid after more than a century of subsequent research. Hildebrand was the father of archaeologist Hans Hildebrand and teacher both to him and to archaeologist Oscar Montelius.

Likewise, if a sheet 10 or 20 postal cards is typeset, the variations of the letters or design elements may allow reconstruction or plating of the sheets based on these differences.Littrell, Robert, Ed.; Postal Cards of Spanish Colonial Cuba, Philippines and Puerto Rico, UPSS (2010). Basics Four of ten (printed 2x5) possible types shown in this partial plating of the 1896 Cuban postal cards. The full 4 centavos card is shown as well. For plating to be possible, there must be constant variants in details of the stamps printed from a single plate or lithographic stone so that one can identify the exact original position of each stamp. Evidence that may be used in plating includes defects or \\"flaws\\" occurring in the transfer of images, individual touch-ups by the engraver, recuttings of the plates, repairs, and accidental injuries to the plates. In addition, stamps may have been laid out in an irregular fashion on the plate with the result that differences in spacing and orientation of the stamps may be used to determine their plate positions. From their inception in 1840 until 1884, postage stamps from Great Britain incorporated control letters in the corners indicating the stamps's exact position on the sheet, e.g., A...C is first row, third stamp, and for a period also incorporated the number of the plate from which the stamps were printed. Other evidence such as color of the ink used or watermarks in the paper may be of use in reconstructing plates.Stanley Gibbons, Great Britain, Specialised Stamp Catalogue, Vol. 1: Queen Victoria (8th ed. 1985), p. 33 ff. In the absence of such evidence, plating is not possible. Because of the highly accurate methods of modern stamp production, most modern issues cannot be plated. Classic issues Philatelists have made extensive efforts in plating many of the Nineteenth Century Classic postage stamp issues and have written a number of books on plating different stamp issues. One of the greatest philatelic achievements is the plating of the Penny Black and its succeeding Penny Red Brown stamps issued beginning in 1840. Those stamps were printed in sheets of 240 stamps. The plates would wear as printing went on and were often replaced. Beginning with the 71st plate of Die II in 1858, the plate number was inconspicuously engraved on the stamps themselves. All the stamps bore control letters which indicated the exact position on the sheet, so that reconstructing the plates beginning with plate 71 is simply a matter of finding the necessary stamps. The stamps printed from the first 70 plates of Die II and all the plates from Die I [over 200], however, bore no numbers to indicate the specific plate used to print them, and their plating presented vastly greater problems. Through painstaking study of the stamps, philatelists were able to reconstruct most or all of the first Die II's 70 plates. Later philatelists were assisted when reference copies and high quality photographs of the original panes kept by the British Government were made available for inspection. The other early engraved stamp issues of Great Britain have similarly been plated. In contrast, plates of other classic stamps were relatively easy to reconstruct. One of the easiest was the stamps of Corrientes, which were individually crudely engraved so that the differences between the stamps are obvious to a non-expert.See Louis Stich, Corrientes: the Issues from 1856-80, The Collectors Club, New York, 1957. Early stamps of Mauritius have been used to reconstruct a series of original panes printed from plates displaying increasing states of wear, from early (stamps bold and clear) to late (stamps very light and weak)David Feldman SA, Mauritius: Classic Postage Stamps and Postal History, Switzerland (1993), illustrated auction catalog with Supplement providing detailed information on plating positions of the \\"Post Paid\\" and \\"Lapirot\\" issues in their different states.

She was a member of Queen Mother Catherine de' Medici's notorious \\"Flying Squadron\\" (L'escadron volant in French), a group of beautiful female spies and informants recruited to seduce important men at Court, and thereby extract information to pass on to the Queen Mother.Strage, Mark (1976). Women of Power: The Life and Times of Catherine de Medici. New York and London: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. p.185.  Biography  Charlotte was born in France on 26 October 1551, the daughter and only child of Jacques de Beaune, Baron Semblançay, Viscount of Tours, and Gabrielle de Sade, a descendant of Provençal nobility. The family seat was in the former province of Touraine. Her great-grandfather, Jacques de Beaune was a superintendent of finance to King Francis I who ordered his execution in 1527 at the instigation of his mother, Louise of Savoy. Charlotte later succeeded her father to the barony of Semblançay and the viscounty of Tours. Charlotte was sent to court where she was educated in the household of the Queen Mother, Catherine de' Medici. Blonde-haired,Seward, Desmond (1976). The Bourbon kings of France. London: Constable. p.12 and described as having been \\"beautiful, intelligent, and immoral\\", she was married to Simon de Fizes, Baron de Sauve, secretary of state first to King Charles IX and afterwards King Henry III, in 1569 when she was eighteen years old. Her marriage was arranged by the powerful Guise family.Ladurie, Emmanuel Le Roy (1977). The Peasants of Languedoc. University of Illinois Press. p.178 In the words of historian Jean Heritier, her background meant that \\"at twenty-one, she knew all there was to be known about politics\\".Heritier, Jean. Catherine de' Medici, translated by Charlotte Haldane, London: George Allen and Unwin, 1963, OCLC 1678642, p. 306. Charlotte's alleged beauty has been contradicted by author Mark Strage who instead described Charlotte as having had a face that was \\"more agreeable and animated than sensuous\\". She was appointed maid-of- honour to Marguerite de Valois. She is recorded as taking part in some of the extravagant pageants and ballets which Catherine de' Medici produced in abundance. She helped Catherine mount an outdoor banquet and lavish show depicting the Apotheosis of Woman on 9 June 1577 at the château of Chenonceau. During the banquet the male guests were served by Catherine's most beautiful ladies-in-waiting who wore topless gowns and their hair flowing loose as was the custom of brides on their wedding night.Heritier, p.362.Strage, p.209 On 27 November 1579 her husband died. Charlotte married secondly on 18 October 1584, Francois de La Tremoille, Marquis de Noirmoutier and gave birth to a son, Louis de La Tremoille in 1586. In 1608, Louis would succeed his father as Marquis de Noirmoutier. On 13 March 1610, he married Lucrèce Bouhier, by whom he had a son, Louis de La Tremoille, 1st Duke of Noirmoutier (25 December 1612 – 12 October 1666). A notable descendant of Charlotte was Marie-Anne de la Trémoille, Princesse des Ursins. Catherine de' Medici formed the notorious group of female informants known as the \\"Flying Squadron\\", of which Charlotte de Sauve was a member Flying Squadron Shortly after Henry of Navarre's marriage to Catherine's daughter Marguerite de Valois in 1572, Catherine recruited Charlotte to her elite group of beautiful female spies and informants known as the \\"Flying Squadron\\" (L'escadron volant) and she quickly became one of its \\"most accomplished members\\". The Queen Mother's purpose in inviting Charlotte to join the group was for the latter to seduce Navarre, become his confidante as well as mistress, and thus extract information which she would duly pass on to Catherine who would subsequently use it as political leverage. The \\"Flying Squadron\\" had a male counterpart in \\"Les Mignons\\". Charlotte quickly became Navarre's mistress and exerted a strong influence over him. His wife Marguerite recorded in her memoirs: \\"Mme de Sauve so completely ensnared my husband that we no longer slept together, not even conversed\\". She accused de Sauve (\\"that Circe\\") of persuading Henry that she was jealous of de Sauve, with the result that Henry, whose affairs Marguerite had allowed, stopped confiding in her.Haldane, Charlotte (1968). Queen of Hearts: Marguerite of Valois, 1553–1615. London: Constable. OCLC 460242, pp. 80–81; Mémoires de Marguerite de Valois, edited by Yves Cazaux, Paris: Mercure de France, 1986, , p. 79. Charlotte de Sauve has been credited as a source of the information that led to the execution of Marguerite de Valois's lover Joseph Boniface de La Môle and Annibal de Coconnas for engaging in a conspiracy to overthrow the gravely ill Charles IX and the Queen Mother in 1574 with the assistance of Huguenot troops.Haldane, pp. 71–72.Strage, p.186 In 1575, Catherine de' Medici, abetted by her son Henry III, instructed Charlotte to seduce the king's brother, her youngest son, François, Duke of Alençon, with the aim of provoking hostility between the two young men, so that they would not conspire together in the future.Frieda, Leonie (2005). Catherine de Medici. London: Phoenix. P.379. Charlotte subsequently became the duke's mistress, creating a rift between the former close friends, as Navarre and Alençon became rivals over Charlotte. According to Marguerite's memoirs: \\"Charlotte de Sauve treated both of them [Navarre and Alençon] in such a way that they became extremely jealous of each other, to such a point that they forgot their ambitions, their duties and their plans and thought of nothing but chasing after this woman\\". Henry of Navarre wrote to a friend: \\"The court is the strangest I have ever known. We are nearly always ready to cut each other's throat ... All the band you know wants my death on account of my love for Monsieur [Alençon] and they have forbidden for the third time my mistress [Charlotte de Sauve] to speak to me. They have such a hold on her that she does not dare look at me. I am waiting for a minor battle, for they say they will kill me, and I want to be one jump ahead of them\\".Knecht, R. J. (1998). Catherine de' Medici. London: Longman. p.181. On one occasion, Henry III had Alençon's papers searched for evidence of political plotting but turned up only a declaration of love from Madame de Sauve.Frieda, p. 395. Ball at the court of Henry III, c. 1582 In the autumn of 1578, she was recorded as having been one of the three hundred members of the court which accompanied Catherine and Marguerite on a royal progress to the Kingdom of Navarre where the latter was reunited with her husband who had returned to his kingdom two years earlier. However, instead of resuming his love affair with Charlotte, Navarre's interest was caught by Victoria de Ayala, a beautiful Spanish girl and a recent recruit to the \\"Flying Squadron\\".Strage, p.217 Charlotte de Sauve later became the mistress of Navarre's greatest adversary, Henry I, Duke of Guise, with whom she spent the night at Blois on 22 December 1588, before his assassination by \\"the Forty-five\\", Henry III's bodyguards, the following morning.Frieda, p. 439.Strage, p.277 She had other lovers, including the Duc d'Épernon and the Seigneur d'Avrilly. Later years and death She appears again in 1599 when she was called upon as a witness in the annulment proceedings of Henry of Navarre (who had succeeded to the French throne as Henry IV in 1589) and Marguerite, who had proved to be sterile. Henry wished to annul his marriage in order to marry Marie de' Medici and sire an heir. Charlotte testified that Marguerite had been forced to marry Henry by Charles IX and the Queen Mother swearing that Catherine had threatened Marguerite that \\"if she did not consent to this marriage, she would make her the most miserable woman in the kingdom\\". The annulment was granted on 17 December 1599 leaving King Henry free to wed Marie de' Medici by whom he had six legitimate royal offspring, including his heir Louis.Strage, p.294 Charlotte died on 30 September 1617 less than a month before her sixty-sixth birthday.  In film  The role of Charlotte de Sauve was played by Italian actress Asia Argento in the 1994 film La Reine Margot starring Isabelle Adjani in the title role. In the film the character dies while unknowingly trying to poison Henry of Navarre. Charlotte is also portrayed in season one episode seventeen of The CW's television show Reign on by actress Amy Groening.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Czudec. It lies in Lesser Poland, approximately north-east of Strzyżów and south-west of the regional capital Rzeszów. The village has a population of 2,900, and has a rail station on the secondary-importance line from Rzeszów to Jasło. The history of Czudec dates back to the year 1185, when Mikołaj Bogoria from the town of Bogoria near Sandomierz granted a number of Lesser Poland’s villages to the newly established Koprzywnica Cistercian abbey. Among those villages was Czudec. In 1263 in Tarnów, Lesser Poland’s prince Bolesław V the Chaste met with Daniel of Galicia, to establish a border between the two states. According to their agreement, Czudec was to remain within Lesser Poland, while nearby Rzeszów belonged to Red Ruthenia. On September 11, 1427, King Władysław Jagiełło granted Magdeburg rights town charter to Czudec. The new town was permitted to have one fair a week, and to create several guilds. Until 1610, Czudec belonged to the Strzyżowski family. The town then passed into the hands of the Grabieński family (Pomian coat of arms), which owned it until 1840. Until 1772, Czudec belonged to Pilzno County of Sandomierz Voivodeship. After the Partitions of Poland, it was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and from 1772 to 1918, belonged to the province of Galicia. In the 19th century the town declined, as its artisans could not compete with modern industry. Finally, in 1935, the government of the Second Polish Republic stripped Czudec of the town charter; it has remained a village ever since. Points of interest: * Baroque Holy Trinity parish church (1721–1735), built from stone of the ruined Czudec Castle, * St. Martin roadside chapel (1692), * a 17th-century manor house called Lamus, together with a park, * wooden houses in the market square, * ruins of the medieval Czudec Castle. The ruins are located on a hill called Góra Zamkowa, at the Wislok river. In 1938 and 1954, archaeologists found here several examples of Gothic brick walls. The castle dates back to the early years of Polish history, when it was a gord, guarding southeastern border of Lesser Poland. In the 14th century, a wooden complex was built, which was remodeled in Renaissance style in the 16th century. In 1657, during the Swedish invasion of Poland, the castle was destroyed by Transilvanian army of George II Rakoczi. The image of the castle was presented on the official seal of Czudec, in the period when it was a town (1427–1935).

Dope test Dard was riding for Peugeot in 1976. Maurice De Muer was the manager, Bernard Thévenet the star rider and François Bellocq the doctor. At the start of that year the team rode L'Étoile des Espoirs, a stage race in south-west France. Jean-Luc Vandenbroucke was race leader and Dard, his teammate, had won the stage to Dax. Dard and a further teammate, Bourreau, were called for a dope test. Both were caught trying to defraud the control with a condom of untainted urine in their shorts to give the impression they were urinating.Wielerrevue, the Netherlands, De Koerier van Dax, undated cutting Dard, it was reported, left the control room and then realised that his place in the race, perhaps his team, were over before the season had properly started. He found the doctor, Bruno Chaumont, and begged him not to report the positive. Chaumont agreed to burn the reports. Dard then realised that while there may be no positive report, the absence of a report meant there had been no test either. He would have to explain why Chaumont had returned to the French federation with two empty bottles identified as his. Bourreau had accepted his guilt and didn't want to take it further. But Dard is said to have gone back to the test centre for the empty bottles. But Chaumont had left by train to Paris. Dard got a lift to the station with another Peugeot rider, Bernard Croyet. They arrived just as Chaumont's train left for Paris. The two ran back to their car and drove across France to get to Paris before him. They reached Austerlitz station in time to meet Chaumont on the platform. Dard begged until tears ran down his face, literally. And again Chaumont relented. He took out the two bottles and smashed them. Dard (see below) disputes the story. Chaumont said: > That evening, I took the train with the empty test bottles closed with > seals. There was no question of taking samples from the riders because they > had cheated. The next morning, at Austerlitz station in Paris, at 6.30am, > who do I see?

Dard now had nothing more to lose, so he too went to L'Équipe and spilled the inside story, right down to providing the prescriptions for dope that Bellocq, the team doctor, had given him.L'Équipe, 22 November 1976 He said riders treated with cortisone and steroids were now in \\"a pitiful state\\".de Mondenard, Jean-Pierre, Dictionnaire du Dopage, Masson, France Row A row then broke out between Dard and the doctor. Dard said: To which the doctor replied: > His attitude is incredible [c'est fabuleux, une pareille attitude].

The story, however, also appears in a book by the team doctor, Bellocq, who died aged 47 in 1993 and was a believer in cortisone as a treatment for racing cyclists.Cyclisme Dopage - Memoire by Dr Bellocq, Tour de France doctor Bernard Thévenet accused him of ruining his career. Aftermath Bellocq was banned from working for the French federation, although he continued to work for teams. Chaumont, too, was disciplined by the Fédération Française de Cyclisme. The doping historian, Dr Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, named Peugeot's manager, Maurice de Muer, as the \\"gold medallist\\" in doping in cycling. > \\"You'd be hard-pushed to count how many doping affairs [Maurice de Muer] has > been involved with... at the head of Bic, then Peugeot.

Plot Darla has had a tonsillectomy, and the gang, announcing themselves as \\"Third Ward Sunshine Spredders Club\\", go to the hospital to pay her a visit. They bring with them a large picnic basket full of food that they know Darla can't eat, intending to eat it all themselves after Darla refuses it. When the kids make it to Darla's room in the children's ward, Spanky assigns Alfalfa to stay outside and guard the picnic basket until they're sure Darla's still too sick to eat any of it. While waiting, however, Alfalfa falls for the scheme of another resident of the children's ward—a boy intending to escape from his own tonsillectomy. He offers Alfalfa a dime to change clothes with him while he \\"goes for a little walk\\", leaving Alfalfa to fend for himself when an orderly comes to collect him for the tonsil operation. While in the elevator, little Gary, who has stowed away aboard the gurney on which the orderly is transporting Alfalfa, opens a canister of laughing gas, sending himself, Alfalfa, the orderly, and even the elevator operator into various fits of mirth and odd behavior. Spanky, Porky, Buckwheat, and Leonard do their best to try to catch Alfalfa, who, thanks to the laughing gas, is now romping deliriously through the hospital and causing havoc and mischief. When Spanky and the boys finally manage to drag Alfalfa back into Darla's room, a still tipsy Alfalfa hops on her bed and jumps for the chandelier, finally calming down after falling to the floor and knocking a pitcher of water off the dresser and onto his head. Just before finally diving into their picnic, a nurse arrives to deliver Darla's afternoon dish of ice cream (ice cream being the only food she can eat at the moment). The nurse also offers the six boys dishes of ice cream as well, and when she leaves, they tear into their picnic basket as well, combining ice cream with hamburgers, pickles, hot dogs, and watermelons in such a way that they all end up with horrible stomachaches (depicted through an animated segment of a hot dog fighting with a scoop of ice cream). The boys are admitted into the hospital for indigestion, just as Darla is released to go home. Darla and her mother promise to visit the boys tomorrow and offer to bring \\"some nice presents\\", forcing Spanky and Alfalfa to wince and moan \\"just bring flowers\\" as they are wheeled away for their treatment: one dose each of castor oil.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Niebylec. Niebylec lies in eastern part of historic Lesser Poland, approximately south-east of Strzyżów and south of the regional capital Rzeszów. The village has a population of 594, and is located along National Road Nr. 9, which also makes Polish part of the European route E371. Niebylec, even though a village now, used to be a town from 1509 until 1919. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the village, known at that time as Jawornik, belonged to the noble Machowski family (Abdank coat of arms). Jawornik received Magdeburg rights in 1509, due to efforts of Mikolaj Machowski of Machow. The town was part of Lesser Poland’s Sandomierz Voivodeship, remaining a small location in the eastern outskirts of the province, close to the border with Red Ruthenia. In 1646, a new Roman Catholic church was built here by Niebylec’s new owner, Janusz Romer. In the late 17th and the 18th centuries, the town belonged to several families. Niebylec was one of the centers of the Bar Confederation, and in 1772 (see Partitions of Poland), it was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, as part of Galicia. In the 19th century, the number of Jews grew in Niebylec, and by the early 20th century, they made the majority of the population. Niebylec lost its charter in 1919, as it was too small to remain a town. During World War II, Jewish population was decimated in the Holocaust. The area of the village was a stronghold of the Home Army (AK), as part of AK’s Rzeszow- South Inspectorate. Niebylec has a parish church, built in 1936–1943 on the spot of the location of the 1646 church. In the village there also is a synagogue (second half of the 19th century), which now houses a library. Furthermore, the village has a 15th-century manor house, rebuilt in the 18th and 19th centuries, and a late 18th-century roadside chapel.

During his tenure, Ramadge reinforced the newspaper's reputation for agenda-setting investigative journalism and strengthened its coverage of Victoria, the nation and, in some measure, the world. He was praised for recruiting and training the next generation of journalists, and for introducing digital innovations. An award-winning iPad app was launched, along with a host of website products. New social media, database and interactive forms of journalism were introduced. The Age was the PANPA Newspaper of the Year at the time of his departure. Other highlights of his editorship included forcing the Victorian Government to launch a parliamentary inquiry into sexual-abuse allegations against the clergy; a years-long investigation into allegations of bank note scams linked to the Reserve Bank of Australia; multi-media coverage – print, television and online – of state and federal election campaigns; and strong advocacy on climate change, asylum-seekers, and the need for progressive, innovative thinking at state and federal levels to reignite infrastructure developments in Australia. The years 2008 to 2012 witnessed a severe tightening of the media market in Australia, and Ramadge was one of many editors forced to reduce staff numbers through voluntary redundancy programs. Ramadge announced on 25 June 2012, that he was stepping down from his role, along with his Sydney Morning Herald counterparts, editor Amanda Wilson and publisher Peter Fray. In July 2012, Ramadge was appointed to the role of Vice- Chancellor’s Professorial Fellow at Monash University, working alongside the then Vice-Chancellor, Professor Ed Byrne. He was commissioned to conduct a campus-wide review of the university’s strategy in Indonesia. This involved an analysis of student and academic flows and projections as well as an appraisal of the opportunities and risks for Monash. The review led to the awarding of an honorary doctorate to the then Indonesian Vice-President, His Excellency Dr Boediono. Ramadge continues as a Vice-Chancellor’s Professorial Fellow. In late 2013, Ramadge, working with a global-engagement team at Monash, developed a concept paper for the establishment of a new Australia-Indonesia Centre. The incoming Australian Government led by Prime Minister Tony Abbott embraced the idea, awarding $15million to Monash University over four years to pursue the centre’s core objectives. Between 2014 and 2016, the centre delivered new-to- market initiatives in bi-national collaborative research, leadership development and education, cultural exchanges, and analyses of attitudes and perceptions. The centre’s board was chaired by Mr Harold Mitchell AC.

The reserve includes Neolithic and Eneolithic findings, a Thracian settlement, Ancient Roman villa and fortress from the 2nd–5th century, medieval Bulgarian palace, pagan sanctuaries, Christian churches and monasteries and fortresses from the First Bulgarian Empire. There is also a cave monastery from the 12th–14th century. Most importantly, Madara is the location of the famous Madara Rider, an early medieval (early 8th-century) large rock relief carved by the Bulgars and also featuring several epigraphs of historic importance written in Medieval Greek; the relief most likely dates to the reign of Tervel of Bulgaria. The large Roman villa may have been at the centre of an imperial estate under the Principate. The villa was damaged in the 3rd century and was partially rebuilt in the 4th. This later phase included at least one horreum built against the north precinct wall and included a wine press and dolia (storage jars), showing that it was used for wine production. The buildings were destroyed and abandoned in the late 4th or early 5th century.Efthymios Rizos: Centres of the late roman military supply network in the Balkans: a survey of horrea, Jahrbuch deS Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmureums Mainz, 60.

Archery has occasionally been used from the backs of other riding animals. In large open areas, it was a highly successful technique for hunting, for protecting the herds, and for war. It was a defining characteristic of the Eurasian nomads during antiquity and the medieval period, as well as the Iranian peoples, (Alans, Scythians, Sarmatians, Parthians, Sassanid Persians) and Indians in antiquity, and by the Hungarians, Mongols, Chinese, and the Turkic peoples during the Middle Ages. By the expansion of these peoples, the practice also spread to Eastern Europe (via the Sarmatians and the Huns), Mesopotamia, and East Asia. In East Asia, horse archery came to be particularly honored in the samurai tradition of Japan, where horse archery is called Yabusame. The term mounted archer occurs in medieval English sources to describe a soldier who rode to battle but who dismounted to shoot. 'Horse archer' is the term used more specifically to describe a warrior who shoots from the saddle at the gallop. Another term, 'horseback archery', has crept into modern use. Horse archery developed separately among the peoples of the South American pampas and the North American prairies; the Comanches were especially skilled.T. R. Fehrenbach. Comanches, the history of a people. Vintage Books. London, 2007. . First published in the USA by Alfred Knopf, 1974. Page 124.

Signed (lower right) Muhammad ibn Mahmudshah al-Khayyam Iran, early 15th century. Ink and gold on paper Since using a bow requires the rider to let go of the reins with both hands, horse archers need superb equestrian skills if they are to shoot on the move. The natives of large grassland areas used horse archery for hunting, for protecting their herds, and for war. Horse archery was for many groups a basic survival skill, and additionally made each able-bodied man, at need, a highly mobile warrior. The buffalo hunts of the North American prairies may be the best-recorded examples of bowhunting by horse archers.Comanche Indians Chasing Buffalo with Lances and Bows. George Catlin 1846-1848. Western Landscape In battle, light horse archers were typically skirmishers, lightly armed missile troops capable of moving swiftly to avoid close combat or to deliver a rapid blow to the flanks or rear of the foe. Captain Robert G. Carter described the experience of facing Quanah Parker's forces: \\"an irregular line of swirling warriors, all rapidly moving in right and left hand circles.. while advancing, to the right or left, and as rapidly concentrating... in the centre... and their falling back in the same manner...all was most puzzling to our... veterans who had never witnessed such tactical maneuvers, or such a flexible line of skirmishers\\"Carter, Captain R. G. On the border with Mackenzie, or Winning West Texas from the Comanches. p 289-290. New York, Antiquarian Press, 1961 (First published 1935). As quoted in Los Comanches. The Horse People, 1751-1845. Stanley Noyes. University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque. 1993 p. 221-222. In the tactic of the Parthian shot the rider would retreat from the enemy while turning his upper body and shooting backward. Due to the superior speed of mounted archers, troops under attack from horse archers were unable to respond to the threat if they did not have ranged weapons of their own. Constant harassment would result in casualties, morale drop and disruption of the formation. Any attempts to charge the archers would also slow the entire army down. An example of these tactics comes from an attack on Comanche horse archers by a group of Texas Rangers, who were saved by their muzzle-loading firearms and by a convenient terrain feature. Fifty Rangers armed with guns met about 20 Comanche hunters who were hunting buffalo and attacked them. The Comanches fled, easily keeping clear of the Rangers, for several miles across the open prairie. They led the Rangers into a stronger force of two hundred. The Rangers immediately retreated, only to discover they had committed a classic error in fighting mounted archers: the Comanches pursued in turn, able to shoot what seemed like clouds of arrows. The Rangers found a ravine where they could shoot at the Comanche from cover. The horse archers did not charge but kept the Rangers under siege until seven of them were dead or dying, whereupon the Rangers retreated but claimed victory.T.R. Fehrenbach. Comanches, the history of a people. Vintage Books. London, 2007. . First published in the USA by Alfred Knopf, 1974. =Heavy horse archers= Horse archers may be either light, such as Scythian, Hun, Parthian, Cuman, or Pecheneg horsemen, or heavy, such as Byzantine kavallarioi, Turkish timariots, Russian druzhina and Japanese samurai. Heavy horse archers typically fought as formed units. Instead of harassing without ever making contact, they shot in volleys, weakening the enemy before they charged. In addition to bows, they often also carried close combat weapons, such as lances or spears. Some nations, like medieval Mongols, Hungarians and Cumans fielded both light and heavy horse archers. In some armies, such as those of the Parthians, Palmyrans, and the Teutonic Order of Knights, the mounted troops consisted of both super-heavy troops (cataphracts and knights) without bows, and light horse archers. Appearance in history Assyrian relief of a mounted archer Parthian horse archer shooting at full gallop, undated relief at the Palazzo Madama, Turin.Horse archery first developed during the Iron Age, gradually replacing the Bronze Age chariot. The earliest depictions of horse archers are found in artwork of the Neo-Assyrian Empire of about the 9th century BC and reflects the incursions of the early Iranian peoples. Early horse archery, depicted on the Assyrian carvings, involved two riders, one controlling both horses while the second shot. Heavy horse archers first appeared in the Assyrian army in the 7th century BC after abandoning chariot warfare and formed a link between light skirmishing cavalrymen and heavy cataphract cavalry. The heavy horse archers usually had mail or lamellar armour and helmets, and sometimes even their horses were armoured. Skirmishing requires vast areas of free space to run, manoeuvre and flee, and if the terrain is close, light horse archers can be charged and defeated easily. Light horse archers are also very vulnerable to foot archers and crossbowmen, who are smaller targets and can outshoot horsemen. Large armies very seldom relied solely on skirmishing horse archers, but there are many examples of victories in which horse archers played a leading part. The Roman general Crassus led a large army, with inadequate cavalry and missile troops, to catastrophe against Parthian horse archers and cataphracts at the Battle of Carrhae. The Persian king Darius the Great led a campaign against the mounted Scythians, who refused to engage in pitched battle; Darius conquered and occupied land but lost enough troops and supplies that he was compelled to withdraw. Darius, however, kept the lands he had conquered. According to the Greek historian Herodotus, the Persian general Mardonius used horse archers to attack and harass his opponents during the Battle of Plataea, which was won by the Greeks. Philip of Macedon scored an epic victory against the Scythians residing north of the Danube, killing their king, Ateas, and causing their kingdom to fall apart thereafter. Alexander the Great defeated Scythians/Sakas in 329 BC at the Battle of Jaxartes, at the Syr Darya river. Later on, Alexander himself used mounted archers recruited among the Scythians and Dahae, during the Greek invasion of India.Ashley. p. 35. The Roman Empire and its military also had an extensive use of horse archers after their conflict with eastern armies that relied heavily on mounted archery in the 1st century BC. They had regiments such as the Equites Sagittarii, who acted as Rome's horse archers in combat.Jeffrey L. Davies: Roman Arrowheads from Dinorben and the 'Sagittarii' of the Roman Army, Britannia, Vol. 8. (1977), pp. 257-270 The Crusaders used conscripted cavalry and horse archers known as the Turcopole, made up of mostly Greek and Turks.R.C. Small: Crusading Warfare 1097-1193, pp. 111-112, Heavy horse archers, instead of skirmishing and hit- and-run tactics, formed in disciplined formations and units, sometimes intermixed with lancers as in Byzantine and Turkish armies, and shot as volleys instead of shooting as individuals. The usual tactic was to first shoot five or six volleys at the enemy to weaken him and to disorganise them, and then charge. Heavy horse archers often carried spears or lances for close combat, or formed mixed units with lancers. The Mongol armies and others included both heavy and light horse archers. Heavy horse archers could usually outshoot their light counterparts, and because of the armour they wore, could better withstand return fire. The Russian druzhina cavalry developed as a countermeasure to the Tatar light troops. Likewise, the Turkish timariots and qapikulu were often as heavily armoured as Western knights, and could match the Hungarian, Albanian and Mongol horse archers.16th-century Muscovite cavalry. Vietnam's mounted archers were first recorded in the 11th century. In 1017, Emperor Lý Công Uẩn of Đại Việt opened the Xa dinh (archery school) in southern Hanoi and ordered all children of noblemen and mandarins to be trained in mounted archery. During the reign of Lý Thánh Tông, the royal guards had 20 horse archer teams, combined into 5 companies named Kỵ Xạ, Du Nỗ, Tráng Nỗ, Kính Nỗ, and Thần Tý, comprising about 2,000 skillful horse archers. They later effectively participated in the Invasion of Song China (1075 – 1076) and caused heavy casualties to the Song army.Nguyễn Thị Dơn, 2001 \\"Collection of Lê dynasty weapons in Ngọc khánh\\" p. 63. The Ly Dynasty's horse archers also fought against Champa (1069) and the Khmer Empire (1125–1130) which both were victories for Đại Việt. Later, following the decline of the Lý dynasty, most horse archer teams were disbanded.Phan Huy Chú, Lịch triều hiến chương loại chí, p. 320. German and Scandinavian medieval armies made extensive use of mounted crossbowmen. They would act not only as scouts and skirmishers, but also protect the flanks of the knights and infantry, chasing away enemy light cavalry. When the battle was fully engaged, they would charge at the enemy flank, shoot a single devastating volley at point-blank range and then attack the enemy with swords, without reloading. In some instances, mounted crossbowmen could also reload and fire continuously on horseback if they used specific \\"weaker\\" crossbows that could be reloaded easily, as mentioned in the 13th-century Norwegian educational text Konungs skuggsjá.Heath, Ian. Armies of Feudal Europe 1066-1300. Wargames Research Group; 2nd Revised edition (Sept. 1989). p. 165. The invention of spanning mechanisms such as the goat's foot lever and the cranequin allowed mounted crossbowmen to reload and fire heavy crossbows on horseback.Payne-Gallwey, Ralph. The Crossbow: Its Military and Sporting History, Construction and Use. Skyhorse Publishing; First edition (April 1, 2007). Dezobry and Bachelet, Dictionary of Biography, t.1, Ch.Delagrave, 1876, p. 704 =Decline= Horse archery was usually ineffective against massed foot archery. The foot archers or crossbowmen could outshoot horse archers and a man alone is a smaller target than a man and a horse. The Crusaders countered the Turkoman horse archery with their crossbowmen, and Genoese crossbowmen were favoured mercenaries in both Mamluk and Mongol armies. Likewise the Chinese armies consisted of massed crossbowmen to counter the nomad armies. A nomad army that wanted to engage in an archery exchange with foot archers would itself normally dismount. The typical Mongol archer shot from a sitting position when dismounted. Another example of combined troops winning against armies mostly of horse archers is the highly successful Han campaign against the mounted Xiongnu nomads. Well-led Roman troops managed to score crushing defeats against the Parthians, including the Roman–Parthian War of 161–66 and Trajan's war against Parthia, and succeeded in sacking the Parthian capital on three occasions. Horse archers were eventually rendered obsolete by the maturity of firearm technology. In the 16th and subsequent centuries, various cavalry forces armed with firearms gradually started appearing. Because the conventional arquebus and musket were too awkward for a cavalryman to use, lighter weapons such as the carbine had to be developed, which could be effectively used from horseback, much in the same manner as the composite recurve bow presumably developed from earlier bows. 16th-century dragoons and carabiniers were heavier cavalry equipped only with firearms, but pistols coexisted with the composite bow, often used by the same rider, well into the 17th century in Eastern Europe, especially with the Muscovites, Kalmyks, Turks and Cossacks. For many armies, mounted archery remained an effective tactical system in open country until the introduction of repeating firearms. Qing Dynasty mounted archers face off against Dzungar mounted musketeers. By the 18th century, firearms had largely displaced traditional composite bows in Mongolia, whereas in Manchuria horse archery was still highly esteemed. In the 1758 Battle of Khorgos, mounted Mongolian Dzungars troops armed with muskets faced off against Qing Dynasty mounted Manchurian, Mongolian, and Chinese archers armed with Manchu bows. The battle was won by the Qing forces, and traditional Manchurian archery continued to be practiced in China up to the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty in 1911. During the Napoleonic Wars, the Russian Imperial Army deployed Cossack, Bashkir, and Kalmyk horse archers against Napoleon's forces. Baron de Marbot writes that on the eve of the Battle of Leipzig, his forces encountered mounted archers: Bashkirs and Cossacks fighting French Forces at the Battle of Leipzig (1813). Although general de Marbot describes the horse archers in disdainful terms, the general was himself wounded in the leg by an enemy arrow, and Baskir troops were amongst the occupying troops in Paris in 1814. Bashkir Horse Archers in Paris 1814. It has been proposed that firearms began to replace bows in Europe and Russia not because firearms were superior but because they were easier to use and required less practice.Donald Ostrowski, \\"The Replacement of the Composite Reflex Bow by Firearms in the Muscovite Cavalry,\\" Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History 11, no. 3 (2010): 513-534 However, discussing buffalo hunting in 1846, Francis Parkman noted that \\"the bows and arrows which the Indians use in running buffalo have many advantages over firearms, and even white men occasionally employ them.\\"The Oregon Trail (1847) by Francis Parkman. Chapter 24. https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail/Chapter_24 The Comanches of North America found their bows more effective than muzzle loading guns. \\"After... about 1800, most Comanches began to discard muskets and pistols and to rely on their older weapons.\\"T.R. Fehrenbach. Comanches, the history of a people. Vintage Books. London, 2007. . First published in the USA by Alfred Knopf, 1974. Page 125. Bows were still used by Native Americans in the late American Indian Wars, but almost all warriors who had immediate access to modern repeating firearms used these guns instead. Technology The weapon of choice for Eurasian horse archers was most commonly a composite recurve bow, because it was compact enough to shoot conveniently from a horse while retaining sufficient range and penetrating power. North Americans used short wooden bows often backed with sinew, but never developed the full three-layer composite bow.  Modern revival  Horse archery and associated skills were revived in Mongolia after independence in 1921 and are displayed at festivals, in particular the Naadam.http://www.atarn.org/mongolian/mn_nat_arch/mn_nat_arch.htm Mongolian National Archery by Munkhtsetseg. Despite the formidable history of Mongolian horse archers, the sport is very limited in Mongolia itself today and at most Naadam festivals the archery and horse-riding competitions are conducted independently; the horses are raced with one another, and the archery is traditionally practiced from a standing position rather than mounted. In the past five years a desire to revive the tradition seems to have been addressed with the foundation of the Mongolian Horseback Archery Association whose members have competed in South Korea and Europe.

At the Guozijian, law, mathematics, calligraphy, equestrianism, and archery were emphasized by the Ming dynasty Hongwu Emperor in addition to Confucian classics and also required in the Imperial Examinations.http://www.san.beck.org/3-7-MingEmpire.html Archery and equestrianism were added to the exam by Hongwu in 1370 like how archery and equestrianism were required for non-military officials at the 武舉 College of War in 1162 by the Song Emperor Xiaozong. The area around the Meridian Gate of Nanjing was used for archery by guards and generals under Hongwu.http://en.dpm.org.cn/EXPLORE/ming-qing/ The Imperial exam included archery. Archery on horseback was practiced by Chinese living near the frontier. Wang Ju's writings on archery were followed during the Ming and Yuan and the Ming developed new methods of archery. Jinling Tuyong showed archery in Nanjing during the Ming. Contests in archery were held in the capital for Garrison of Guard soldiers who were handpicked. Equestrianism and archery were favored activities of Zhu Di (the Yongle Emperor). Archery and equestrianism were frequent pastimes by the Zhengde Emperor. He practiced archery and horseriding with eunuchs. Tibetan Buddhist monks, Muslim women and musicians were obtained and provided to Zhengde by his guard Ch'ien Ning, who acquainted him with the ambidextrous archer and military officer Chiang Pin. An accomplished military commander and archer was demoted to commoner status on a wrongful charge of treason was the Prince of Lu's grandson in 1514. He was disinterested in military matters but had prowess in archery (Hongxi Emperor). Archery competitions, equestrianism and calligraphy were some of the pastimes of the Wanli Emperor. Football and archery were practiced by the Ming Emperors.https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/aug/24/ming-british- museum-empire-strikes-back-50-years-changed-china Traditional Korean  Korea has a tradition of horse archery. In 2007, the Korean government passed a law to preserve and encourage development of traditional Korean martial arts, including horse archery. In Korean archery competitions there are five disciplines that are competed separately. The major difference in Korean archery is that all arrows must be stowed somewhere on the archer or horse, unlike Hungarian style where the archer can take the arrows from the bow hand. Traditionally this is a quiver on the right thigh, but it may also be through a belt, a sash, a saddle quiver or even held in a boot or arm quiver. The first competition is a single shot to the side. The track is long (as in the Hungarian method) but carries only one target set back around 5–10m from the track. This has a unique fascia that consists of five square concentric rings which increase in point score from the outer to inner; the inner (often decorated with a 'Tiger' face) is worth the maximum five points. Each archer has two passes to complete, and each run has to be completed within 16 seconds (or penalty points are incurred). The next competition is very similar but is known as the double shot which features one target in the first 30m, slightly angled forwards, and a second target in the last 30m, slightly angled backwards. The final competition for the static targets is the serial shot which consists of five targets evenly spaced along a track, approximately one target every or so. In all three static target competitions, additional bonus points are awarded for style and form.For a pictorial presentation, see: Korean track Another major difference in Korean archery style is the Mogu, or moving target competition. This consists of one rider towing a large cotton- and-bamboo ball behind their horse while another archer attempts to shoot the ball (with special turnip-headed arrows which have been dipped in ink). The archer attempts to hit the ball as many times as possible. A second Mo Gu event consists of a team of two trying to hit the target towed by a third rider. Points are awarded for how many arrows strike the ball (verified by the ink stains on the Mogu). Traditional Japanese  Yabusame archer on horseback The history of Japanese horse archery dates back to the 4th century.Nihon Shoki volume 14 \\"大泊瀬天皇 彎弓驟馬(horse archery) 而陽呼 曰猪有 即射殺市邊押磐皇子 皇子帳内佐伯部賣輪\\" It became popular in Japan, attracting crowds. The emperor found that the crowds were not appropriate to the solemn and sacred nature of the occasion, and banned public displays in 698.Shoku Nihongi volume 1 \\"禁山背國賀茂祭日會衆騎射(horseback archery)\\" Horse archery was a widely used combat technique from the Heian Period to the Warring States Period.Turnbull S. The samurai, a military history. Page 19 \\"At this time [about 1000 CE] the bow was the most important weapon and the mark of the samurai ... The samurai was essentially a mounted archer.\\" Nasu no Yoichi, a samurai of the Kamakura Period is the most famous horse archer in Japan. Three kinds of Japanese horse archery (Kasagake, Yabusame, and Inuoumono (dog shooting)) were defined. When the arquebus was introduced by the Portuguese to Japan in the 16th century, archery became outdated. To maintain traditional Japanese horse archery, Tokugawa Yoshimune, the shōgun, ordered the Ogasawara clan to found a school. Current Japanese horse archery succeeds to the technique reformed by the Ogasawara clan. Traditionally, women were barred from performing in yabusame, but in 1963 female archers participated in a yabusame demonstration for the first time.\\"Kishagasa\\", by Alice Gordenker. Japan Times Tuesday, May 16, 2006. http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ek20060516wh.html The Yabusame school of horseback archery has found a following in Australia, with the setting up of the Australian Horse Archery School which today conducts public shows in various parts of the world.  United States  Horse archery is a growing sport in the United States, as well. Through the efforts of The Mounted Archery Association of the Americas, there are horse archery clubs around the country. Competitive courses one might find in the U.S. incorporate the Korean, Hungarian and Persian Styles (i.e., the Qabaq). Participants combine the skills of an archer with the skills of a good rider to create this beautiful equestrian sport. Emphasis on care and training of the horse is evident as riders run reinless down a 90-meter course while loosing arrows at various target arrangements. Surprisingly, as challenging as the sport appears to be, many who have never picked up a bow can achieve great success with some courage and a little practice. MA3 Clubs around the country offer members the opportunity to learn the sport by providing ranges, a ranking system, and competitions.  United Kingdom  The British Horseback Archery Association was established in 2007, and is the governing body of horse archery. The first national competition took place in 2010. Since 2013, members have represented Great Britain in international team competitions. Postal matches are also held with participants from across the UK. Categories for disabled riders and for juniors have also been introduced.  Hungary  Kassai Lajos created the competitive rule system of horse archery in the late 1980s, and started to propagate this new sport, first in Hungary, and from the 1990s in the rest of Europe, the United States and Canada. His life and work was dramatized by Géza Kaszás in the film A lovasíjász (The horse archer), which premiered in January 2016.

At Brandeis, Marder is also a member of the Volen National Center for Complex Systems. Dr. Marder is known for her pioneering work on small neuronal networks which her team has interrogated via a combination of complementary experimental and theoretical techniques. Marder is particularly well known in the community for her work on neural circuits in the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system (STNS), a small network of 30 neurons. She discovered that circuits are not “hard-wired” to produce a single output or behavior, but can be reconfigured by neuromodulators to produce many outputs and behaviors while still maintaining the integrity of the circuit. Her work has revolutionized the way scientists approach the studies of neural circuits with respect to the study of structural and functional behavior. The general principles that have resulted from her work are thought to be generally applicable to other neural networks, including those in humans. Marder has received numerous awards for her pioneering work in the field including memberships in the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2013, she was named to the National Institute of Health working group for the BRAIN Initiative. Career, research, and service Marder was born in Manhattan and raised on the east coast. Although she loved biology from an early age, Marder has shared that she held very diverse academic interests prior to starting her undergraduate degree and in fact entered Brandeis University as an undergraduate in 1965 with a plan to study politics and become a lawyer. She would instead find herself re-captivated by the world of biology and switched majors to Biology after her freshman year. Marder has shared that a pivotal turning point in her scientific self-development was writing a paper on schizophrenia during an abnormal psychology class during her junior year. Her subsequent library studies on inhibition in neural signaling solidified her career goals to become a neuroscientist and launched her on what would become her lifelong academic path. Marder received her B.A. from Brandeis University in 1969 and subsequently completed Ph.D. studies at University of California, San Diego. It was during her time as a graduate student at UCSD that Marder would be introduced to the specific neural network, the lobster stomatogastric-ganglion system, that would prove pivotal for the rest of her academic career. Marder's doctoral work on the role of acetylcholine in the lobster STG led to a single-author paper in Nature. She completed her postdoctoral training at the University of Oregon in Eugene and the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, France. Marder subsequently began her independent research career at Brandeis University in 1978 as a faculty member in the department in Biology. Her work on the 30 neurons that compose the lobster stomatogastric ganglion (STG) produced many notable findings. She found that circuits can be modulated by many neuromodulators, which act on the level of populations of neurons, unlike some neurotransmitters, which can only affect specific target neurons. She pioneered work on plasticity and homeostasis, revealing more about how the brain can change dramatically during learning and development yet remain structurally stable. Her recent work examining network variability among healthy individuals shows that a variety of network parameters can produce the same behavioral outcome, challenging a long- standing goal in theoretical neuroscience to model 'ideal' neurons and neural circuits. Along with Larry Abbott, she also developed the dynamic clamp method, which enables an experimenter to induce mathematically modeled conductances into living neurons to view the output of theoretical circuits. She is currently an elected counselor for the National Academy of Science, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the United States National Academy of Sciences, serves on the National Institutes of Health working group for the BRAIN Initiative, and is a former president of the Society for Neuroscience. She is also a Deputy Editor at eLife, and, due to her early interest in politics, she often writes about science, politics, and society. In 1990 at Brandeis, she established one of the first undergraduate neuroscience programs in the United States.

During World War I he was the head of the Dutch Royal Opera (1916–18) and held summer concerts of the Orchestra in Residence of the Hague in Scheveningen (1914–19). Although his recordings are few, on 14, 17, and 18 October 1924 with the Pasdeloup Orchestra he committed to disc the first ever recording of Hector Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique. Serge Sandberg entrusted him with the direction of the Pasdeloup concert (the French \\"Proms\\"), the mission of which was to democratise access to music, providing commentary and analysis prior to the performance of works. He organized this event until 1932 and continued to lead the orchestra until the end of his life. He died at Le Mans. =Premieres= He created the first performances of a number of notable musical works: *Les Evocations by Albert Roussel (1912) *Printemps by Claude Debussy (1913) *Habanera by Louis Aubert (1919) *Alborada del gracioso (1919) and Le tombeau de Couperin by Maurice Ravel *Les Agrestides and the Organ Symphony by Georges Migot (1922) *Requiem by Guy Ropartz (1939) Arthur Honegger dedicated Le Chant de Nigamon (1918) to Rhené-Baton, as did Albert Roussel with his 2nd symphony (1923). Compositions Rhené-Baton composed pieces for orchestra, chamber ensembles and a large number of piano works. His 6 Songs for Marycinthe were created at the request of Maurice Duhamel. Breton subjects appear frequently in his works, such as \\"Au pardon de Rumengol\\", \\"En Bretagne\\", \\"Vieille chapelle en Cornouaille\\". He also set to music the poems of Auguste Brizeux (Le Clocher) and Louis Tiercelin (Chansons bretonnes). Some of his works were influenced by the vogue for orientalism at the time.Rhené-Baton sur compositeursbretons.com A founding member of the Association des Compositeurs Bretons in 1912, he composed many works using a Breton folk idiom. In July 2019 Brilliant Classics released a double CD album dedicated to Rhené-Baton's chamber music for strings and piano, performed by the Wolferl Trio, which includes three premier recordings of the Violin Sonatas No. 1 and 2, the Suite ancienne, the Cello Sonata and the Piano Trio. =Works= Symphonic and OperaticVariations, for piano and orchestra on a theme in the aeolian mode (1904) *Menuet pour Monsieur, frère du roi (1909) *Poème élégiaque, for violon et orchestre (1924) *Danses paysannes (1924) *En vacances (1924) *Pour les funérailles d'un marin (1925) *Fantaisie orientale, for violin and orchestra (1926) *Petite suite, for brass band (1932) *several film scores, 1928–29 Chamber musicViolin Sonata No. 1 (1921) *Cello Sonata (1923) *Piano Trio (1924) *Poème élégiaque, for cello and piano (1924) *Passacaille, Op. 35, for flute and piano (1924) *Bourrée, Op. 42, for flute and piano (1926) *Fantaisie orientale, for violin and piano (1926) *Violin Sonata No. 2 (1927) *Suite ancienne, for violin and piano (1933) PianoÉtude en La mineur (1901) *Prélude en Ré mineur (1901) *Sérénade fantastique (1901) *Six Préludes (1901) *Pour Yvonne Billot (1902) *Album Rose (1902) *En Bretagne, Op. 13 (suite de six pièces) (1909) *Ballade en la bémol, Op. 22 (1921) *Dans le style rococo, Op. 23 (1921) *Au pardon de Rumengol, Op. 25 (1922) *Danses à sept temps, Op. 30 (1923) *Dans la Clairière, Op. 36 (1925) *Cortège funèbre d'un Samouraï, Op. 37 (1925) *Marche des Rois Mages, Op. 39 (1925) *Danse de la Saint-Jean, Op. 40 (1926) *Vieille chapelle en Cornouaille, Op. 41 (1926) *2me Ballade, Op. 43 (1926) *Danse pour Anne de Bretagne, Op. 44 (1926) *Valse romantique, Op. 45 (1927) *River-side, Op. 49 (1928) *Pour la jeunesse, Op. 51 (1929) *Potiron, Op. 58 (1938) Vocal and religiouspieces for voice and piano *Chansons pour Marycinthe, for orchestra (1931) References External links René, Emmanuel Bâton * Rhené-Baton sur compositeursbretons.com  Recording of the Cello Sonata by Rhené-Baton * Complete Chamber music: 1879 births 1940 deaths 20th-century classical composers 20th-century French composers 20th-century French conductors (music) 20th- century French male musicians Breton musicians Conservatoire de Paris alumni French classical composers French male classical composers French male conductors (music) People from Courseulles-sur-Mer ","title":"Rhené-Baton"},{"id":"19685458","title":"Senecavirus"},{"id":"19685464","text":"Alistair Darling, Chancellor of the Exchequer in 2008. A bank rescue package totalling some £500 billion (approximately $850 billion) was announced by the British government on 8 October 2008, as a response to the global financial crisis. After two unsteady weeks at the end of September, the first week of October had seen major falls in the stock market and severe worries about the stability of British banks. The plan aimed to restore market confidence and help stabilise the British banking system, and provided for a range of what was claimed to be short-term \\"loans\\" from the taxpayer and guarantees of interbank lending, including up to £50 billion of taxpayer investment in the banks themselves. The government also bought shares in some banks, which have since been sold back to the market at an overall profit to the taxpayer. Subsequently, broadly similar measures were introduced by the United States and the European Union in response to the financial crisis. Some commentators noted that, although under the capitalist model inefficient private commercial enterprises should be allowed to go bust, the banks were \\"too big to fail\\".  Background  The announcement came less than 48 hours after Britain's leading share index, the FTSE100, recorded its largest single-day points fall since 1987.  The rescue plan  The plan provided for several sources of funding to be made available, to an aggregate total of £500 billion in loans and guarantees. Most simply, £200 billion was made available for short term loans through the Bank of England's Special Liquidity Scheme. Secondly, the Government supported British banks in their plan to increase their market capitalisation through the newly formed Bank Recapitalisation Fund, by £25 billion in the first instance with a further £25 billion to be called upon if needed. Thirdly, the Government temporarily underwrote any eligible lending between British banks, giving a loan guarantee of around £250 billion. However, only £400 billion of this was 'fresh money', as there was already in place a system for short term loans to the value of £100 billion. Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, told the House of Commons in a statement on 8 October 2008 that the proposals were \\"designed to restore confidence in the banking system\\", and that the funding would \\"put the banks on a stronger footing\\". Prime Minister Gordon Brown suggested that the government's actions had 'led the way' for other nations to follow whilst Shadow Chancellor George Osborne stated that \\"This is the final chapter of the age of irresponsibility and it’s absolutely extraordinary that a government has been driven by events to today's announcement\\"; in addition to offering opposition support for the plan. Also on the 8 October 2008 there was a strategic and co-ordinated global effort by seven central banks to calm the financial crisis, by cutting interest rates by 0.5%. The banks were all members of the OECD and included The Bank of England, The European Central Bank and the U.S Federal reserve along with central banks in China, Switzerland, Canada and Sweden. =Comparison with U.S. TARP= The British rescue plan differed from the initial United States' $700bn bailout under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which was announced on 3 October and entitled the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The £50bn being invested by the UK Government saw them purchasing shares in the banks, whereas the American program was primarily devoted to the U.S. government purchasing the mortgage backed securities of the American banks which were not able to be sold in the secondary mortgage securities market. The U.S. program required the U.S. government to take an equity interest in financial organisations selling their securities into the TARP but did not address the fundamental solvency problem faced by the banking sector; rather was aimed at tackling the immediate funding shortfall. The UK package tackled both solvency, through the £50bn recapitalisation plan, and funding, through the government guarantee for banks' debt issuances and the expansion of the Bank of England's Special Liquidity Scheme. Announced on 14 October, the U.S. subsequently undertook investments in banks through the Capital Purchase Program and the FDIC guaranteed banks' debt through the Temporary Lending Guarantee Program. =Capital investment= Through the Bank Recapitalisation Fund, the government bought a combination of ordinary shares and preference shares in affected banks. The amount and proportion of the stake taken in any one bank was negotiated with the individual bank. Banks that took the rescue packages had restrictions on executive pay and dividends to existing shareholders, as well as a mandate to offer reasonable credit to homeowners and small businesses. The long-term government plan was to offset the cost of this program by receiving dividends from these shares, and in the long run, to sell the shares after a market recovery. This plan covered the possibility of underwriting new issues of shares by any participating bank. The plan has been characterised as, in effect, partial nationalisation. The extent to which different banks participated varied according to their needs. HSBC Group issued a statement announcing it was injecting £750 m of capital into the UK bank and therefore has \\"no plans to utilise the UK government's recapitalisation initiative ... [as] the Group remains one of the most strongly capitalised and liquid banks in the world\\".Capital base of HSBC UK strengthened , 9 October 2008 Standard Chartered also declared its support for the scheme but its intention not to participate in the capital injection element.Standard Chartered welcomes UK Government announcement 8 October 2008 Barclays raised its own new capital from private investors. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group raised £20 billion from the Bank Recapitalisation Fund, with £5 billion in preference shares and a further £15 billion being issued as ordinary shares. HBOS and Lloyds TSB together raised £17 billion, £8.5 billion in preference shares and a further £8.5 billion issue of ordinary shares. The Fund purchased the preference shares outright, for a total £13.5 billion investment, and underwrote the issues of ordinary shares. Participating banks The plan was open to all UK incorporated banks and all building societies, including the following: Abbey, Barclays, Clydesdale Bank, HBOS, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, Nationwide Building Society, Royal Bank of Scotland, Standard Chartered Bank. However, of these, Abbey, Barclays, Clydesdale, HSBC, Nationwide, and Standard Chartered chose not to receive any government money, leaving Lloyds and RBS as the only major recipients. Darling said in 2018 that the country was hours away from a breakdown of law and order if the Royal Bank of Scotland had not been bailed out and people could not access money. Reactions Paul Krugman, writing in his column for The New York Times, stated that \\"Mr Brown and Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer have defined the character of the worldwide rescue effort, with other wealthy nations playing catch-up.\\" He also stated that \\"Luckily for the world economy,... Gordon Brown and his officials are making sense,... And they may have shown us the way through this crisis.\\" Other commentators noted that although the capitalist model should have allowed inefficient businesses to go bust, the banks were \\"too big to fail\\".https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/09/have-the-too-big-to- fail-banks-really-met-their-waterloo The British banking bail-out example was closely followed by the rest of Europe, as well as the U.S Government, who on the 14 October 2008 announced a $250bn (£143bn) Capital Purchase Program to buy stakes in a wide variety of banks in an effort to restore confidence in the sector. The money came from the $700bn bail-out package approved by U.S. lawmakers earlier that month. A wave of international action to address the financial crisis had at last an effect on stock markets around the world. Although shares in the affected banks fell, the Dow Jones went up by more than 900 points, or 11.1 per cent, while London shares also bounced back, with the FTSE100 Index closing more than 8 per cent higher on the 13 October 2008. The shares in RBS and Lloyds have now started to be sold off. Labour criticised the Conservative government for making a huge loss for taxpayers on the sale of the RBS shares. The government claimed that this will be more than made up for by a profit on the Lloyds shares and that waiting for longer to sell the RBS shares would not necessarily lead to a higher price for them. The loss to the tax payer of the first round of RBS share sell off is stated by the BBC to be £1.07bn compared to when they were sold.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33769906 Other estimates were that the loss to taxpayers,Equity Ownership Statistics, accessed 9 June 2018 and a consequent subsidy to private shareholders in the bank, was £2 billion.

The house was built in 1816 by William Wyndham to the designs of Sir Jeffry Wyatville, replacing a 17th-century house. In 1916 the estate was bought by Bertram Philipps, who renamed the house after himself, then in 1943 gave the house and grounds to the National Trust. The house and its parkland (known as Dinton Park) are Grade II* listed. The house is built of Chilmark stone, a local stone also used for Salisbury Cathedral, and Wyatt is believed to have based his design on Pythouse, some seven miles (11 km) away at Newtown, near Tisbury. The house is two-storied with symmetrically set chimney stacks and a central lantern. The main (south) front has nine bays with an Ionic portico. The rooms are planned around a spacious square hall with an imperial staircase to the first floor. The house is one of the first in England to have a central heating system installed, which was achieved by pumping hot air from a boiler in the basement into the stairwell. History The house was designed by Jeffry Wyatt, later Sir Jeffry Wyatville for William Wyndham (1769–1841), a descendant of Sir Wadham Wyndam, and was built between 1814 and 1817 on the site of an earlier, demolished seventeenth-century house, Dinton House, which had been the Wyndham family home since 1689. It was sold in 1916 by William Wyndham (1868–1951) of Orchard Wyndham in Somerset, whose father William VI Wyndham (1834–1914), of Dinton House, had inherited Orchard Wyndham as heir male to his grandfather William IV Wyndham (1769–1841), of Dinton, under the will of his distant cousin George Francis Wyndham, 4th Earl of Egremont (1786–1845) (who shared common descent from Sir John Wyndham (1558–1645) of Orchard Wyndham).Burke's Landed Gentry, 1937, p.2511, pedigree of Wyndham In 1917 foreclosure proceedings were brought against Dinton House and its estate.

His brothers were John Philipps, 1st Viscount St Davids; Owen Philipps, 1st Baron Kylsant; Major-General Sir Ivor Philipps; and Laurence Philipps, 1st Baron Milford; several of them were Members of Parliament and directors or stockholders in the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company and other shipping companies. who renamed the house after himself.

Philipps and his wife, who had no children, annually hosted the pupils from the village school for a tea party at Philipps House with sports and fireworks. In 1936, Philipps leased the house to the YWCA and moved to nearby Hyde's House, a former rectory which he had bought in 1924 and where he lived until his death.\\"Dinton – Andrews Newspaper Index Cards, 1790–1976,\\" Wiltshire OPC, 2011, accessed 22 June 2013\\"Dinton Recreation Ground,\\" South Wilshire Strategic Alliance, accessed 22 June 2013Philipps died intestate on 10 February 1947 at Menton, France, where he was staying with his wife, Florence, who died a week earlier on February 4. Philipps's brother Laurence, Baron Milford, was subsequently appointed his personal representative for the probate of his estate. During World War II, the park in front of Philipps House was requisitioned for use by the United States Army Air Force, who erected a number of Nissen huts there. In 1943 Philipps gave the house and of parkland to the National Trust, along with Hyde's House as well as a number of paintings owned by the Wyndham and Philipps families.  National Trust  Although the house and estate became the property of the National Trust, the property was handed over on the condition that it would continue to be leased to the YWCA, on a peppercorn rent, for as long as they had purposeful use for it. During their occupation the house was predominantly used as an artists' retreat, providing residential art courses for keen amateur and semi-professional painters. Philipps House was much loved by many creative people during this era. The interior spaces were converted into artist studios with bedrooms available for paying guests. The grounds and outlying area also provided locations for landscape painting. Some of Britain's best contemporary artists such as Tom Coates, Edward Wesson, Ken Paine, Deborah Manifold, and John Yardley provided tuition, amongst others. The YWCA remained at Philipps House until 1995. Despite the art courses being as heavily subscribed to as ever, the withdrawal of the YWCA was inevitable after the terms of the lease were changed when it was presented to the YWCA for renewal, a process that occurred every ten years. The lease transferred the cost of maintaining the structure of the house and other amenities from the National Trust to the YWCA at a time when many major works were due, such as laying new pipes from the neighbouring village of Dinton. After the YWCA left, the National Trust carried out a thorough refurbishment of the house, which was leased to a tenant family. The house is, as of June 2016, closed to the public.

He was born in Leicester and opened a music shop in the city in 1906. A short time later his first song, \\"Down By The Stream\\", was published, and by 1912 he had established the Lawrence Wright Music Co in Denmark Street, London. Wright went on to write (or co-write) over 600 songs under his own name and as Horatio Nicholls, including the World War I propaganda song \\"Are We Downhearted? No!\\", and would receive an Ivor Novello Award in 1962 for Outstanding Contribution to British Popular Music. He was one of the very rare composers of popular music in this period to make a substantial amount of money - it had not been unusual to see composers who had written dozens of hits die in poverty. In 1927, Wright appeared in a short film made in the DeForest Phonofilm with excerpts of his revue Sensations of 1927. His 1927 collaboration with Edgar Leslie, \\"Among My Souvenirs\\", has been covered by artists including Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, Judy Garland, and Connie Francis. Wright founded Melody Maker magazine in 1926. He moved to Blackpool in the early 1920s and became a show promoter. Running \\"On With The Show\\" on the North Pier for a record-breaking 32 years (1924 - 1956). He lived in a mock castle house, later called the Castle Casino, on Blackpool's North Promenade. After he began using a wheelchair, he moved to a bungalow in Carlin Gate. After being sold, much memorabilia was discovered at the address including posters, bills, letters, sheet music and musical scores.

With league football suspended due to World War I until the following year, he had to wait until 18 October 1919 to make his debut, in a 0–1 defeat to Bury. He battled for his spot in defence with Jackery Jones over his first seasons, but played every round of the club's route to the 1921 FA Cup Final. However, Baugh was injured in the weeks leading up to the game and missed their defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. With Jones having retired at the end of the season, Baugh made the spot his own and was a near ever-present over the next season and-a-half until suffering injury. Baugh remained on the club's books until June 1924 when he moved to their rivals West Bromwich Albion after making 120 appearances in total for Wolves.

Dimitar Solunski\\") is a medieval Bulgarian Orthodox church in the city of Veliko Tarnovo in central northern Bulgaria, the former capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire.  Location  The church lies at the northeastern foot of the Trapezitsa and Tsarevets hills, on the right bank of the Yantra River, outside the city's medieval fortifications. Architecturally, it has a pentahedral apse and a cross-domed design with a narthex and a fore-apse space. It was once part of a large monastery and belonged in its southeastern part. The church's exterior is decorated with blind arches and colourful ornaments: glazed rosettes, suns, rhombs and other painted figures. The church was built of stone alternated with three rows of bricks. It is in size. According to the account of Niketas Choniates, the church was the place where the anti-Byzantine Uprising of Asen and Peter was proclaimed in 1185; it was this uprising that led to the reestablishment of the Bulgarian Empire and the proclamation of Tarnovo for its capital. It is theorized that it was a royal church in the early years of the empire and it received donations from members of the Asen dynasty. According to the legend, the nobles (bolyari) Asen and Peter announced that the patron of Thessaloniki, the warrior saint Demetrius, would desert his city and come to Tarnovo to aid the Bulgarian rebels. The brothers built and inaugurated a church in his honour. The Church of St Demetrius was destroyed in the second half of the 13th century, probably due to an earthquake, but was reconstructed in the 1350s. A single-apse church was built nearby in the 1360s and existed until the 17th century; it used materials from the destroyed Church of St Demetrius. The monastery yard and the destroyed buildings became a predominantly Christian necropolis during the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria. During the Bulgarian National Revival, the church was associated with the leatherworkers' guild. In the late 18th and early 19th century, the Church of St Demetrius was plundered by robbers. In the second half of the 19th century it was in a very bad condition, which was noted by Bulgarian and foreign researchers, including Felix Philipp Kanitz. An earthquake in 1913 destroyed it completely, leaving only the apse and fragments of the original frescoes. The Church of St Demetrius of Thessaloniki was reconstructed beginning in 1977–1985 based on the available architectural remains and the example of better preserved Bulgarian churches from the same period. The project was headed by Teofil Teofilov. Of the original church, two layers of frescoes have been preserved: an early one dating either to the church's construction or to the second half of the 14th century and a later one painted after the 14th century.

It was once home to the club, one of the city's most prestigious gentlemen's organizations. In 1982 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The club was established in the late 19th century, but the building was not erected until the early 20th. It is one of only two brick Colonial Revival buildings in the city, and a sophisticated application of that style. Efforts to redevelop it in the early 21st century led to a protracted legal threats and negotiated settlement between the city and the local software company which currently utilize the building as its corporate headquarters and development laboratory. Building The Amrita Club is in a very historic neighborhood. It is across the street from the Market Street Row, a group of houses that includes Poughkeepsie's oldest frame house, and immediately north of the Hasbrouck House, with the Adriance Memorial Library a few houses down. It is across Church from the armory and across on the opposite corner is the Old Poughkeepsie YMCA. All of these are also listed on the Register. alt=An arched stone entrance on a brick background, with smooth columns on either side and metal-framed glass double doors topped by a round- arched transom with keystone and a stone pediment The building itself is a rectangular structure three stories tall, with raised basement, and eight to nine bays wide by three deep. Its double-doored, centrally-located entrance has a marble surround consisting of columns with sculpted capitals and a dentilled entablature. Below that, the doors themselves are topped with a stained glass transom. The whole doorway is further topped with a keystone decorated with fleur-de-lis and ribbons on either side. On either flank of the entrance, the first floor features French windows and iron balconies, except for the smaller windows next to the door, trimmed with marble lintels and sills. A similar pattern is found on the larger windows of the third story. Above them is a dentilled cornice and architrave; two large chimneys rise from the hipped roof. The rear elevation features two porches with Doric columns. History The club was founded in 1873 for local businessmen and professionals, with future neighbor and prominent local lawyer Frank Hasbrouck as one of the charter members. It excluded Catholics, African-Americans and Jews, and soon became synonymous with the city's elite. In 1905, local historian Edmund Platt described as \\"the first club of any importance\\". \\"Much of Poughkeepsie's growth was decided at the Amrita Club's dinner table\\", writes Carolyn Burke in her biography of Lee Miller, whose father was a member during her childhood. It met either in rented rooms or refurbished older buildings until it decided to build its own clubhouse in 1912. Designed by Alfred E. Barlow of New York,Engineering News 29 Feb. 1912: 115. New York. it cost the club $100,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Over the course of the 20th century, the club's influence waned as the city grew more diverse and its industrial base declined. In the 1980s it eventually disbanded and the building became city property. Unoccupied, it decayed until 1999 when Decision Technologies International (DTI), a software consulting firm based in nearby Wappinger, reached a deal with the city to renovate the building and use it as its headquarters. The city committed $800,000 in urban-redevelopment grants to help the company. In 2002, almost a year and a half after DTI had last withdrawn funds from the account, the city moved to foreclose on the property since it believed DTI was not serious about redeveloping it and it had been approached by others who were. DTI insisted it was serious, and after first threatening to contest any action vigorously, agreed to waive certain defenses in exchange for a 30-day reprieve. The city formally commenced foreclosure actions early in 2003, with DTI's founder, Idoni Matthews, promising a court fight. In October it began work again. DTI completed the renovation works in 2004, the city granted DTI a Certificate of Occupancy. The building currently home of DTI's corporate headquarter and software development laboratory.

The album departs from the eclectic soundtrack-to-an-imaginary-film style of his previous studio albums, in favour of a more personal approach. It was nominated for the 2008 Choice Music Prize, awarded to the best Irish album of the year. The tracks \\"I Heard Wonders\\" and \\"Holy Pictures\\" were released as singles.  Critical reception  The album has garnered generally favourable reviews, and is seen as a successful departure from its predecessors. Thom Jurek, writing for AllMusic, called it \\"engaging, at times stunning\\", praising the pop aesthetic of the upbeat songs, while remarking that \\"there is that sadness at this album's heart that draws one in; it doesn't feel like mope or exorcism, just personal\\". Pitchfork Media added that the closing three songs \\"seek to recapture a certain back-to-the-womb comfort... and prove an affecting come- down to the preceding songs' sunglasses-at-night swagger\\". Both critics praised the final song, \\"The Ballad of Sarah and Jack\\", referring to it as \\"gorgeous\\" and \\"unspeakably somber\\". Jurek also favoured the opener, \\"I Heard Wonders\\", calling it a \\"killer track\\". The album was seen as reflecting many influences, most notably The Jesus and Mary Chain (particularly Jim Reid's vocal style), Primal Scream and Neu! in its upbeat songs and Brian Eno in its \\"warm production\\" and \\"limpid, wistful instrumentals\\".

Rothovius' twin brother, Jonas Rothovius, was the Superintendent of Kalmar from 1618 till 1626. Finnish postage stamp, 1933 Education Rothovius at several upper secondary schools and in 1595 went to Uppsala, where in 1597 he became a teacher to the brothers Axel Oxenstierna, Krister Oxenstierna and Gabriel Oxenstierna, with whom he went to Germany that same year and visited the universities in Rostock and Wittenberg. While in Wittenberg, Rothovius acquired a Master of Philosophy in 1602. He was also ordained a priest in 1602. Later he returned to his homeland and was appointed in 1603 to be vicar of Nyköping, where he remained until 1627. Bishop In 1627 he was appointed as Bishop of Turku, however he did not speak Finnish when he arrived in Turku. He also considered the Finns (especially during the early years of his term) to be barbaric. Bishop Rothovius forced the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church and its priests to change several of their customs, such as reading different Bible passages from different sides of the church, and wearing colourful garments, which reminded him of Finland's Roman Catholic past. Bishop Rothovius's most notable achievements were his help in speeding up the translation of the entire Bible into Finnish (completed in 1642), and in changing the Turku Cathedral School into the Gymnasium of Turku (an upper secondary school) in 1630, and in supporting the establishment of the Academy of Turku (now the University of Turku) in 1640.Tarkiainen, Kari. \\"Isaac Rothovius\\", Swedish biographical dictionary.

It is based on two ideas. The first idea is that goods purchased by consumers will be cohesive to their sense of identity, and as a result, will be complementary to one another. The second idea states that the introduction of a new possession that is deviant from the consumer's current complementary goods can result in a process of spiraling consumption. The term was coined by anthropologist and scholar of consumption patterns Grant McCracken in 1988, and is named after the French philosopher Denis Diderot (1713–1784), who first described the effect in an essay. The term has become common in discussions of sustainable consumption and green consumerism, in regard to the process whereby a purchase or gift creates dissatisfaction with existing possessions and environment, provoking a potentially spiraling pattern of consumption with negative environmental, psychological, and social impacts. Origin Diderot in red gown, by Dmitry Levitzky, 1773 The effect was first described in Diderot's essay \\"Regrets on Parting with My Old Dressing Gown\\". Here he tells how the gift of a beautiful scarlet dressing gown leads to unexpected results, eventually plunging him into debt. Initially pleased with the gift, Diderot came to rue his new garment. Compared to his elegant new dressing gown, the rest of his possessions began to seem tawdry and he became dissatisfied that they did not live up to the elegance and style of his new possession. He replaced his old straw chair, for example, with an armchair covered in Moroccan leather; his old desk was replaced with an expensive new writing table; his formerly beloved prints were replaced with more costly prints, and so on. \\"I was absolute master of my old dressing gown\\", Diderot writes, \\"but I have become a slave to my new one … Beware of the contamination of sudden wealth. The poor man may take his ease without thinking of appearances, but the rich man is always under a strain\\". Usage In McCracken's usage the Diderot effect is the result of the interaction between objects within \\"product complements\\", or \\"Diderot unities\\", and consumers. A Diderot unity is a group of objects that are considered to be culturally complementary, in relation to one another. For example, items of clothing, furniture, vehicles, etc. McCracken describes that a consumer is less likely to veer from a preferred Diderot unity in order to strive towards unity in appearance and representation of one's social role. However, it can also mean that if an object that is somehow deviant from the preferred Diderot unity is acquired, it may have the effect of causing the consumer to start subscribing to a completely different Diderot unity. Sociologist and economist Juliet Schor uses the term in her best selling 1992 book The Overspent American: Why We Want What We Don't Need to describe processes of competitive, status-conscious consumption driven by dissatisfaction. Schor's 2005 essay \\"Learning Diderot’s Lesson: Stopping the Upward Creep of Desire\\" describes the effect in contemporary consumer culture in the context of its negative environmental consequences.

It is about west of the village of Tisbury. Described as a \\"fine classical house\\", Pythouse is set in parkland with a ha-ha separating the formal house lawn from surrounding parkland on which livestock may graze. It has an Ionic portico, and the front elevation may have inspired the design of Philipps House at nearby Dinton, which was begun in 1813 and designed by Sir Jeffry Wyatville. Leigh Court in Somerset was later built to the plans used for Pythouse. House and parkland, from the road to the south History In about 1225 the land was given to the Pyt family (pronounced pit) by the abbess of Shaftesbury. Until about 1651 the Pyts lived on the estate, until they were forced to sell in order to pay fines levied against them by Parliament following the Civil War, as they had supported the Royalists in the war. At this time the family name had been changed to Bennett, maybe as homage to the Benedictine Abbey of Shaftesbury. After the Civil war, the house was bought by the Grove family, friends of the Pyt/Bennett family. In about 1707 the Groves sold it to the Benett family, who were related to the original Bennetts by marriage. About 1725 the current Pythouse was built, replacing an earlier Elizabethan house. In 1805 the house was altered by John Benett (1773–1852), the owner and amateur architect, who \\"Palladianized\\" it with the help of architect Thomas Hopper. In 1891, rear service wings were added.  20th and 21st centuries  Estate entrance with lion statues on top of gateposts The house remained in the Benett family until the mid-1950s, when death duties forced its sale. The house was then owned for 46 years by the Country Houses Association, a charity which ran it as a retirement home. In 1966 the house was designated as Grade II* listed and in 1990 the small chapel in the grounds, built around 1827 by John Benett, received the same designation. In 2004 Pythouse (together with of land) was sold for £7 million and is once more a private home.

The artificial lake created as a result of the construction of the dam is known as the Taisetsu Lake.  Overview  The Ishikari River Comprehensive development plan was formulated in 1947. The plan included a number of dam projects along the main tributaries which resulted in the construction of Ashibetsu Dam as well as Nakayama Dam. In 1954, Typhoon No. 15 known as caused damage to the trees in the Kamikawa Basin, as well as many roads in the surrounding area. A survey of the Ishikari River was conducted and in 1955 and construction of the dam began in 1965. The dam was completed in 1975 after 10 years of construction and has allowed for greater control of flooding and supplies up to 20,000 kW of hydropower. In 1981, another major flood occurred and caused considerable damage to the region. The revision of the Ishikari River comprehensive development plan was required which led to the planning and creation of more dams. In 2007, the Chubetsu Dam was completed as part of this project.

Their intelligent lighting fixtures are commonly used in theatre, concerts, television, film and corporate events. History = Pre-history = The origins of Vari-Lite date to the late 1960s, when college friends Jack Calmes and Rusty Brutsché played together in a Texas-based blues band. They built a sound system for their shows that attracted the attention of other acts, who asked to rent it from them. In March 1970, Calmes and Brutsché, together with sound engineer Jack Maxson, incorporated Showco, with the intention of supplying sound systems to regional rock concerts. The company initially operated two sound systems and two trucks from Maxson's garage. The company quickly grew, both in size and reputation, and added lighting equipment to its inventory in 1972. By the end of the 1970s, Showco's lighting equipment was becoming outdated, and the company could not afford to replace it. =Invention= In 1980, Showco engineer Jim Bornhorst discovered that twisting dichroic filters alters the frequencies of light filtered, resulting in an apparent color change. The company exploited this discovery by constructing a fixture equipped with two motors to move the light. An initial prototype of a fully automated lighting system, featuring a General Electric Marc 350 projector, was built in twelve weeks. Showco representatives demonstrated the prototype—known today as the VL-Zero—to members of the British band Genesis, having programmed it to enact two simple cues. Genesis, already a regular Showco client, immediately invested $1 million in the new technology, although a working model, later known as the VL1, would not be available until the band embarked on its Abacab tour. Showco used the capital to develop the control console, power distribution, and digital data transmission equipment required to implement the sound system. =Growth and expansion= The company subsequently incorporated as Vari-Lite Inc. and struck distribution deals to introduce the product into international markets. The Series 200 system launched in 1987, featuring the Artisan Control Console and two new luminaires: the VL2—a direct descendant of the VL1—and the VL3, based on the VL-Zero. This was followed by the VL4, a more compact and brighter version of the VL3, and two upgrades of the original VL2: the VL2B and the VL2C. A smaller backup console was also launched, called the Mini- Artisan. In 1994, Vari-lite set up Irideon Inc. to manufacture automated lighting products for the architectural lighting market, selling it off to Electronic Theatre Controls four years later. In 1997 the company floated on Nasdaq (NASDAQ:LITE), selling two million shares, in a move which allowed the company to retire almost half its debt. Forty-seven percent of the company remained in the hands of Genesis and Vari-Lite management. The company then began to buy back the franchises it had created in previous years in favor of establishing new rental offices that offered conventional third-party lighting equipment alongside its own products. In 2002, the VARI*LITE luminaire manufacturing and sales divisions were sold to the Genlyte Group. The rental division, retaining the console division, and continued to develop the Virtuoso product line, eventually merging with the Production Resource Group (PRG) in 2004. In early 2008, the Genlyte Group was bought by Royal Philips Lighting. Under Philips ownership, the VLX wash, a high-intensity LED luminaire, was developed. Having separated from its parent company Royal Philips, Philips Lighting rebrands as Signify in 2019. Vari-Lite and stablemate Strand regain their stand-alone brand status, with a renewed commitment from the business to innovate and support the visions of creative artists worldwide. =Accolades= The company has won three Primetime Emmy Awards for technical achievement: in 1991, for Outstanding Achievement in Engineering, in the development of the Series 200 system; in 1994, for the development of the VL5; and in 2001 for Outstanding Achievement in Engineering for the Virtuoso console. =Patent infringement lawsuits= In 1989 Vari-Lite sued Syncrolite, Inc. and founder, former Showco president Jack Calmes, over alleged patent infringements. Calmes countersued, claiming that his former business partners had kept the development of the Vari-Lite system from him at the time of his departure, causing him to lose money when he sold his Showco stock. The case was resolved in Vari-Lite's favour. In August 1995 Vari-lite sued High End Systems, seeking unspecified damages and an injunction against the manufacture of the Status Cue system, including the Cyberlight and Studio Color luminaires. The matter was eventually resolved out of court. In 1999, Vari-lite obtained a preliminary injunction against Danish firm Martin Gruppen A/S, which barred the import, sale and lease of several lighting products within the United States. Martin responded by releasing updated products that lay outside the scope of Vari-Lite's patents. Control systems From the very start, Vari*Lite consoles were computerised, transmitting digital multiplexed signals to the luminaires. =Series 100= Originally known simply as The Vari-lite System, Series 100 used a patented protocol based on RS-422, which sent positional, beam and colour information, via a rack-mounted computer, to up to 32 individual Vari-lite luminaires (later known as VL1s), at up to 30 times a second. Up to three computers could be linked together under the control of a single console, giving a maximum system size of 96 luminaires. The transmissions were unidirectional, and the error checking was quite rudimentary, checking each transmission bit 5 times and applying the majority result. As the information was retransmitted multiple times each second, the result was no noticeable errors by the luminaires. However, the refresh rate of a full 96 channel system was visibly noticeable if, the low- numbered channels were rigged close to high-numbered channels (in Vari*Lite jargon, a \\"channel\\" referred to a whole device, regardless of how many parameters it had). In order to distribute both power and data, 6 channel \\"dumb\\" repeater boxes were used. The cables carried both data and power. In order to meet safety standards, the data cable was rated at 600 v, to allow it to be used in 3 phase power applications. The channel number (also known as an address) was set with three thumbwheel switches on each lite and a common practical joke on the part of non-Vari-lite crew, would be to renumber random \\"lites\\" (this became a common way of referring to a Vari*Lite unit on both sides of the Atlantic). The designation Series 100 was not applied until 1987, upon the release of the Series 200 system. =Series 200= By contrast, the Series 200 system was designed to employ a proprietary, bidirectional protocol. Each luminaire became \\"intelligent\\"—storing its own positional, beam and colour information, and reacting to a global \\"memory cue\\" command, so every luminaire reacted simultaneously (see US Patent No.5010459). This overcame the limitations imposed by the processor power available at the time, on the maximum number of luminaires that could be controlled from one console. The Series 200 system was introduced in 1987 and featured the VL2 and VL3 luminaires, controlled by the Artisan console, with power and data distributed to dumb repeater boxes by an ACS Rack. The repeaters gained three more outputs, making nine in total. Up to seven repeater boxes (63 luminaires) could be supplied by one ACS rack. Multiple ACS racks could be linked together, data-wise, with one acting as a master and the other as slaves. Manchester encoding was used to improve transmission resilience and a polling system was introduced to get feedback (known as Reply Data) from each luminaire. Damaged cables and \\"chattering\\" lites could cause problems in larger systems, as they introduced noise into the reply data lines running back to the Artisan console, causing luminaires to appear offline. Although this did not normally affect the playback of cues, it could cause severe problems when trying to save and backup the system data onto the 1.44Mb, 3.5 inch floppy discs that were standard at the time. Under Series 200, the number of controllable channels (i.e. luminaires) was increased—at least on paper—to 1000; but in reality, the practical maximum was around 400. The reason for this discrepancy, was that if a luminaire had not been polled for (and had therefore not sent) its reply data within a certain time, it would become regarded as \\"offline\\" by the Artisan console. In a system of over 400 luminaires, the limitations of the hardware in the Artisan, meant that it was not possible for the console to poll all the luminaires within the allotted time. The performance of the Series 200 system was greatly improved over its working life, through a rolling program of upgrades, modifications and retrofits. Central to these were the various software versions, which progressively refined the programming features available to Artisan console operators. The VL4 wash luminaire was officially added to the Series 200 luminaire range in 1991. =Series 300= By the end of the 1980s, the market for moving lights was firmly established—a market which had arguably been created single-handedly by Vari-lite themselves. However, the high cost of renting a Vari-lite system and the fact that they could only be programmed from an Artisan console, by a specially trained operator, were barriers to full realisation of market potential. Additionally, despite the protection afforded to Vari-lite technology through the use of patents, rival manufacturers were beginning to market competing moving lights; along with consoles which could control their functions using the DMX512 protocol. There were also general market concerns regarding the overall size and weight of moving lights in general, which limited the number of them that could be hung on a lighting rig and made them impractical for many small / medium scale productions. The Series 300 system was developed to address these issues. Series 300 was not strictly a new protocol, but a development of Series 200 that moved most of the processing away from the luminaires and into the repeater box, thus creating the Vari-lite \\"Smart Repeater\\" (VLSR—see US Patent Nos. 5209560 and 5329431). The VLSR is able to distinguish between Vari-lite Series 200 and DMX512 data signals, and can be controlled with either—although not both simultaneously (merging). Having identified the type of incoming control signal, the VLSR converts it into Series 300 data; which it sends to the luminaires, along with the 24V power lines required to drive the motors. Up to six Series 300 luminaires can be controlled via one VLSR, using Series 300 Smart Lamp Runs (SLR) When controlled by a Series 200 data signal, the VLSR stored the cue information (in much the same way that Series 200 luminaires did) and transmitted the raw positional and colour information to the luminaires, as Series 300 data. In this case, the Series 200 input connector was used to supply both power and data. When controlled by a DMX512 data signal, all cue information is stored in and transmitted from the lighting console; with the VLSR simply acting as a translating device, which converts the DMX signal to Series 300 data in real time. In this case, the Series 200 input connector is used only to supply mains power to the VLSR, with DMX data being input via a separate, standard, 5-pin XLR connector. The first Series 300 luminaire was the VL5 wash, released in late 1992, along with the VLSR. The VL6 spot luminaire was released in 1994 and the VL7 in 1998; with updated variants of all luminaires being developed, following their respective, initial releases. Control consoles =Series 100 Prototype Control Console= Only one of these was ever built, and only had two control sections: Direct Cueing, where a memory number was entered on the keypad, assigned to the direct window and triggered by pressing the Go button, and Cross-Fade where two memories could be assigned to opposite ends of a pair of faders, and the luminaries would transition between cues. Each of the circuit cards in the system as well as the backplane of the system was hand wired, and the first operator, Dave Berger, one of the technicians who had built the unit, would take it out on tour with The Who and later with Paul Anka with the original seventeen 1st generation lites. The system was also used on The Kinks tour in 1983, then retired as new Series 100 Consoles and luminaires were built. =Series 100 Control Console= The production version of the Series 100 console was never given a name and was generally referred to as, \\"the Vari-lite console\\". It now boasted four control methods: Direct, X-Fade, Chase and Matrix. Chase allowed a consecutive number of cues to be run automatically, although the speed had to be set by hand, and matrix allowed you to program some cues to have their intensity levels split into eight groups. The total cue storage was 256 cues, with sixteen assigned to the matrix. The remaining 239 could be used by any of the other control methods. In addition, there were two banks of sixteen programmable colour buttons, called \\"Preset Colours\\", and the active control of the luminaires could be divided into two banks of sixteen groups. Later software versions allowed \\"Selective Store\\" and a quirk in the software allowed you to completely wipe a cue memory in a group of lites, and then only store the colour or beam information. Triggering a cue saved in this way would simply overlay the colour or beam information of a lite without changing its position. By 1986/87 it was common to see a good operator using both direct and x-fade controls overlaid by a selectively stored colour or beam chase at the same time. =Artisan Control Console= The Vari-Lite Artisan console was a quantum leap beyond the Series 100 console. Physically it was much larger and heavier at 210 lbs. (96 kg) with an ergonomic front panel. The lower surface was at shallow angle and the upper surface inclined greater for programming comfort. Initially system interface was through one proprietary multi- connector \\"snake\\" cable that was connected to the ACS rack. Typically two control snakes were run to provide backup should one fail. One of the great differences in the Series 200 and Series 100 communication data was the bi-directional communication of the Artisan console and connected Series 200 luminaries. VL2s, VL3s and VL4s could report function status of digital hardware (pass, fail), bulb status (on, off), lamp power supply (normal, short, open), function status of fixture mechanisms and over-temperature indications of fixture. Fixture control was split into four different parameters now. Intensity, Color, Focus and Beam were integral to the programming and playback sections. Each parameter had at least one encoder wheel on the far left of the front panel next to preset buttons associated with each parameter for a total of seven wheels. Pan and tilt had separate larger encoder wheels with greater resolution. There were 20 preset buttons on 4 pages for focus, color and gobo. Below each preset button section there was a backlit area for a strip of vellum on which programmers could write labels. Shift buttons next to intensity, color and beam were later utilized to access sub-sets of attributes. Oddly, the beam parameter presets only stored gobo information so programmers had to manually set iris and frost to store to cues. Photo of Artisan console. Above the programming section on the inclined panel to the left was the fixture select panel. An intimidating array of 100 buttons numbered 1 through 100 were for fixture selection. To the left of those were another column of 10 buttons labeled 1, 100, 200, etc. Those were to access the next level of fixtures giving the console 1000 fixture capability which was unheard of at that time. To the right of the select buttons were the group select buttons. The fixture select buttons also gave the programmer intensity state and online status through button back light states (dimmed, illuminated or flashing). Selecting and deselecting fixtures could be a physically demanding process on larger shows. Sometimes described as swimming the English channel. In the center upper panel was an LCD screen to display fixture icons. A vast improvement over the Series 100 small outboard CRT screen, it nonetheless was deleted on the Artisan Plus for an attached Macintosh with screen. Fixture intensity states and online status mimicked the fixture selection buttons as well as displaying timing states. That screen was also integral to fixture patch by assigning fixture types, fixture numbers and thumb wheel addresses. The lower center section was dedicated to a numeric keypad grand master and playback faders. Playback opportunities were vastly improved with a two cross-fader masters, two direct masters, two chase masters and matrix master. Recorded cues were assigned to faders, the fader selected (made active) and then brought up to intensity. Each master could be masked using an interesting four segment button labeled IFBC above each fader. Programmers could have cues played back with only intensity active (for example) even though all parameters had been recorded. It is important to note that the Artisan console recorded everything, all the time unlike today's tracking consoles which only record parameter changes (in the simplest applications). However, to be recorded in a cue on Artisan, any fixture had to have an intensity state of - any intensity percentage above zero, at zero or marked (blacked out but ready). Fixtures that had the intensity state of out were not recorded in the cue and went to a null state (all parameters at default). A good programmer could easily spot a well programmed show when all the fixtures had good marking prior to becoming active in a cue or remained inert when not use during a succession of cues. Fixture parameters could also be filtered out of cues by using selective store. Especially useful in chase cues which were to be played back in addition to whole cues in direct masters. On the right side were the Chase and Matrix panels. The Matrix contained 20 faders that allowed for 50 patches to assign all 1000 channels. Those patches were assigned to the matrix faders and gave the programmer intensity control for groups of fixtures within a cue. Very useful for flashing manually as there were bump buttons above each matrix fader. The Chase control had up to 200 chases containing any sequence of cues and direction of cue execution and rate was programmable. However, each step of a chase was an individual cue and programming extensive chase sequences was very challenging and tedious. Above those sections was the board control window which was used to record cue data, start and douse fixtures in addition to other commands. =Mini Artisan Control Console= =Mini Artisan 2 Control Console= =Virtuoso Control Console= Luminaires =Prototypes= VL-Zero The prototype VL- Zero (VL0) was a dichroic colour fading wash unit. The original is still in semi-working condition at PRG. The colour change mechanism worked by twisting dichroic filters into and out of the beam path. This design proved impractical for the profile spot-type optics of the unit planned, but the idea was later revived in the company's wash luminaires, beginning with the VL3. =Series 100 luminaires= VL1 The VL1 (Series 100) used dichroic filter, mounted onto three wheels with seven filters each, plus an open position. A fourth wheel was fitted with five beam apertures and two gobos. Pan and Tilt used servo motors, and intensity was controlled by an iris at the front of the head. The Upper Enclosure (UPE—the \\"box\\" on which a moving head is mounted) contained the power supply for the lamp (the APS250) and a Data Receiver Card—a PCB which translated the cue information received from the console into low voltages; these were then (mostly) sent via a wiring harness to a servo amplifier card in the head, which provided the actual power that drove the motors. The Data Receiver Card also translated the lamp Start and Douse commands from the console and fed them to the APS, allowing the lamps to be switched on and off remotely, by the console operator. The original choice of lamp—the GE Marc 350 projector lamp, a discharge lamp with a daylight colour temperature caused several problems and a less powerful, 250W lamp had to be substituted. The Osram HTI 250 was selected as the replacement lamp for the new VL2 after the company experienced significant troubles with the original GE MARC350 lamp. Quality issues led to limited supplies of the lamp being available and the company did not want to base a new product on the MARC350. Vari-Lite eventually tried the HTI 250 in the VL1s for the same reason, lack of supply of good MARC350 lamps. They also tested the Philips MSD 250 lamp in the VL1 with some success. They had a projected lifetime of >1000 hrs, but by that time the VL1s were nearing retirement. 860 units were built between 1981 and 1984. Most of them were destroyed, but some four units are reported to still survive, two at PRG and two built from spares are in private hands. Some units were stolen, and may also still survive. =Series 200 luminaires= VL2 / VL2B / VL2C /VL2D  The VL2 was a moving head spot luminaire, designed to replace the VL1 and make use of the bi-directional communication afforded by the Series 200 system. In addition to Pan, Tilt and Intensity, the VL2 featured two colour wheels, with 16 positions each (15 dichroic filters plus one open position for white—see US Patent 4800474.) There was one (non- rotating) gobo wheel with 10 positions (9 gobos plus 1 open). The gobos could be easily swapped for custom designs—unlike the VL1. The gobos were mostly made from aluminium, fixed to a plastic stalk, but Vari-lite also developed a new type of glass gobo for use with the VL2 (see US Patent 4779176). There were two other new beam functions: A beam iris to alter the diameter of the beam and a movable, multi-element front lens to sharpen or soften the beam edge. The VL2 used an HTI-250 arc source, similar to that in the VL1, driven by an updated APS250 lamp power supply. To this day, few—if any—automated spot luminaires, have been able to match the speed of colour and gobo change achieved by the Vari-lite VL2 and its direct descendants. As with all Vari- lite products, the VL2 range was subject to a rolling programme of improvements and retrofits, designed to increase the reliability of what was still, in many ways, cutting-edge technology. In particular, the design of the original APS lamp power supply was notoriously unreliable but was ultimately cured by the application of the \\"X-mod\\" upgrade, which—with additional tweaks to the lamp ignitor card—vastly reduced the number of APS-related and lamp strike problems. Upgraded APS units were suffixed with \\"-X\\". The VL2B saw the light source upgraded to a HTI-400SE, short arc discharge lamp, driven by the upgraded APS400 PSU. A very pale blue dichroic filter was replaced with 3200°K tungsten correction and the beam iris motor replaced with one of a higher resolution. VL2B luminaires can be distinguished by the absence of ventilation louvres on the rear panel of the head; which were replaced by a hinged panel, through which to access the new lamp base for bulb changes and line-up. The VL2C further upgraded the light source to 600 W, driven by an APS600-X lamp PSU. The internal ventilation system was accordingly redesigned to better cool the head—especially the colour / gobo wheels and the beam iris leaves were upgraded for better heat resistance. The speed of the cooling fan was also increased—which led to some complaints (especially from TV studios) about noise. Detachable, external baffles were designed to cover the ventilation grilles in the side of the luminaire's Upper Enclosure (UPE), in order to deal with this issue; but could occasionally cause overheating in warm environments, leading to lamp shutdown. The VL2C also featured an upgraded processor board, to better handle the demands made by extra features offered in later versions of the Series 200 operating system software, such as the application of timing values (rather than a simple speed) to the various functions. The VL2C can be outwardly distinguished by the presence of ventilation louvres to the rear of the top and bottom head covers and by a smaller, hinged colour / gobo access hatch, secured by a quarter-turn Zeus clip (previous versions featured a sliding hatch). In the late 1990s, a modification was applied to the VL2C, which allowed it to be controlled from DMX512 lighting consoles, via a Vari-lite Smart DMX unit. In the UK, the remaining VL2Cs were eventually sold off to various lighting rental companies. Some may still be in existence, other than any kept for exhibition / archive units; but the difficulty of sourcing spare parts means that a significant hire stock is unlikely to be maintained in the long term. VL2D: With the end of production of the 600HTI lamp, some vl2C was converted by EML/PRG with 700MSR lamp. VL3 The Vari-lite VL3 was the company's first attempt to create a moving head wash luminaire, designed overall to light larger areas of a stage with softer-edged beams of light; in contrast with the tighter, often hard-edged beams produced by spot luminaires. The VL3 was built to complement the VL2 spot luminaire and released at the same time, in 1987, as a part of the (then) new Series 200 system. Externally, the luminaire was of an identical size and design to the VL2, save for the presence of a larger (6\\" / 150 mm), convex, slightly frosted lens—its key distinguishing feature. A wider range of lenses, with a variety of beam angles mimicking those found in PAR64 lamps, had been originally planned, but was not implemented on the VL3. The idea was later revived for the VL5. Internally, the VL3 marked a return to the original idea of using twisting dichroic filters, to gradually vary the colour of the beam (see US Patent 4602321). This was made practical by the simpler optics employed in a wash luminaire, which do not produce the same beam artifacts that the optics of a spot luminaire would, using this type of colour change mechanism. The subtractive, CMY (Cyan Magenta Yellow) colour mixing system designed for the VL3, featured three sets of three dichroic filters, each set independently rotatable; with the cyan filters at the rear, closest to the lamp and the magenta filters to the front. In their \\"open\\" position, the filters sat edge-on to the axis of the light beam, so that only white light emerged. By rotating the filter sets into the path of the beam, a wide variety of colours could be created—from light pastel shades, to deep saturated hues. A similar mechanism, with three, frosted glass vanes in place of dichroic filters, sat in front of the colour mechanism and was used to provide variable beam diffusion / width control, from a narrow spot to a wide flood. Further beam width control was introduced, with the motorisation of the lamp base; which allowed it to be moved through the reflector, along the beam axis. Another, major departure from the VL1 and VL2, was the use of a custom- made, tungsten lamp as the light source, which ran at a maximum of 53 volts and consumed 475 Watts. This was dimmed by a new type of lamp power supply—the IPS, with I standing for Induction, instead of Arc. Despite allowing lighting designers and programmers to create the kind of gradual colour changes and soft-edged washes which were unachievable with the VL1 and VL2, the VL3 was not a long term success; mainly due to the tungsten lamp not being bright enough to handle longer throws, especially when set in darker colours. This compromised its ability to provide frontal illumination, reducing its role to mostly backlighting and beam effects. The VL3 began to be replaced by the VL4 from 1991. There may be a one or two left in existence, for exhibition / archive purposes, but the vast majority had been converted to VL2B luminaires by the end of 1994, which in turn were later upgraded to VL2Cs. A large number of VL3 luminaires can be seen surrounding the central, circular screen, in videos of Pink Floyd's Delicate Sound of Thunder tour. VL4 Marketed under the strapline, Smaller, Lighter, Faster, Brighter, the Vari-lite VL4 was the company's second moving head wash luminaire, designed to replace and improve upon the VL3. It was first made available for rental in 1990. At roughly half the size and weight of its predecessor, the VL4 did much to address market concerns regarding the size and weight of moving lights in general. A customised 400W short arc discharge lamp, updated from the one employed in the VL2B and coupled with a chemically brightened aluminium reflector, ensured that the output far exceeded that of the disappointing VL3. The subtractive, CMY colour change mechanism was a reduced-size version of the one used in the VL3, but beam diffusion was handled by a tambour-inspired design; with motor-driven, vertical slats of increasingly diffuse glass, that were drawn (internally) across the front end of the luminaire from both sides (see US Patent No. 4972306). As with the VL3, further beam width control was achieved by moving the motorised lamp back and forth inside the reflector, along the beam axis. Intensity control was provided via a mechanical shutter (the discharge lamp being non-dimmable). A second, \\"strobe\\" shutter, designed to snap open and closed as fast as possible, was incorporated into the intensity mechanism. The VL4 also featured a 12-bit Motorola processor, over the 8-bit one used in the VL2 and VL3. Despite being a technical improvement over the VL3, the small size and compact design of the VL4 led to a number of reliability issues—particularly with overheating. The densely constructed and relatively front-heavy head of the luminaire was also prone to overshooting (and then bouncing back to) its intended position at the end of fast movements. Many problems were addressed in a major upgrade programme, carried out over several weeks in the early 1990s, which featured over 135 modifications to the design. These ranged from the simple placement of a blob of rubber sealant somewhere in the luminaire, to the wholesale stripping down, extensive modification and total rebuilding of the Pan and Tilt mechanisms, to combat the overshooting problem. The new, compacted design of the APS400 lamp power supply suffered similar problems to the earlier APS power supplies, although these were mostly cured with the eventual application of the \\"X-mod\\". Ultimately, the small size of the luminaire made it impossible to upgrade the light source to a brighter, 600 Watt lamp (as had been done with the VL2C upgrade). Increasingly bright, competing luminaires from rival manufacturers, coupled with continuing reliability issues and high maintenance costs, saw the VL4 largely replaced by the VL5 within a decade of the latter's release. Very few remained in service beyond the first years of the 21st century and fewer still are in existence today, except maybe a couple held for exhibition / archive purposes. =Series 300 luminaires= VL5 / VL5 ARC / VL5B The VL5 was the third moving head wash luminaire to be produced by Vari-lite and was released in September 1992. It uses the Dichro-Tune radial CMY color mixing system (see US Patents 5073847 and 5186536). This system gives smoother transitions between colours and more even pastel shades, than that used in the VL3 and VL4; but is slower in end-to-end travel and gives the fixture the unmistakable black dot at the front of the fixture. A fourth set of vanes carry diffused glass to soften / widen the beam. Unlike the VL4, there is no other beam control; although the native beam angle can be pre-set using interchangeable lenses, which mimic the beam angles found in PAR64 lamps (an idea first proposed for the VL3). Design-wise, the VL5 responded to calls from entertainment lighting designers, for lighter, simpler, more reliable and (above all) cheaper moving light technology, which did not have to be controlled by a proprietary console. It was the first Series 300 luminaire, which could be controlled by either Vari-lite Series 200 data, or DMX512-A data, via a Vari-lite Smart Repeater (VLSR) box. Whichever data type was used, the mains voltage tungsten lamp used in the VL5 is dimmed remotely; using standard, stage lighting dimmer technology. This considerably reduced the cost of the luminaire and removed the need for a large upper enclosure, it being possible to incorporate the remaining electronics in the yoke of the unit. The lamp itself was an updated design by Philips, strengthened to withstand the forces on the white-hot filament caused by high-speed movement of the head. The VL5 was the first moving light to use \\"cold mirror\\" technology to provide a cool, high-intensity light beam, which could be placed close to objects and people, without burning them. The VL5s reflector is, in fact, a very large dichroic filter, which only allows infra-red light to pass through it, while reflecting the remaining visible light forward. The idea had been in use for some time before, most notably in MR16 halogen downlighter lamps, but never scaled up to this level. The prototype VL5 cold mirror reflector allegedly cost US$100,000 to produce. The idea works well in producing a cool beam output, but can raise the rear end of the head to flesh-searing temperatures, after just a few minutes' operation at maximum intensity. The VL5 was the first convection-cooled moving light, requiring no fan and therefore producing almost no noise. This has made it a popular choice for television lighting and other noise-sensitive applications. The VL5 Arc introduced a 575W discharge lamp to the design. As this could not be electronically dimmed, the diffuser vanes were replaced with black metal ones, which acted as a mechanical dimmer. Beam width control was initially carried out using an innovative \\"Liquid Lens\\"—again designed by Jim Bornhorst (see US Patent 5774273)—which pumped a liquid silica-based gel into a series of lentil-shaped cavities, set between two plastic membranes—thus altering their refractive index and giving a variable beam angle of 13–34°. However, this range fell short of that originally promised in the R&D; stage and was not generally wide enough, to be useful for creating the kind of broad washes of soft-edged light, normally expected by users from this class of luminaire. The liquid lens fell further out of favour, after some users obtained the MSDS for the gel being used in the lens and expressed concerns at its potential toxicity. Following this, many VL5 Arcs were rented out without the liquid lens, using instead the same, fixed-focus range of lenses designed for the original VL5. The original VL5 had offered a wider range of green shades than the VL4, but enabling it to do so had compromised its ability to produce pale, daylight and \\"steel\\" shades of blue—which are more useful to lighting designers, especially those working in Theatre and TV. The VL5B featured an alternative filter set, which restored the ability to produce pale blues, but reduced the overall number of useful colours available—especially darker, more saturated shades in the blue-green range. As a result, the VL5B is mostly used in Theatre and TV productions, where its specialised colour range is more often specifically required. The VL5B uses the same, 1000W tungsten lamp as the original VL5, powered by remote dimmers. The VL5 has proved to be Vari-lite's most long-lived product and is one of the most popular stage lighting units, of any kind, ever made—with over 3,500 built. Its simple workings, ease of maintenance and overall reliability, have made it a favourite among lighting crews for almost twenty years and—as of 2010—it is still readily available for hire from a number of rental companies; continuing to illuminate stages around the world. The smooth, elegant, early-1990s design—informed by the classic PAR64 Parcan lantern—has not dated appreciably and still looks \\"current\\" when used alongside more modern equipment—to the extent that the basic look of the head has been carried (along with that of the VL6), into many, post-Series 300 Vari-lite luminaires. VL6 / VL6B / VL6C / VL6C Plus The Vari-lite VL6 was designed to complement the VL5, as a simple, lightweight, cheap-to-hire, moving head spot luminaire; but did not appear on the market until mid-1994—almost two years after the VL5. As a Series 300 luminaire, it could be controlled either by Vari-lite Series 200 data or DMX512, via a Vari-lite Smart Repeater (VLSR) unit. The unusual \\"cyclops\\" design carried just two wheels: one for colour and one for gobos, each with 12 positions (including 1 open). The dichroic filters and gobos in the VL6 were interchangeable between the two wheels. With gobos set in both wheels and placed in the beam path, it is possible to \\"morph\\" between them, by adjusting the focus of the motorised lens (See US Patent No. 5934794). Placing dichroic filters in both wheels, allows additional colours to be created beyond the basic palette afforded by a single wheel, although this potential has not been widely explored. A new process of laser-etching very high resolution designs, onto the very small glass gobos designed for the VL6, was developed and patented by Vari-lite (see US Patent No. 5728994). A custom HTI-400 discharge lamp was once again chosen for the light source, requiring mechanical dimming and fans to cool the head of the luminaire; although these were smaller and considerably quieter, than those used in previous luminaires. As with the VL5, a dichroic, \\"cold mirror\\" was used as the reflector. Like the VL5, the VL6 had no upper enclosure and a new, modular, rack-mounted version of the APS power supply (the APS6) was designed to remotely power the lamps, via VLSRs. Six APS6 units could be mounted in one rack at a time. A dimmer dimmer module (the C3) with the same overall form as the APS6 was also designed, with the intention of allowing the lamps of VL5s and VL6s to be powered together, from the same lamp PSU rack, via a common VLSR. However, in Europe, the limitations of the C3 circuitry meant that insufficient voltage could be produced, to raise the 230 V version of the VL5 lamp to its maximum possible intensity; leaving the output looking dim and yellow. There was also the potential for accidental connection of VL6 lamps to dimmed mains supplies on \\"mixed\\" VLSRs, which rendered the lamps instantly and permanently useless. As a result, VL5 lamps continued to be mostly driven by third party dimmers and VL6s by APS racks, with the two types of luminaire usually running on separate VLSRs. The lightweight design of the VL6, meant that much faster moves were possible than with previous Vari-lite spots; although this was compromised by the weight added in the VL6B upgrade. Performed in 1998, the VL6B upgrade added a wider aperture zoom lens, with a 13−35° range and an additional rotating gobo wheel, with 5+1 positions. This added considerable weight to the head of the luminaire and made it front- heavy, to the extent that a counterweight was required to provide balance and bolted to the outside of the rear of the head. The VL6C upgraded the light source to 600 W, with commensurate measures taken to improve head cooling, heat resistance and to upgrade the APS6 lamp power supplies. In December 2007, The Production Resource Group (PRG) completed an upgrade of their entire stock of 1,200 VL6C luminaires to accept a 700W short arc discharge lamp. Modifications to the airflow system were made to improve the reliability of circuit boards and motors, with upgraded wiring and connectors for all motors and pan/tilt mechanisms. Improvements to the ignitor reduced the hot restrike time from 8 minutes to 1 minute and a new lamp douse switch was fitted, to allow lamp power to be disconnected at the luminaire itself. This upgraded version of the VL6C is referred to as the VL6C Plus. VLM The VLM was a double-sided mirror mounted in a VL5 yoke, with the added twist that the mirror could spin continuously. Partially developed to counter the moving mirror effects of being able to produced a fat beam, and partly as a unique lighting effect, it was produced in limited numbers. VL7 / VL7B The VL7 spot luminaire marked a return to a much larger design. As a Series 300 luminaire, it could be controlled by either Series 200 data from an Artisan console, or DMX512 data from a third party lighting console, via a VLSR unit. The Philips MSR 700 SA lamp, with a colour temperature of 5600°K, was chosen for the light source and driven remotely, from newly upgraded APS6 lamp power supplies. In keeping with its predecessors, the VL7 featured a number of innovations. First and foremost (at least from a marketing point of view) was the CVF colour system. This featured neither wheels nor twisting filters, but rather a pair of comparatively large, oblong, dichroic filter plates, which could be moved in the vertical and horizontal plane. Each plate carried three basic shades, carefully graduated to merge across the longer, horizontal plane. In the vertical plane, the three basic shades were progressively etched away with lasers, so that they were fully saturated at the top, but completely clear at the bottom. One filter plate carried the colours red, green and blue; while the other carried cyan, magenta and yellow. US Patent Nos. 5825548 and 5969868 describe the concepts behind the CVF colour system. Both patents make mention of a colour wheel and a fixed position wheel was included in the finished luminaire. This could carry both colours and/or gobos, but was mostly used for the latter. There was also a rotating gobo wheel, with a total of six positions and a strobe shutter, which could run at up to 7.25 Hz. A further, more subtle innovation, saw the use of a new, collection optics system, that guaranteed a much flatter and more even beam than had been produced by previous Vari-lite luminaires, which were prone to \\"hot spots\\" if not set up correctly. The ideas behind this component of the VL7 were described in US Patent No. 6123436 The quest for optical excellence continued with the near projection-quality zoom lens; which featured an unprecedented 8:1 ratio, in the shape of a 5–40° beam angle range—a feature made more remarkable, by its highly compact design (see US Patent No. 6046861). Despite these innovations and Vari-lite's previous experience, development of the VL7 was fraught with problems; originally unveiled in 1997, it was not released onto the market until 1998. Behind schedule, over-budget and not fully tested, the initial run of VL7 luminaires immediately fell victim to a wide range of teething troubles, for which—in most cases—there was no immediate cure. This left technicians only able to replace failed parts, rather than fix the problems which were causing them to fail. For example: a problem in the CVF, which caused the teeth to soften and become stripped from the belts that drove the filter plates, was traced to their drive gears, which had been made of a material with a high Specific Heat Capacity. Once this was understood, the gears could be changed, but not before several hundred belts had already required replacement. Further problems with the CVF caused cracks to appear in the (expensive) filter plates, although this did not always immediately affect the quality of the beam output. Even when the CVF's mechanical bugs were cured, the fact remained that it often travelled through a range of green- coloured shades, in between the start and end colours of a change. Although all additive (RGB) or subtractive (CMY) will produce a tertiary colour—which may sometimes become visually dominant, in an aesthetically displeasing way—when cross-fading between a primary and secondary hue; it is always a product of and therefore more likely to harmonise with, the hues at the start and end of the colour change. Green was not regarded by users as a pleasant alternative to this and although a programming workaround was developed by operators, it was a time-consuming process to apply to multiple cues, that slowed down the speed of colour changes. The luminaire had been released before the new, Series 200 software version required to control it from an Artisan was completely ready and—to begin with—it could only be controlled as a DMX luminaire, from a non-Vari-lite console. Maintenance was complicated by the location of some sub-assemblies in the luminaire, the Pan unit proving especially difficult to replace. The VL7 also featured more cooling fans than previous Vari-lite luminaires—a total of four and despite marketing claims of \\"virtually silent operation\\", the noise they produced did not go unnoticed by users. The VL7B replaced the fixed colour / gobo wheel, with a four-leaf motorised shutter gate, which could be used to mask the edges of the beam and could be rotated by 50°. The maximum speed of the strobe shutter was also increased slightly, to 8 Hz. The VL7 design was not a long-lasting success—certainly when compared to its Series 300 stablemates. Its unwieldy shape, size, weight and noisiness, plus the difficulty of maintenance and early unreliability, combined to make it unpopular with lighting technicians, operators and designers alike. By this time and despite Vari-lite's vigorous defence of their patents, there was a ready choice of alternatives available from competing manufacturers, which offered the same functions and brighter outputs. Many—if not most VL7s—were eventually returned to the VLPS agencies by sub-distributors and rental associates, to be hired only if specifically requested for a production. =Series 500 luminaires= VL500 Wash / VL500 80V Wash / VL500A Wash / VL500D Wash =Series 1000 luminaires= VL1000 Arc ERS VL1000 Tungsten ERS / VL1000 Tungsten ERS w/Dimmer =Series 2000 luminaires= VL2000 Spot luminaire Similar to the VL2416, the VL2000 spot series was available for outright purchase rather than rental only. The range began with the VL2201 spot fixture in the early 2000s. VL2201 This was essentially a DMX version of the popular VL6b featuring an Upper Enclosure (UPE) housing the arc power supply for the MSR400 short arc lamp and low voltage supply for electronics and motors. The lightweight luminaire featured an 11+1 slot fixed gobo wheel, the same as the VL6 range, 5+1 slot rotating gobo wheel, edge control, 3:1 zoom, 11+1 slot colour wheel and single blade dimmer mechanism which could also function as a strobe. Similar to early series 200 and 300 fixtures, the colour and gobo wheel speed is exceptionally fast allowing for effects that can't be achieved with other brands of spot fixture. Electronic focus allows for morphing between gobos. The 2201 fixture has a smooth cold mirror reflector with lamp adjustment allowing for a flat or peaked beam. VL2202 The VL2202 luminaire was very similar to the VL6c fixture. Specification was the same as the VL2201 except it featured a 19-35 degree 3:1 zoom range, a faceted cold mirror reflector for a perfectly flat beam, and a MSR700 short arc lamp for higher output. Vari Lite produced an upgrade kit for 2201 fixtures to allow them to be converted to 2202 fixtures The VL2201 was discontinued and the VL2202 renamed as the \\"VL2000 Spot\\". VL2000 Wash luminaire The VL2000 Wash fixture began life as the VL2402. They were renamed as the VL2000 wash the same time as the spot range was renamed. The VL2000 wash is the same size and design as the spot range for a consistent hanging configuration across the range. The fixture features a MSR700 short arc lamp, the same exceptionally fast 11+1 slot colour wheel, as well as a three-wheel CYM colour mixing system to allow for a nearly unlimited range of colours. This more traditional wheel mixing system differs from the previous Vari Lite Dichro*Tune radial colour mixing system employed in the VL5 and VL2416 wash fixtures. The fixture has a single blade dimmer system, which allows for strobe effects, as well as zoom optics for a 12 to 57 degree beam angle. The VL2000 wash is a DMX only fixture. The VL2000 range of fixtures are discontinued and replaced by the VL2500 range, which feature colour mixing on spot and wash, higher torque pan and tilt motors, and an improved glass dimming system. The VL2500 range is still a current product. Many service parts are compatible between the VL6 through to VL2500. VL2416 Wash luminaire Despite its numerical designation, this was the first new luminaire to be produced following the VL7 and hence became unofficially known as the \\"VL8\\" among American crews. The VL2416 marked a major sea-change in the Vari-lite business model, in that it was the first Vari-lite luminaire that could actually be purchased. Previous luminaires had (in)famously been available for rental only. The head was closely based on that of the VL5 Arc, with radial CMY colour mixing and mechanical shutter dimming fast enough to also provide strobe effects. The liquid lens was discarded and beam width controlled instead, by a new type of zoom optics(see US Patent 6809869). This uses two plates of glass; one with a surface covered in several dozen, small (<10 mm), convex lenses and the other moulded with corresponding, concave depressions, into which the lenses precisely fit. When the plates are brought together, they effectively form a flat piece of glass, through which light passes unaffected. Moving the plates apart increases the angle of the beam, producing a very wide range of angles (5–55° in this luminaire) over a very short range of travel (<25 mm)—leading to a compact design with rapid operation (1.2 seconds end-to-end). A similar system can be seen in operation on some, early 21st-century LED stage lighting fixtures, with a variable beam angle function. As this was a self-contained luminaire, the Upper Enclosure (UPE) was restored to the design, to carry the lamp power supply and DMX related electronics. The VL2416 could only be controlled with DMX data. There was no facility for control from a proprietary Vari-lite console.

Vari-Lite designed a unit which was basically a two sided metal mirror mounted inside a Series 300 yoke. The tilt end stops were removed giving the unit the ability to spin continuously on that axis. The units were used with much success on a series of Belgium TV shows where they were used in conjunction with a series of Robert Juliat 1200w profiles. However, a limited number of units were produced and they never became a mainstream product. =VLDi= The VLDi (Vari*Lite Dimmer interface) was a 96 channel 0–10 V analogue interface between a conventional dimmer unit and the Series 200 control system. Each unit took up 100 of the 1000 available control channels, which gave the Artisan control console considerable potential. However, in many cases at the time the lighting designer on a show and the Vari*Lite operator were different people, and so many designers opted to retain the conventional lighting console. As well as this, the Artisan had been designed to control moving lights and did not provide many of the tools that conventional lighting desk operators had come to use. The final nail in the coffin for the VLDi was the mass migration of the lighting industry to the DMX512 protocol. The \\"i\\" in the VLDi acronym is still generally included in all verbal and written communications referring to the product. This is done to avoid potential confusion with the initials of Vari-lite Deutschland (VLD). =Mini ACS Rack= A single-output version of the Series 200 ACS Rack, designed mainly for test purposes. =Smart DMX= Introduced to replace the obsolete VLDi, the Vari-lite Smart DMX unit converted Series 200 data into DMX512 data, allowing control over conventional, third-party dimmers, from Vari-lite's proprietary Artisan console. This was used mainly to control dimmers which were powering the lamps of VL5, but also to control \\"conventional\\" portions of stage lighting systems, without the need (and cost) of a second console and operator. =Floyd Droid= A custom-built effects unit, designed for Pink Floyd's Delicate Sound of Thunder tour. Four were built and respectively nicknamed Manny, Moe, Jack, and Cloyd. They featured arrays of motor-driven mirrors, and (mostly) scanned multiple, tight beams of light over the audience; while avoiding potential hazards to vision, associated with producing such effects using high-power lasers. Irideon Inc. =History= Irideon, Inc. was a subsidiary company formed by Vari-lite in 1994, to target the architectural lighting market by offering colour-changing luminaires, able to dramatically illuminate buildings and outdoor structures in ways which—until then—could only be imagined. Two Irideon luminaires were initially produced: The AR500 and the AR5. Irideon Inc. was sold to Electronic Theatre Controls (ETC) in November 1998; as a result of the difficult conditions experienced by Vari-lite, during their first year of trading on the stock market. Under ETC's stewardship, the AR50 was completed and a two new luminaires—the AR6 and AR250—were created. Manuals for some Irideon luminaires are still available from ETC. =Irideon Luminaires= In chronological order: AR500 A large, metal-cased luminaire, designed for outdoor use and finished in a grey powder coat. The Pan and Tilt functions were not motorised, so the luminaire should perhaps not be considered as a true moving light. Colours were created using the same, radial DICHRO*TUNE mechanism that had been developed for the VL5. As with the VL5, there was also a set of diffuser vanes to alter the beam width. A further set of black metal vanes were used to control intensity, as the luminaire employed a 500W discharge lamp as a light source, driven by an internal lamp power supply. AR5 A much smaller luminaire, with a head approximately 300mm in length, available in a black or white finish and designed for indoor use. All functions were motorised, including Pan and Tilt, making the AR5 a true moving light. Colour, Intensity and Diffusion were handled by miniaturised versions of the mechanisms used in the AR500, using just eight vanes per set, instead of sixteen. The light source was a 35W discharge lamp, powered from an internal supply. AR6 A recessed, non-moving version of the AR5. Mounted inside a case designed to fit within the area of a standard ceiling tile and intended for use in downlight applications. AR50 A larger version of the AR5, with all functions motorised.

Plot Upset that his youthful sweetheart Darla has once again thrown him over in favor of neighborhood bully Butch, Alfalfa tries to forget his troubles by watching the free performance by Professor William Delmore, a famed hypnotist. Chosen as a subject, Alfalfa is hypnotized into believing that he is the fearless D'Artagnan, of Three Musketeers. Before Professor Delmore can remove the hypnotic suggestion, he is knocked unconscious. Armed with this bold new personality, Alfalfa not only sweeps Darla off her feet, but also challenges the dumbfounded Butch (Rochefort) to a duel. But between the time of the challenge to the actual duel, a couple of things happen which could change the entire complexity of the duel itself.

Life John Hungerford Pollen was the son of John Hungerford Pollen and Maria Margaret Pollen. The third of ten children, he was born in London in 1858. His father was professor of fine arts at the Catholic University in Dublin. Pollen junior was educated at The Oratory School in Birmingham, and then London University. Pollen entered the Society of Jesus in 1877 and was ordained in 1891.\\"Pollen, Reverend John Hungerford\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia and Its Makers, Encyclopedia Press, Incorporated, 1917, p. 139 In 1895 he was assigned the task of creating a history of the Society in England. Pollen became involved in historical research and archives. His research took him through England, France, and Italy. By 1920 he held the title of Keeper of the Archives.Allen, M., \\"The Jesuits who Shaped the Province Archives\\", Jesuits in Britain, June 20, 2016 He was one of the group of Jesuit historians restoring the reputation of Robert Persons.Victor Houliston, Catholic Resistance in Elizabethan England: Robert Persons's Jesuit Polemic, 1580-1610 (2007), p. 19. He was influential in the history of the term Counter-Reformation, accepting for the Catholic side the appellation for the period of Catholic reform centred on the Council of Trent, but at the same time offering an interpretation that made it less reactive, in relation to the Protestant Reformation. These ideas were put forth in the 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia article he wrote on the subject.John W. O'Malley, The Historiography of the Society of Jesus, p. 20, in John W. O'Malley, Gauvin Alexander Bailey, Steve J. Harris, T. Frank Kennedy, The Jesuits: Cultures, Sciences, and the Arts, 1540-1773 (1999). Pollen was also a contributor to The Month, and the Dublin Review. Pollen was vice-postulator for the beatification of the English Martyrs. He was a correspondent of Georg Cantor, from 1896Christian Tapp, Kardinalität und Kardinäle: Wissenschaftshistorische Aufarbeitung der Korrespondenz zwischen Georg Cantor und katholischen Theologen seiner Zeit (2005), p. 478. and a founding member with Joseph Stanislaus Hansom of the Catholic Record Society in 1904.
