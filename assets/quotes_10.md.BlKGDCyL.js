Developed in 1994 by Rudolf Bosshard in Switzerland, it is a modification of the Almen strip method, which is used worldwide as a surface treatment testing methodDavid Kirk \\"Peening Intensity Curves\\" . (pdf) Summer 2007 in the field of shot peening. The basic principle is the same, but due to the simple shape and minimized size, the Almen round is more suitable for automated processing and installation on dummy rigs. Also instead of the Almen block according SAE J442, here a matching device is used and if connected to electronic processing unit, the Almen value\\"Shot Peening Intensity\\" Retrieved 23 January 2013 according AMS-S-13165 (predecessor MIL-S-13165 Rev.C) can be evaluated in one run.  Test specimen  Dimension of an Almen round The Almen round is a circular cutting from an original Almen strip normally in material SAE 1070. It can be either of a \\"A\\", \\"C\\" or \\"N\\" type offered in various quality grades. The standard strip allows the splitting into four pieces rounds, which have a diameter of 18.7 mm, by either waterjet or laser technique. Therefore, the spaces are maintained in respect of material and thickness. The flatness test to follow is simple and imprecise pieces can be eliminated.  Specimen holder  Clamping of the Almen round specimen showing online monitoring configuration In the endeavor to standardize the parameters, the clamping down of the Almen rounds follows a strict geometry. The clamping head fixes the Almen round in correct manner, thus important for all related procedure. When working with the monitoring sensor, the specimen is preloaded to increase overall accuracy.  Measuring technique  Cross-section through online monitoring sensor Other than the Almen strip method with the two steps: 1. Processing with holder\\"Almen Strip Holders\\" . (pdf) Retrieved 23 January 2013 and 2. Measuring with gage,\\"TSP-3 Almen Gage\\" . (pdf) Retrieved 23 January 2013 the Almen round technique combines those activities. The specimen holder is complemented with a measuring system, e.g. a distance sensor system of various kinds to complete the monitoring sensor. While bombarded by shot, the captured Almen round gets bent towards the direction of the attack. The linear transformation gets converted into an electric signal sent to a processing unit. With calibration discs, errors will be minimalized. For the offline measuring of an individual round, the online monitoring sensor or an appropriate device will also be used.  Signal processing  Thus the equipment is designed for direct exposure to the shot stream, the deformation of the round can be monitored online and directly converted into the Almen standard arc high definition (SAE J443) either in mm or inches. Such a process time will be in the range of less than 5 to 40 seconds. If on screen, the graph\\"Almen-Round demo\\" Retrieved 23 January 2013 shows the basis for the calculation algorithm, also the essential point in mm or inches that is the output information equivalent to the original Almen round definition.

Therefore the Almen round is captured in a special mount that can be screwed or glued onto the dummy or even on a real part. In such a case an online monitoring is not possible, the specimens must get removed and then measured separately with the monitoring sensor. In this case, only the arc height can be traced. So this application should be in combination with a parallel running online process.  Field of application  The Almen round can be utilized in aircraft and automotive industry, research and subcontracting peening enterprises.  Application restriction  As the Almen strip principle has been established in 1942 and international standardization has reached a top-level. The strip work routine is a fixed procedure in practical peening technology. The Almen round principle is more accurate and offers a considerable working time reduction. But as there is no international approved standardization, this technique will be used for special applications only.

He served with distinction in two World Wars and was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire.Who's Who in Australia (The Herald and Weekly Times Limited, 1950) pp 309 Birth and education Carruthers was born at Maitland, New South Wales, the son of Rev James Edward Carruthers and nephew of Sir Joseph Carruthers, 16th Premier of New South Wales. He went up to the University of Sydney in 1909 and graduated MB in 1915. War service =World War I= Carruthers served with the Royal Army Medical Corps in England, France, Salonika and India from 1914 until 1919 and held the rank of major. After active service he undertook a post-graduate course in medicine in London, becoming a Member and later a Fellow of the Royal Sanitary Institute. =World War II= In 1940, he rejoined the Australian Army Medical Corps. He served until 1945 and attained the rank of lieutenant colonel and was assistant director of hygiene in the First Australian Army. Carruthers was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the military division for distinguished service in the Middle East. Medical career =New South Wales= Following World War I, Carruthers became a resident medical officer at the Coast Hospital. Until 1927 he worked mainly in mental diseases and undertook post-graduate studies in psychiatry at the University of Sydney. He worked at Callan Park and was in charge of five Red Cross nerve hospitals in Sydney tending ex-servicemen. He was also associated with Randwick Repatriation Hospital and worked in private practice. =Tasmania= From 1927 until 1935 Carruthers was the senior house surgeon at the Royal Hobart Hospital and then for a year he was administrator of the Lachlan Park Hospital. He was appointed the Tasmanian Director of Public Health in 1936 and served in that capacity until rejoining the army in World War II. At war's end Carruthers was appointed Director of Hospitals and Medical Services in Tasmania.

Historical context During the 1940s and 1950s in different parts of Canada, the federal, provincial and municipal governments were working together to take communities labelled \\"slums\\" and relocate the people to better housing. The intent was to use the land for business and industry. Many years earlier, and again in 1947, after a major fire burnt several Africville houses, the topic of relocation of Africville was discussed. Concrete plans of relocation, stimulated by the 1957 Stephenson Report, did not officially emerge until 1961 with the creation of the City's Department of Development. In 1962, Halifax adopted the relocation proposal unanimously. Promising free lawyers and social workers, as well as such things as job training, employment assistance, education services to those affected, the Rose Report (publ. 1964) was passed 37/41 in favour of relocation.Walker, James W. St. G. 1997. \\"Allegories and Orientations in African-Canadian Historiography: The Spirit of Africville.\\" Dalhousie Review 77(2):155‚Äì80. p. 160. The report never went into details or analyzed what the lives of residents would be like in their new homes, but was insistent that their best interests were at heart. = Relocation = The relocation took place mainly between 1964 and 1967. The residents were assisted in their move by the City's authorities, moving the Africvillians with city dump trucks. This image forever stuck in the minds and hearts of people and indicated the degrading style in which these people were treated. There were many hardships, suspicion and jealousy that emerged, mostly due to complications of land and ownership claims. Only 14 residents held clear legal titles to their land. Those with no legal rights were given a $500 payment and promised a furniture allowance, social assistance, and public housing units.Clairmont, Donald, and Dennis William Mcgill. 1974. Africville: The Life and Death of a Canadian Black Community. Toronto: McClelland & Stewart. p. 67. Young families would make enough money to begin a new life, but most of the elderly residents would not budge as they had much more of an emotional connection to their homes. Though filled with grief and feeling cheated out of their property, resistance to eviction became harder as more people accepted and homes disappeared. = Demolition = The city quickly demolished each house as soon as residents moved out. The church at Africville was demolished in 1969 at night to avoid controversy. The last Africville home was demolished on 2 January 1970. Part of Africville is now occupied by a highway interchange that services the A. Murray MacKay Bridge; however, the port development at Fairview Cove did not extend as far east as Africville, leaving the waterfront intact. Developing redress The founding families of Africville listed on the Africville Monument at Seaview Memorial Park Efforts to address the plight of the Africville relocation happened over 25 years. These efforts were largely led by the Africville Genealogy Society. In light of the controversy surrounding the community, the City of Halifax created Seaview Memorial Park on the site in the 1980s, preserving it from development. Former Africville residents such as Eddie Carvery carried out periodic protests at the park throughout the 1980s and 1990s.Tattrie, John. 2010. The Hermit of Africville. Halifax: Pottersfield Press. In 1989, a historic exhibit about Africville toured across Canada and evolved into a permanent exhibit on display at Nova Scotia's Black Cultural Centre in Preston. In 2001, a United Nations report called for reparations to be paid to the community of Africville. =Music= Numerous musicians have commemorated the story of Africville, in part, to pressure governments to provide redress. * African-Canadian singer-songwriter Faith Nolan released an album in 1986 called Africville. * In 1996, Montreal-born jazz pianist Joe Sealy released a CD of original music, Africville Suite, which won a Juno Award in 1997. It includes twelve pieces reflecting on places and activities in Africville, where Sealy's father was born. Sealy worked and lived in Halifax during the time of these events, and began the suite in memory of his father. * In 1997, Canadian jazz pianist Trevor Mackenzie released the album Ain't No Thing Like a Chicken Wing as a tribute to the neighbourhood where his father grew up. * In 2007, Newfoundland metal/hardcore band Bucket Truck released a video for their song \\"A Nourishment by Neglect\\", which details the events surrounding Africville. * Also in 2007, Canadian hip hop group Black Union released a song, featuring Maestro, about the historic community of Africville. The music video was recorded in Seaview Park. =Film and literature= There are various film and theatre productions made to commemorate the plight of Africville. * Remember Africville (1991), a documentary film released by the National Film Board of Canada, received the Moonsnail Award for best documentary at the Atlantic Film Festival. * Consecrated Ground (1998), a play by George Boyd and produced by Eastern Front Theatre produced, fictitiously chronicled the Africville eviction. * The story of Africville is a significant influence on the work of writer George Elliott Clarke. * Last Days in Africville (2006, Dundum Press), by Dorothy Perkyns, is a fictional account of life for a young Africville girl at the time of its destruction. * Stolen From Africville (2008) is an independently-produced documentary that follows the lives of those displaced from the Africville community over the course of a year. The film, which Heritage Canada began funding in 2007, was written and directed by Canadian activist and performer Neil Donaldson and Sourav Deb. =Political action= In May 2005, MLA Maureen MacDonald (Nova Scotia NDP) introduced a bill in the provincial legislature called the Africville Act. The bill calls for a formal apology from the Nova Scotia Government; a series of public hearings on the destruction of Africville; and the establishment of a development fund towards the historical preservation of Africville lands and towards social development in benefit of former residents and their descendants. Halifax mayor Peter Kelly has offered land, money, and various other services for a replica of the Seaview African United Baptist Church. After the offer was originally made in 2002, the Africville Genealogy Society requested some alterations to the Halifax offer, including additional land and the possibility of building affordable housing near the site. The Africville site was declared a national historic site in 2002. Apology In February 2010, Halifax Council ratified the Africville Apology, and the Government of Canada announced $250,000 for the Africville Heritage Trust to design a museum and build a replica of the community church. On 24 February, Halifax Mayor Peter Kelly made the Africville Apology as part of a $4.5-million compensation deal, officially apologizing for the eviction. Among other things, Kelly said, On 29 July 2011, the city restored the name Africville to Seaview Park at the annual Africville Family Reunion. The Seaview African United Baptist Church, demolished in 1969, was rebuilt in the summer of 2011 to serve as a church and interpretation centre. The church was ceremonially opened on 25 September.\\"Africville replica church celebrated.\\" CBC News. 25 September 2011. .Arsenault, Dan. 26 September 2011. \\"Tears and memories mark Africville church opening.\\" Halifax Chronicle Herald. Rev. Rhonda Britten, a leader in the African-Nova-Scotian community, welcomed the settlement and said it was time to put the past behind them: > I know that there are some among us who are wounded, and some among us who > bear those scars. But, in spite of all of that, the victory has been won. We > cannot continue to feed our children the bitter pills, we must give them the > pills of love. We must plant in them the seeds of unity and victory. That is > the only way.

Dedicated to Shiva, it is located at Jadhua Road, Hajipur. As per local folklore, it is said to have been in existence since ancient period and Lord Shiva is believed to be in the form of Lingam here. Apart from anthropomorphic images of Shiva, the worship of Shiva in the form of a lingam, or linga, is also important. The worship of the Shiva-Linga originated from the famous hymn in the Atharva-Veda Samhit√¢ sung in praise of the Yupa-Stambha, the sacrificial post.

Alternate common names/spellings include 'Herath', 'Hararatri', 'Shivaratri, Sivarathri, and Shivaratri. Shivaratri literally means the great night of Shiva or the night of Shiva. It is celebrated every year on the 13th night/14th day of the Maagha or Phalguna month of the Hindu calendar. Since many different calendars are followed by various ethno-linguistic groups of India, the month and the Tithi name are not uniform all over India. Celebrated in the dark fortnight or Krishna Paksha(waning moon) of the month of Maagha according to the Shalivahana or Gujarati Vikrama or Phalguna according to the Vikrama era.

The estate was purchased in 2003 by conservationist and philanthropist Paul Lister, who hopes to recreate a wooded landscape and reintroduce native animals including predators such as Scottish wildcat and the wolf. It is now being managed as a privately owned nature reserve that aims to promote biodiversity and associated tourism at the forefront of its mission. The idea of a wilderness reserve was inspired by Lister's visits to South Africa's ever popular game reserves, and to create an area of outstanding natural beauty, where a pack of European wolves could be released into a controlled reserve. This has been proven in South Africa, when over-grazed farmland has been returned to a more natural state. As with all land in Scotland, there is a right of responsible access to the reserve for pursuits such as walking, cycling, horse-riding and wild camping, and the estate is an access route to C√†rn Ban (845m). Ramblers and hillwalkers are concerned that the estate's plans may prevent access to grounds within the reserve. Enclosure would contravene principles of open access enshrined in the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 unless stiles and gates were provided. Whilst the Ramblers support reintroductions, they see charging for access to fenced enclosures as a way for owners of large estates to subvert the Act. Flora and fauna Glen Mor The Alladale estate covers a variety of habitats, including glacial mountains, forests, rivers, and lochs. Between 2009 and 2012, 800,000 native trees (Scots pine, birch, rowan, willow, alder, aspen, holly, hazel, oak, and juniper) have been planted in protected enclosures. Wild animals found living on the estate include red deer, roe deer, otter, red fox, mountain hare, badger, pine marten, red squirrel, pipistrelle, and Britain's most threatened mammal, the water vole. Salmon and brown trout are found in the rivers and lochs. The moors are clad in ling and bell heather and the reserve is home to three species of grouse: black grouse, red grouse and ptarmigan. Raptors and corvids include golden eagle, white-tailed eagle, osprey, buzzard, peregrine falcon, merlin, kestrel and raven. A fold of Highland Cattle lives on the reserve as part of Alladale's conservation grazing project. Rewilding proposals European Grey Wolf Britain was once a largely forested landscape. It would have been home to the now extinct large carnivores wolves, bears, and lynx.https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/history_of_the_earth/Holocene But humans began to deforest the countryside, to make way for crops and livestock. Almost all the large mammals had been forced into extinction by various means. Wolves were the last to disappear in the early 1700s from Scotland. Britain 7,000 years ago probably would have looked more like the untamed wilderness still found today in parts of Romania, than the criss-cross of farmland seen today. The Scottish Highlands provide the best opportunity for rewilding at scale in Britain. Wolves would regulate deer numbers on the reserve and mitigate the browsing of young trees and encourage regeneration. This (in theory) should be a more effective way of managing deer numbers. The main benefit of the wolf project is biodiversity improvement and a more balanced ecosystem and a subsequent increase in tourism related revenues in local communities (see Yellowstone National Park), with annual visitors numbers anticipated to reach up to 20,000 per annum. Management Red Deer stags at Alladale Alladale is a member of the travel industry certification protocol It Must Be Now. Following the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, this protocol uses the Earthcheck programme to benchmark all Alladale's business, operational, and rewilding efforts. The European Nature Trust (TENT), a partner of Alladale Wilderness Reserve, is a charitable organisation which focuses on the protection of threatened wilderness areas in Europe. TENT considers that forest restoration is important \\"for many reasons, including supporting some of the UK‚Äôs rarest species, improving carbon sequestration, enrich the biodiversity of the rivers, improving spawning and feeding grounds for native fish and flood mitigation.\\" TENT projects on the reserve involve the translocation of Red Squirrel, a Scottish wildcat breeding programme in partnership with the Royal Zoological Society Scotland, and funding of the Highland Outdoor Wilderness Learning programme for local teenagers since 2008. It was decided in early 2018 to stop all commercial deer stalking activities at Alladale, allowing the team of rangers to take full control of the deer cull. Deer numbers as per the start of 2020 are around 5 to 6 deer per square kilometer. 2020 will see the completion of an aquaponics vegetable garden at Alladale. Commercial activities Alladale Lodge Guests are able to book Alladale Lodge with its seven double en-suite rooms and private chef. There also are two cottages on the reserve offering accommodation to 4 and 8 guests respectively. Further into the reserve, one of Scotland's most remote buildings Deanich Lodge is available for groups up to 16. Various activities are available including guided hiking, clay pigeon shooting, angling, mountain biking, whisky tasting and safaris using off-road vehicles. Throughout the year, Alladale is home to a wide range of retreats offering yoga, mindfulness, culinary events, and nature based transformative experiences. In winter, guests can challenge themselves to experience the Wim Hof Method. The British adventurer and television presenter Bear Grylls has set up the Bear Grylls Survival Academy here. Participants learn such skills as self-sufficiency, trapping wild animals, fire lighting, building emergency shelters and unarmed combat.

Biography Ronald Fleming was born in Scotland, the son of a doctor from Kelso. He attended Epsom College and then, in the 1920s, studied interior design at the New York School in Paris. Between his study in England and France, he served during World War I with the Cold Stream Guards. In 1931 he worked in Paris with Keeble Ltd (Keeble Ltd had its office in London at Carlisle House). He worked also for Kelso Ltd and Arundell Clarke. In 1932 he opened, and managed, the decoration department at Fortnum & Mason. In 1949 he became the director of Mann and Fleming Ltd. In 1931 he published Talk on Decoration. In 1932 he organized the exhibition \\"Modern Designs for Mural Decoration\\" at Carlisle House, opened by Osbert Sitwell and including works, among others, by Roger Fry, Duncan Grant and Edward Halliday. He also gave lectures on ethos and technique. Fleming was friends with Roy De Maistre and in 1953 he bought Flower Piece, which passed to Adrian Brookholding-Jones, grand-son of the sculptor Adrian Jones, and then sold at Brookholding-Jones' death. His commissions included: the ballroom in the Royal Palace in Athens for King George II of Greece; the Penthouse Suite at the Dorchester Hotel, together with Oliver Messel; the interiors of Dalmeny House for Harry Primrose, 6th Earl of Rosebery; stage sets and murals. In magazines of the time, he was often introduced as a bachelor interior designer, a subtle way to say that he was gay. The same applied to Oliver Frederick Ford, Carl Toms and Alan Tagg. Fleming lived all his adult life, until death, with Geoffrey Houghton-Brown (1903-1993), an authority on 18th-century French furniture.

Established as Southampton's first museum in 1912, the house was closed for nine years between 2002 and 2011 during an extensive renovation. The house is located in Bugle Street, opposite St. Michael's Square, in Southampton's Old Town.  History  = 1180‚Äì15th century = Southampton's Medieval Walls, fortified after 1336 The earliest part of the site is a Norman domestic dwelling, built in the 1180s. Although the site is known as King John's Palace there is no evidence that King John of England ever visited the house. In the 14th century the merchant and mayor of Southampton, John Whytegod, lived in the property. After the French raid of Southampton in 1338 the walls were turned into what would become Southampton's defensive walls. Its windows and doors were filled in or replaced with gun slits. It is one of the finest examples of Norman domestic architecture in England. = 15th century‚Äì1550 = The main body of the house was extended and developed by Sir John Dawtrey (d.1518), a major landowner, M.P. and Sheriff. He received large sums of money from Henry VIII to supply food for the navy and to help in the defences of the town. Money was also provided for the building, fitting out and provisioning of ships ‚Äì including The Mary Rose. During the Tudor period, the house was a home for influential members of Southampton society including Sir Richard Lyster (1480‚Äì1554), a judge and Chief Justice of the King's Bench. = 1550‚Äì1700 = In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the house was used as a merchant house as a cloth maker and manufacturer. During the restoration, in 2007, conservators discovered that several walls were covered with graffiti that dated between 1570 and 1620. Images include ships, caricatures of people, and exotic animals. During that period Tudor House was owned by ship owners, and it is likely that the house was used as a place of lodging for sailors and privateers. The graffiti is now considered to be one of the most well- preserved pieces of Tudor maritime graffiti in England. = 18th century = During the 18th century, Tudor House was owned by the artist George Rogers, who made significant alterations to the house, including building a Georgian wing, complete with two large sash windows. By this time, the oak beam fa√ßade at the front of the property had been plastered and repainted. The house's improvements in fortune coincided with those of Southampton, which had become fashionable as a spa town, due to the discovery of a chalybeate spring. = 19th century = For a large proportion of the century the house was divided into lease-held properties. The house also had a number of business uses, including a dyeworks, bookbinders, bonnet-makers and architect's office. By the end of the 19th century the area around Tudor House had become one of the city's worst slum areas, with limited running water, disease-ridden properties, and malnourished tenants. Because of this the area, including Tudor House, was scheduled for demolition. = 20th century = In 1886, when the house was threatened with demolition, local philanthropist William Spranger bought the house, recognising its significance as a site of historic importance. Spranger made significant changes to the house, including installing a 'minstrels' gallery in above the banqueting hall, and creating several doors where previously there had been none. For twelve years he led a campaign to turn the house into a museum. Eventually he was successful, and the house opened as a museum on 31 July 1912. During the Second World War Tudor House and Garden remained open as a museum, and the wine cellar was used as an air raid shelter by the museum curator, Edward Judd, and his family during the Southampton Blitz in 1940. Tudor House remained undamaged, however a house two doors away was destroyed. In the 1970s an early 19th century cannon that had been found during the construction of the Itchen bridge was placed in the house garden. By the end of the century, the museum had become fairly dilapidated; a combination of poor renovation work, and time. According to a survey conducted in 1999, the house was 'opening like the petals of a flower', a reference to the way the house was bowing outwards. In 1999, a survey of the building discovered major structural problems, and major redevelopment work was needed to preserve the building. Funds were sought from Southampton City Council, the Heritage Lottery Fund, English Heritage, and other donors. = 21st century = External architectural detail As seen from Bugle Street The museum closed to the public in 2002, and remained closed for nine years. During this time walls were strengthened, new interpretation was added, and archaeological fieldwork was conducted. Additionally a new block was added, consisting of a cafe and toilet facilities. These were designed to remain in keeping with the original building. In 2012, the centenary was marked by opening with an admission price of 6 pence, the same price as when the museum first opened.  Garden  Tudor House's Garden The garden was initially developed in the 16th century, and was seen as an extension of the house itself. The current garden is a recreation of a Tudor knot garden, and was designed by garden historian Dr Sylvia Landsberg. The plants in the garden are representative of the types of plants that would have been found during the Tudor period, particularly herbs and edible plants. The garden is based on manuscripts and other historic sources. Features of the garden include parapets and mounts, a fountain plot, a seat arbour, and bee bole.

The fansite eyeofhorus.org, declared: > \\"Whether it‚Äôs atmospheric treatment to voices...the gulp of a soldier > rehydrating himself...the lethal laser rifle blast...to the gentle womb-like > hum of the TARDIS console room...Meonsound has once again excelled in > recreating the seemingly impossible\\". BBC Television's Doctor Who director Barry Letts (1925 - 2009) commented on Power's contribution to 'Doctor Who & The Daemons' noting that \\"The music & FX work well because they are so precise in their dubbing.\\" Titles that include Simon Power's sound enhancement have been released regularly since 2004 under BBC Audiobooks & more recently as BBC Audio's AudioGo imprint.

The taeogion were distinguished both from the nobility (boneddigion) above them and the foreign-born (alltudion) and slaves (caethion) below.

The class of all taeogion were divided between the serfs of the king's land and those of the nobles', with the wergild of the former valued at twice that of the latter. Those of the king were administered by the mayor. Both groups were restricted to land holdings in special settlements set aside for them, the taeogtrev (lit. \\"serf town\\").

It is located approximately to the northwest of the Standing Stones of Yoxie, and about southeast of the Pettigarths Field Cairns. Benie Hoose and Yoxie demonstrate characteristics of 'paired houses'. It was excavated in 1954‚Äì1955 by Charles S. T. Calder who gave the items to the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland in 1955‚Äì1956. Furthermore, its close proximity to Yoxie indicates that Druid priests probably lived in the house and performed ceremonies at the stones. OS (NKB) visited the site on 30 May 1968. The one-room site measures , and features a horned forecourt. Layout The Benie Hoose is laid out in the form of a figure of eight, to the southeast of Pettigarths Field, about 30m from the lower hill slopes of Gamla Vord. The front elevation is curved and with a courtyard in horn shape. It has no similarity with other dwelling units (70 units seen here) but has identity with the Yoxie monument. The main block is of length and width while the forecourt is wide. The main block is set towards the hill. The walls are made of dry stones of thickness. The large number of tools and querns found here attests to the domestic nature of the Benie Hoose. There is a passage leading from the entrance. The complex has an elaborate drainage system which ensured that the interior remained dry. The floor of the chamber had stone flooring. The forecourt is D shaped and is conjectured as an animal pen. No stone made furniture was found which has led to the conclusion that the furniture must have been made of wood. Artifacts Calder unearthed an unusual quantity of tools and querns, indicating that there was a dwelling here, possibly a vicary, as 'Benie' is believed to be a local term for 'Bone House' or graveyard or a transliteration of the Old Norse 'Boenhus', which means 'a house of prayer' or chapel. Artifacts include 33 trough querns, and 1,800 implements such as axes, hammer stones, hammer pounders, picks, pot lids, pot shards, steatite pot handle, and a steatite spindle whorl. Based on architectural details and its location with respect to Yoxie, a nearby site, it is conjectured that the Benie Hoose was the residence of the priests who were associated with performing worship at the temple at Yoxie. =Cairns= Earlier archaeological explorations carried out at about north west of Benie House during 1936 and 1938 have revealed two Pettigarths Field Cairns; the first one is on the south of the site which is square in shape measuring with a circular entry of , the other carn is a smaller circular one of diameter with cist in the shape of a rectangle.

Bosworth, The New Islamic Dynasties, (Columbia University Press, 1996), 162; \\"Hence in 758 the caliph undertook the definitive conquest of Tabaristan, successfully drove out Khurshid II and ended the dynasty of the Dabuyids(who, as Zoroastrians, had never accepted Islam..\\". Iranian dynasty that started in the early seventh century as an independent group of rulers, reigning over Tabaristan and parts of western Khorasan.DABUYIDS, W. Madelung, Encyclopaedia Iranica Dabuyid rule over Tabaristan and Khorasan lasted from ca. AD 642 to the Abbasid conquest in 760.  History  The family's early history is recorded by the later historian Ibn Isfandiyar. According to this tradition, the Dabuyids were descended from Jamasp, a brother of the Sassanid King of Kings Kavadh I, and were therefore a cadet branch of the House of Sassan. Jamasp's grandson, Piruz, conquered Gilan, and a progeny of Piruz's, Gil, nicknamed Gavbara (literally Devotee of the Cow), then extended the family's rule by annexing Tabaristan. This led to the formal conferment of the titles of Gil e Gilan (\\"ruler of Gilan\\") and Padashwargarshah (\\"King of Patashwargar\\", the older name of Tabaristan's mountains), to Gil's son Dabuya or Daboe, by the last Sassanid King of Kings, Yazdegerd III. Following the Muslim conquest of Persia, this Sassanian cadet branch, along with the dynasts of the noble houses of Ispahbudan and Karin, signed peace treaties with the Arab armies by which the Arabs were obligated to never approach these territories without prior permission. Consequently the regions of Gilan and at least parts of Tabaristan remained under Gavbara's control, while Rey and parts of Khorasan were ruled by Farrokhzad of House of Ispahbudan.Pourshariati, Parvaneh (2008). Decline and Fall of the Sasanian Empire: The Sasanian-Parthian Confederacy and the Arab Conquest of Iran. London and New York: I.B. Tauris. pp 287-318. . After about 15 years, Ibn Isfandiyar reports that Gavbara died and his son Dabuya succeeded the throne - hence the name given to the dynasty. Dabuya's son, Farrukhan the Great was successful in taking over Tabaristan up to the frontiers of Nishapur after years of dynastic struggle between the houses of Karin and Ispahbudan in north eastern Iran. In addition to the titles granted by Yazdegerd III, the Dabuyid rulers also bore the old Iranian military title of ispahbadh as their regnal title. Farrukhan the Great, repelled a great Muslim invasion under Yazid ibn al-Muhallab in 716‚Äì717,\\"Dabuya\\", B. Spuler, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. II, ed.B. Lewis, C. Pellat and J. Schacht, (Brill, 1991), 74. Recent scholarship places his assumption of power there in the 670s instead of the early 710s, as previously assumed. Farrokhan died in 728, and was succeeded by his son, Dadhburzmihr (Dadmihr). Little is known of his reign, and he died at an early age in 740/741. Dadmihr's son and successor, Khurshid, was still a boy when he was crowned Ispahbadh of Tabaristan, requiring his uncle Farrukhan the Little to rule as regent for seven years until Khurshid came of age. Khurshid ruled a prosperous state and tried repeatedly, though without success, to break his ties to the Caliphate. Following the turmoil of the Abbasid Revolution, a serious conflict ensued between Khurshid and the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mansur. In 759, Mansur used a ruse to launch a campaign against the Dabuyid dynasty. He sought Khurshid's aid in subduing a rebellion in Khorasan by allowing the Caliph's forces to pass through Tabaristan. Khushid permitted this only to be faced with a surprise attack which led to the invasion and subsequent fall of Tabaristan. The fleeing Khurshid took refuge in Gilan, where he attempted to reinforce for a counter attack but following the capture of the royal family committed suicide in 761, thus ending the reign of the Dabuyid dynasty.

The Appellate Division answered thus: #Yes, prohibited, until the Defendant complies with the provisions of the Act. #Yes, in respect of this Defendant. #Yes, until the Defendant complies with the provisions of the Act, and the Regulations made thereunder. Winner appealed. =At the Supreme Court of Canada= Appeal was allowed. In an 8-1 decision the Court held that Winner was entitled to pick up and drop off passengers that were on an international or interprovincial journey, but not with regard to journeys between points within the province. For his part, Rinfret CJ answered that the New Brunswick Act and Regulation did not prohibit Winner's operations, and the conditions that the Board had attached to its permit were ultra vires. ;The nature of Canadian citizenship In his opinion, Rand J. observed that citizens were free to move across provincial borders and live wherever they chose to, and only the federal government could limit this right: ;Appeal and cross-appeal The Attorney General of Ontario sought leave to appeal the part of the decision that allowed the picking up and dropping of passengers in the province, whether the journey began or ended inside or outside the province. Winner cross-appealed against the prohibition of purely intraprovincial traffic. At the Privy Council The appeal was dismissed, and the cross-appeal was allowed. In his opinion, Lord Porter held that this case fell within the same scope as that of the Radio Reference in determining the nature of works and undertakings and under which jurisdiction they fall. As Winner was carrying on an undertaking connecting New Brunswick with both Nova Scotia and Maine, there exists an undertaking connecting province with province and beyond the limits of the province. Therefore, it was an undertaking that fell within federal jurisdiction, and it was one and indivisible. It was also argued that the province could regulate who could use its roads. While the Board agreed that such jurisdiction did exist, it was limited and could not interfere with connecting undertakings. As Lord Porter declared: Impact Winner effectively placed all commercial interprovincial and international motor vehicle traffic under federal jurisdiction. Rand J's comments relating to mobility rights of Canadians, while obiter in this case, have significantly affected Canadian jurisprudence.

Guard boats patrolled Halifax harbour day and night and they boarded all incoming and outgoing vessels.Mercer, p. 221 The Navy always struggled with desertion in Nova Scotia, and it often threatened to use impressment as a punishment for communities that harboured and assisted deserters.Mercer, p. 215 The Navy used guard boats as floating press gangs, conscripting every fiftieth man out of ships entering the harbour. It even pressed Americans from cartels and prison hulks. Warships shot at vessels to bring them to, damaging their sails and rigging, and at least one fisherman was pressed while checking his nets. British warships sent armed press gangs into Halifax, where they fought with townspeople. The incidents were frequently violent and people were killed. The press gangs would drive all before them in the streets. The press gangs would bind recruits' hands behind their backs and march them through the street like criminals. Impressment caused socioeconomic problems in Nova Scotia. For sailors, it was often a violent and life-altering experience. They potentially faced years in the service, forced separation from their families and friends, and death through disease and combat. Civil and personal liberties were suspended for the good of the British war effort.Mercer, p. 230 Generally, impressment victims were young men from poor and middle-class backgrounds. Often impacting sailors and fishermen, they supported family members and widowed mothers, and were often married with young children. Dozens of families in Liverpool alone were torn apart by impressment during the Napoleonic Wars.Mercer, p. 231  American Revolution  Planters and other Nova Scotians were exempted from naval service during the 1760s, but impressment became a serious threat during the American Revolution.Mercer, p. 208 The American conflict severed the Royal Navy from its traditional labour market in North America, which pressured loyalist colonies such as Nova Scotia and Newfoundland to make up for the shortage of manpower.Mercer, p. 215 By August 1775, the Nova Scotia government received a petition from Halifax merchants complaining about impressment. The issue came to a head in October when the Assembly petitioned Governor Francis Legge to put a stop to impressment in Nova Scotia. By 1776 the Navy used guard boats as floating press gangs, conscripting every fiftieth man from ships entering the harbour. It even pressed Americans from cartels and prison hulks. Still in need of men, warships sent armed press gangs into Halifax, where they fought with townspeople.Mercer, p. 221 In 1778, Lieutenant-Governor Richard Hughes lashed out at the Navy for press gang incidents that were frequently marked by quarrels, bloodshed and the loss of life. Hughes complained that press gangs caused social unrest in Halifax and he banned them from shore unless they had colonial permission. The press gangs would drive all before them in the streets. The Halifax grand jury condemned the Navy for its disrespect of provincial and municipal authority, and also for binding recruits‚Äô hands behind their backs and marching them through the street like criminals. The Royal Navy pressed approximately 200 Liverpool residents in the 18th and 19th centuries.Mercer, p. 207 Liverpool experienced more of these naval intrusions than other regional ports in British North America.Mercer, p. 209 At least two dozen of Liverpool's pressed sailors died in the British fleet or were never heard from again. For the Planters who settled in Liverpool in the 1760s, they were largely protected from press gangs based on age, social status, and colonial exemptions, but their sons and descendants had a much tougher time with the Navy. Impressment took a serious toll on Liverpool. Outside of Halifax, during the American Revolution the Navy concentrated its recruitment efforts on coastal shipping and small ports such as Liverpool.Mercer, p. 218 In one instance, HM sloop Senegal was in Liverpool for about four months and impressment loomed as a threat the entire time. It pressed three men there and in the neighbouring villages of Port Medway, Port Mouton, and Brooklyn. Another ship, HMS Blonde, during the late 1770s, cruised extensively in the St. Lawrence River and coastal Nova Scotia, entering dozens of recruits at Halifax and from ships and towns along the South Shore.Mercer, p. 219 Impressment damaged Nova Scotia trade, but the Navy's inability to stop Yankee privateers was a much larger concern. Privateers captured hundreds of vessels and made bold amphibious assaults on Liverpool in 1780 and Lunenburg in 1782.Mercer, p. 220 Although Halifax led the way, Liverpool sent out five privateers during the war, including Lucy, a schooner of 18 guns and 50 men. There was intense competition for sailors from trading vessels and the Navy. As a merchant, Simeon Perkins attempted to protect the citizens of Liverpool from the press gangs. He issued papers saying that sailors were master, mates and apprentices, or under the age of 18, all of whom were exempted from impressment. Fraudulent protections were common.Mercer, pp. 224‚Äì25 In 1800, however, Liverpool privateers had a large portion of their crews pressed.Mercer, p. 227 80 men were pressed over the year. The privateer Duke of Kents encounter with HMS Nereide was the deadliest for Liverpool: of the 20 pressed sailors, nine returned home at various times, eight died, and three were never heard from again.Mercer, p. 228  Napoleonic Wars  Governor Wentworth and his council issued at least 13 warrants between 1793 and 1805.Mercer, p. 222 Only sailors could be taken into service. The Navy used guard boats to press at sea, over which Nova Scotia had no jurisdiction. Wentworth did succeed in protecting many groups from impressment: freeholders, militiamen, market boat crews and even the Dartmouth ferry operator. This exempted most Nova Scotians from impressment during the Napoleonic period, but it also prevented the Navy from keeping its ships manned and ready for duty. The first press warrant granted in Nova Scotia was in April 1793, when Wentworth granted a warrant to Commander Rupert George of HMS Hussar. George sent press gangs from Hussar into Halifax. In one night they detained 50 to 60 men, including several Liverpool mariners, and brought them aboard Hussar. Liverpool sailors also stood in constant fear of press gangs and guard boats at Halifax and often refused to sail there based on rumours of impressment.Mercer, p. 232 Vice-Admiral George Berkely declared in 1806, unless he sent these small warships to maritime communities and regional shipping lanes to press sailors, there was no hope of manning the North American squadron. = Halifax Impressment Riot = Vice Admiral Andrew Mitchell, who ordered the press gang of ashore to Halifax The Navy's manning problems in Nova Scotia peaked in 1805. Warships were short-handed from high desertion rates, and naval captains were handicapped in filling those vacancies by provincial impressment regulations. Desperate for sailors, the Navy pressed them all over the North Atlantic region in 1805, from Halifax and Charlottetown to Saint John and Quebec City. In early May, Vice Admiral Andrew Mitchell sent press gangs from several warships into downtown Halifax. They conscripted men first and asked questions later, rounding up dozens of potential recruits. The breaking point came in October 1805, when Vice-Admiral Mitchell allowed press gangs from to storm the streets of Halifax armed with bayonets, sparking a major riot in which one man was killed and several others were injured. Wentworth lashed out at the admiral for sparking urban unrest and breaking provincial impressment laws, and his government exploited this violent episode to put even tighter restrictions of recruiting in Nova Scotia.Mercer, p. 236 Thomas B.

After leaving Liverpool, Whiting terrorized Shelburne by pressing inhabitants, breaking into homes, and forcing more than a dozen families to live in the forest to avoid further harassment.Mercer, p. 235  War of 1812  By the War of 1812, even the Navy had publicly exempted Nova Scotians from impressment, and groups such as the Society of Merchants campaigned against naval abuses in Nova Scotia.Mercer, p. 236 Not surprisingly, as warships were short-handed, naval captains began to violate impressment regulations in the final years of the Napoleonic Wars.Mercer, p. 238 Impressment had a negative impact on privateers in the War of 1812: dozens of men were forced into the British fleet, fear of impressment caused recruitment problems and desertions from the privateer vessels, the disputes with the Navy hindered the privateer‚Äôs ability to attack enemy shipping and protect themselves against American Warships.Mercer, p. 241 Endnotes References * Keith Mercer.

He previously worked with the country's largest newspaper, √öltimas Noticias, and is currently the director of Poderopedia and El Pitazo. In many of his writings, he has taken on issues of corruption that have put him at odds with the governments of Hugo Ch√°vez and Nicol√°s Maduro. Education and early career C√©sar Batiz graduated from the Universidad del Zulia in 1996. He has worked for the publications Panorama, La Verdad, √öltimas Noticias, and La Electricidad de Caracas. In 2008 he returned to √öltimas Noticias, the largest-circulation daily in Venezuela as an investigative journalist. The Fundaci√≥n Polar published the book La Desgracia de Ayer (\\"The Misfortune of Yesterday\\"), which includes a text that Batiz wrote after participating in a Journalism and Memory Workshop taught by Milagros Socorro. Sambrano case √öltimas Noticias published on February 22, 2009 an article in which Batiz looked into the circumstances surrounding the assassination of journalist Orel Sambrano, who had been writing columns about the rise in drug trafficking in his native city of Valencia. Injury in August 2009 demonstration Batiz was one of at least a dozen journalists who were injured by suspected government supporters while participating in a peaceful August 2009 protest in Caracas against proposed legislation that would restrict freedom of expression. The journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, ‚Äúwere holding banners and handing out leaflets warning against provisions in the bill that prohibits the distribution of content that could cause, among other things, 'terror in children', incite 'hate, aggressiveness' or 'unruliness', 'deform language', or 'threaten the mental or physical health of the people'. They were surrounded by the suspected government supporters, who accused them of being 'oligarchs' and 'enemies of the people', according to CPJ interviews with local journalists. √öltimas Noticias Editor Eleazar D√≠az Rangel told CPJ that the journalists were wearing press credentials. According to local news reports, the attackers work for the government-owned broadcaster AvilaTV‚Äù. According to Globovision, Batiz was struck in the neck and face and taken to a private hospital. The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the assault on the journalists. ‚ÄúWe are shocked by the vicious attack on journalists who were exercising their right to protest provisions of a bill that could impact their ability to report freely‚Äù, said CPJ's Carlos Laur√≠a. ‚ÄúThis is not the first time journalists have been attacked by pro-government supporters. Venezuelan authorities must do everything in their power to put an immediate end to these attacks on the press.‚Äù The National Assembly ended up approving the bill. Investigative journalism course Batiz developed the Advanced Course for Investigative Journalism, which was held in April 2011 in Lima. As part of the course, 18 regional journalists attended lectures on such topics as drug trafficking, mining, and financial institutions, after which each of them conducted a four-month research project. At the event, Batiz discussed his article ‚ÄúTrampas el√©ctricas‚Äù, about irregularities in the Venezuelan government's awarding of energy contracts. El Instituto Prensa y Sociedad (IPYS), which organized the course, recognized Batiz by awarding him a trip to the 2012 Global Investigative Journalism Conference in Kiev. Investigative journalism prize On February 24, 2011, Batiz won first place in the second Concurso Nacional de Reportajes de Investigaci√≥n Period√≠stica from El Instituto Prensa y Sociedad de Venezuela for his article ‚ÄúCon empresas fantasmas guisaron a Banorte‚Äù. The article uncovered the perpetrators of bank fraud and led to the opening of a judicial inquiry. The jury that awarded Batiz the 21,000-bolivar prize described his article as a classic of investigative journalism and commended Batiz for his mastery of the complexities of the banking industry. Ciudad Evolutiva On April 24, 2011, √öltimas Noticias published an article by Batiz about the architectural project Ciudad Evolutiva: Experiencia de integraci√≥n socio-espacial de los barrios informales, which was first presented in the form of a display in Paris in 2010 and had since been seen and written about elsewhere in Europe. The project presented a plan for urban renewal in Venezuela that, Batiz wrote, was ambitious yet achievable. Jacinto Lopez case A January 2012 article co- written by Batiz and Jesus Yajure noted that justice had yet to be done in the case of journalist, film producer, and entrepreneur Jacinto Lopez, who had been murdered at age 22 on January 1, 2009. Although two suspects had been positively identified by law-enforcement authorities, they had yet to be arrested. Illaramendi case On February 10, 2012, Batiz reported that Jose Rojas, former Venezuelan finance minister and former Venezuelan representative to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, had denied any connection to a ‚Äúfraudulent scheme‚Äù engineered by Venezuelan-American financier Illaramendi Francisco and involving funds from Petr√≥leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA). Illarramendi was being tried in the U.S. for the loss of over $300 million managed by Illarramendi's companies. Batiz reconstructed Illarramendi's movements, actions, and connections to Rojas over a period of years. Batiz reported on May 24, 2012 that although Illaramendi was currently on trial in the U.S. for using $480 million in PDVSA retirement funds to finance a Ponzi scheme, and had pleaded guilty 14 months earlier to having done just that, the First Criminal Hearings Court in the Metropolitan Area had declared that there was no case against him under Venezuelan law.

She was initially owned by Lord Ashburton and named Ladye Mabel, but came into Langtry's possession soon after as a gift from George Alexander Baird, and renamed the White Ladye. In 1893 Langtry leased the vessel to Ogden Goelet who used it until his death in 1897. It was then sold at auction to John Lawson Johnston the 'inventor' of Bovril and remained in his ownership until his death on board at Cannes France in 1900. In 1902/3 she was recorded in the Lloyd's Yacht Register as being owned by shipbuilder William Cresswell Gray, Tunstall Manor, West Hartlepool and remained so until 1915. Following this the Lloyd's Register records that she became French trawler La Champagne based in F√©camp and was broken up in 1935. Sale by auction in 1897 Lillie Langtry going ashore Langtry put the White Ladye up for auction in November 1897 at the Mart, Tokenhouse Yard, London. The yacht was described as follows: > The machinery includes a set of triple expansion engines (of 142 horsepower, > nominal), a return tubular boiler of steel, with a working pressure of 160lb > to the square inch, and she carries 130 tons of coal, of which there are now > 50 tons in her bunkers. The speed of the yacht is about thirteen knots an > hour, on a consumption of half a ton of fuel. With regard to the sanitary > equipment, there are three baths fitted with hot and cold, salt and fresh > water. The lighting throughout is electric, with pneumatic bells and > speaking tubes. There are nine sleeping apartments, exclusive of those > required for the captain, officers, and crew. The drawing room extends the > full breadth of the vessel, with grand piano, dining saloon (finished in > walnut), deck-house saloon, chart room, and galley on deck, as well as > bachelors quarters, entirely apart from the main cabins, and reached by a > separate companion way. The special feature of the yacht is a very large > state boudoir suite, extending the entire breadth of the yacht, containing > full-sized swing bed, beautifully draped. This suite is decorated in white > enamel and gold, upholstered in salmon pink broch√© panels, with silk-lined > draperies and velvet plush carpets, and furniture to match. Attached is a > dressing room, a marble bath, lavatories, and a maids room. White Ladye > carries a steam launch, gig, two cutters, and two dinghy‚Äôs. The yacht > originally cost ¬£40.000, and Mrs. Langtry had refused an offer of ¬£22,000 > for it. The steamer had been hired by the late Mr. Ogden Goelet for ¬£1000 a > month. An earlier article, written in July 1893 after White Ladye's first Atlantic crossing from Cowes to New York, said that the bunkers could hold 180 tons of coal and cruising at 11 knots 12 tons were consumed per day. The captain estimated that a direct Atlantic crossing in favourable weather could have been made in 13 days. Langtry's first cruise The White Ladye left Cowes in January 1893 for the South of France and Lillie Langtry followed by train some weeks later. The yacht hit bad weather on the journey from Cowes and some damage to the living quarters occurred which had to be repaired after arrival at Marseilles. It was during the Mediterranean cruise that Langtry learnt of the death of George Alexander Baird on March 18, 1893 in New Orleans. She immediately made for Nice and caught the train back to London. The White Ladye returned to Cowes in April of that year and by July was in America under charter to Goelet. The Goelet years Ogden Goelet was from a wealthy family of New York real estate owners and developers. He was a keen yachtsman, member of the New York Yacht Club and sponsored several yacht racing events. He chartered the White Ladye from Langtry each season from 1893 until his death in 1897. He used the yacht for socialising in America, Britain and the South of France and for attending international yacht racing regattas. The White Ladye was even used on occasions to tow premier racing yachts to events, including the Prince of Wales Britannia and Andrew Barclay Walker's Alisa. Goelet was also on friendly terms with Edward, Prince of Wales, whom he entertained on board the White Ladye, meeting Queen Victoria on one occasion in Nice, South of France when their yachts were moored next to each other. In 1897 Goelet took delivery of a new yacht at Cowes called Mayflower that he had commissioned and built on the Clyde in Scotland. This was a sister ship to one that his brother was also having constructed at the same yard - see Wikipedia article USS Nahma (SP-771). These vessels were larger and more powerful than the White Ladye but Goelet became ill and died not long after taking delivery. The Mayflower was later sold to the US Navy and became famous as the Presidential Yacht USS Mayflower (PY-1). The Lawson Johnston years John Lawson Johnston started his career as a butcher working in Edinburgh. He became interested in food science and developed a beef extract that had a long shelf life. He moved to Canada and supplied the French army with preserved beef products. On returning to Britain he set up a factory in London to manufacture a product called Bovril, boosting sales by mass advertising. He raised capital via stock flotations, the first in 1889 and the second in 1896, when he and his fellow shareholders agreed to sell the business to Ernest Terah Hooley. Lawson Johnston remained a major shareholder in Bovril and the company chairman. He purchased the White Ladye at auction in 1897 for ¬£11,200. A few weeks before this he had purchased a famous racing yacht that belonged to the Prince of Wales called Britannia. This he sold shortly after, having owned it for just a few months. It later transpired that Ernest Hooley had funded the purchase of a yacht for Lawson Johnston, and several press reports conjectured that the vessel concerned was the White Ladye. However, evidence later given in a court case by Hooley indicated that the arrangement concerned the purchase of the sailing yacht Britannia. Lawson Johnston used the White Ladye for cruising in the Mediterranean and Scottish waters, and in 1899 the yacht attended the America's Cup race in New York. The event was between Columbia and Thomas Lipton‚Äôs Shamrock. The White Ladye was supposed to be companion yacht to Lipton‚Äôs steam yacht Erin with friends and relatives on both vessels. Lawson Johnston understood that he would be able to fly a flag of privilege that enable him to manoeuvre the White Ladye within the restricted race area. However, the race officials deemed that the White Ladye had infringed a restricted zone and the captain was severely censured. To make matters worse, one of the official cutters policing the event collided with White Ladye causing damage to both vessels. In 1900 Lawson Johnston took a lease on Inveraray Castle and cruised the Scottish waters in White Ladye before the yacht sailed to Nice in the South of France. It was there that John Lawson Johnston died on board the White Ladye on the 24 November 1900. The William Cresswell Gray Years After the death of Lawson Johnston, the White Ladye was purchased by William Cresswell Gray (1867-1924). He was chairman of William Gray and Co., of West Hartlepool, one of the largest shipbuilders in the country, a business that had been started by his father in 1863. Gray became chairman in 1898 after the deaths of his older brother in 1896, his father in 1898 and Thomas Mudd, manager of the company's engine works, in 1898. Gray who, enjoyed ‚Äúyachting‚Äù, sent the White Ladye to Hull in 1903 for a new boiler and general overhaul. Sporting Life - Monday 24 August 1903; Solent Yachting Notes He arranged for the yacht to be moored in Dartmouth, due to the fact that he had purchased the Membland Estate, South Devon in 1900, about 26 miles from Dartmouth.Gray buys Membland 1900 However, by 1905 the yacht was being offered for charter, and this was taken up by the wealthy American, Bertha Palmer, widow of Potter Palmer from Chicago, who attended Cowes Week that year. She also took the prestigious Egypt House on the seafront in the expectation of entertaining high society. By 1910 the advertisements for the charter of the White Ladye also informed that the yacht was for sale.\\"Shipping.\\" Times [London, England] 30 May 1910: 2. The Times Digital Archive.

She remained in this role from September 1918 until 1926 when she was laid up at F√©camp. In June 1931 she was used to test the new slipway at F√©camp. In August 1935 she was towed by the Belgian tug Directeur Gerling out of harbour on her final journey to the breakers at Ostende.

His son Allan McFarlane sen. (1829‚Äì1908) succeeded him on the Wellington Lodge station. His grandson, Allan McFarlane jun. ran Jockwar Station, Tailem Bend, and had a son, also Allan McFarlane. Allan McFarlane and his wife Margaret (n√©e Horne) (22 November 1795 ‚Äì 17 September 1878) and their family left their home in Caithness, Scotland, and arrived in South Australia aboard the Superb on 29 October 1839. Margaret's brother Donald Horne (died 1870) was a Writer to the Signet. McFarlane was appointed Justice of the Peace some time before December 1858 and Special Magistrate in 1864. McFarlane was elected to the seat of The Murray in the South Australian House of Assembly in 1862 in a by-election occasioned by the death of Dr. David Wark. He defeated Henry Kent Hughes 20 votes to 18 (out of a constituency in excess of 200, voting not being then compulsory). With a redistribution later that year, most of his seat was subsumed in the seat of Mount Barker. and he was, with John Dunn, elected to that seat in the election held at the end of 1862. McFarlane bought Wellington Lodge station. McFarlane was for many years active with the Mount Barker Agricultural and Horticultural Society. and a Mount Barker representative on the Country Committee of the R.A.& H.S McFarlane died at his residence Ruthyn Lodge, Kensington.

It is located approximately to the southeast of Benie Hoose, not far from the steep cliffs of Yoxie Geo. The site is also known as \\"Yoxie Biggins\\". The structure is the remains of a building in a neolithic settlement called Pettigarths Field, about 4,000 years old, which also includes a megalithic tomb and Benie Hoose. The site has been compared to that of Hal Tarxien. Layout The earlier assessment that the monument was a standing stone grouping has since been revised. It is now known to consist of a building partitioned into rooms. The \\"standing stones\\" name is derived from the fact that the walls were built in part from megaliths, many of them still erect. The building was once about in size, but little remains of the northern part. There is a main L-shaped block to the west, and a smaller forecourt to the east. There are no traces of door fixtures. A paved passage lined with stone boulders runs through the house, and traces of the paving continue through a circular room that it divides into two recessed sections. Usage The site seems to have been occupied for a long period of time. There is a local belief that the stones were used for ceremonies by Druid priests who lived at Benie Hoose - or even that druids still live there. However, the ruins are 4,000 years old. There is no written mention of Druids before around 200 BC, and no reliable sources even from later periods. Despite this the excavator, C.S.T. Calder, interpreted Yoxie as the remains of a temple, and Benie Hoose as a house that may have been used by the priests. He felt there were indications that this structure, and another similar one at Stanydale on Mainland, Shetland, were used for religious purposes. If so, they would have been the first known temples in the British Isles. The placement and layout of the Benie Hoose and Yoxie seem very close to records of temples and priestly dwellings in Malta. However, early and middle neolithic society does not appear to have had complex social structures such as a priestly caste. It is now thought that both Yoxie and Benie are prehistoric houses. Artifacts Artifacts and material from the early and late Bronze Ages have been found. Some of the finds are Iron Age, while some date to the original Neolithic age settlement and others to a later occupation of the site in Iron Age. Pottery remains have been found in both houses. One large vessel found in Yoxie was very similar to a plain Bipartite Urn, possibly used for storing barley. More than 120 tools made of stone in a crude form have been unearthed in Yoxie.

It is located approximately to the northwest of Benie Hoose. The site contains upright stones as well as masonry. The south cairn is roughly square, with an eastern entrance passage and circular chamber about across. to the north is a round cairn, in diameter, with a rectangular cist. The two cairns are located on a rise, about northwest of Benie Hoose. The first archaeological explorations were carried out in 1936 and 1938. They were then inferred to be tombs belonging to the Late Stone Age and Early Bronze Age. It was excavated in 1963 by C. S. T. Calder and visited by OS (NKB) on 30 May 1968. Layout The large cairn has a paved chamber and passage. The chamber is small and is heel- shaped; it is different in layout from three other cairns found in Shetland. The passage into the cairn is through two standing boulders. It is an expanding passage where stones are seen at its inner end. Parts of the jambs are described as the \\"terminal and lateral recesses of the trefoil.\\" Some remnants of pottery were found here which could not be identified because of the fragmentary nature. The smaller, circular cairn was excavated up to its foundations. A slab covering was found in the cavity as grave robbers appeared to have tried robbing the tomb's interior.

He won a bronze medal in the discus throw at the 1950 British Empire Games and was Canadian champion for the hammer throw. The son of Manitoba politician Skuli Sigfusson and his wife Gudrun Arnason, he was born in Lundar, Manitoba. Sigfusson operated a transportation company in northern Manitoba on a system of roads, most of which he had developed himself. His company built part of the Trans-Canada Highway, as well as roads in northern Manitoba and northwestern Ontario. In 1971, his operation was shut down by the provincial government when they cancelled land-use permits which allowed the company to build winter roads to remote communities. Nicknamed \\"Bigfoot\\", Sigfusson was 6' 4\\" in height and wore size 13 track shoes. In 1938, he set a Canadian record in the hammer throw, winning the gold medal at the Canadian championships that same year. He also won silver medals in the discus, shot put, triple jump and javelin events. Sigfusson won at least nine Canadian championships between 1938 and 1954 and was named to the All-Canada track and field team in 1954. He was received the Manitoba Centennial Medal in 1970, was named to the Order of Canada in 1974 and became a member of the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame in 1982. In 1992, he published Sigfusson‚Äôs Roads (). Sigfusson died later that year.

This plant is mainly found in muddy coastal marsh waters and off the coast of many Caribbean islands. They are also found in brackish waters on the east coast of the United States in waters up to 12 meters deep. Halodule wrightii has a fast growth rate with a large shoot density that supplies efficient levels of nutrients to the plant. Rhizome growth and nutrient uptake directly affect each other which causes for such rampant size increase within the seagrass. The rhizome is horizontal underground stem that gathers nutrients for plants. This rapid growth is what makes this species a pioneer plant because it is able to adapt and develop even in oligotrophic conditions. Seagrass are a key component to coastal beaches and marsh habitats due to its importance to marine life, water quality, and nutrient availability. Ecological functions These aquatic plants form sea beds and increase habitat stabilization through constant shoot and rhizome production. The string like structure of the seagrass decrease water turbidity and movement of substrate whether it is sand or mud. Seagrass beds function as an incubator for young juvenile fishes. They provide shelter from predators and reduce competition with other species. Halodule wrightii also supplies food resources to several species of fish, invertebrate marine life and manatees. Such imperative responsibilities lie on seagrass beds, which is why protection and coastal seagrass management is so important to an ecosystem. This species of plant has the ability to adapt to various levels of salinity and temperatures making it a very versatile plant. History This plant was named after Charles Wright who was an American botanist and collector. In 1853 and 1856 Wright participated in a surveying expedition and discovered halodule wirghtii. It is commonly known as a pioneer species being that it is one of the first species present in a developing. Halodule wrightii is also able to reproduce sexually and asexually however, flowering in this species is rare. Problems with climate change Ocean acidification, which is due to an increase in atmospheric temperature and CO2 levels cause the pH in the ocean to decrease and become more acidic. This acidification process leads to the death of many marine animals, especially those made of calcium carbonate. As for halodule wrightii, a seagrass, it has an important role in the cycling of nutrients and carbon sequestration. A study conducted in Bahia, Brazil experimented on the effects of decreasing pH levels on halodule wrightii and the results expressed that phenotypic plasticity was occurring within the species. Throughout the mesocosm experiment, a sustainability level was detected among the population which concluded that there was a genetic shift. This shift demonstrates just how this plant is able to adapt to vast changes within an environment. Despite being a very resilient plant, H. wrightii still faces problems concerning increases in temperatures. When the environment that these plants reside in increase in temperature it tampers with the physiological function that allows for photosynthesis to occur thus leading to a decrease in population size. Restoration Due to anthropogenic effects, seagrass beds have suffered destruction and vast decreases in population concentration. A means to rescue the dying population is through transplantation of seagrass beds from other locations. Halodule wrightii is a pioneer species so it is commonly used to develop suffering seabeds. Recreational activities like jet skiing, and boating damage and uproot seagrass beds with ease in shallow coastal waters. Studies, such as the one performed in Brazils Abrolhos Marine National Park, tested the direct effects of anchor damage caused by intense boating activity and halodule wrightii levels were deeply impacted.

Also, the adult may not understand baby-language and cannot relate to their situation properly. Therefore, the adult often changes their persona (and communicates in a way they wouldn't with other adults) in order to try to elicit a reaction from the infant, to teach them life lessons, or to physically stimulate them. They may simplify their speech to concise sentences or words for them to repeat, or speak in nonsensical phrases (known as baby talk). They may make simple movements with their finger (such as circles) on objects for them to copy, or point to brand names/logos or people in family photos to see if they identify them. They may also choose to play one of various games, many of which are old favourites (such as Where's the baby or Got your nose). While the parents or carers may or may not choose to do this on when alone with the child, when in the presence of guests the conversation tends to either divert completely to this type of interaction or at least have these forms of interaction take place as asides in the conversation. Sometimes the interaction is onesided, with the adult taking satisfaction with their attempts, even though the infant does not react, or react without really understanding it. At other times, the interaction is two-sided, and both parties derive pleasure or other emotions from it. Some adults do not change at all when in the presence of other families' infants. Parents and infants An article in Science Daily suggested that \\"the way mothers interact with their babies in the first year of life is strongly related to how children behave later on.\\" Sometimes when caring mothers invite guests over, they become preoccupied with their child's needs, even though the infants are disruptive to the atmosphere and attention-stealing. Alex Richards recalled a post-baby party where her \\"two-month-old was good for a while, but became fussier and fussier as the night progressed\\". Sometimes, adults ignore the young children, finding them to be a nuisance or irrelevant. When this happens, they are put into playpens to fend for themselves, or left to wander the house. Amy Bowman recalls that at a dinner party, she put her 8-month-old down, and \\"as soon as she hit the ground, Katie 'sprinted' on all fours to the edge of the patio and pulled herself to standing on a lounge chair\\", rather than conversing with the adults. Games Playing games with babies can assist with: * Bonding * Motor control and hand/eye coordination * Fine and gross motor skills * Digestion and relieving constipation * Social skills and emotional development * Sensory development * Language and vocab development =Types of games= Babycenter.com identifies the following games for adults to play with babies. * Copycat: Sticking your tongue out and waiting for them to stick their tongue back in response. They can try other facial expressions such as a smile or laugh. Once the baby is more experienced, one can try things like clapping their hands or waving for the baby to imitate * Tickle songs: Singing songs like This little piggy or Round and round the garden and tickling them at the end. After repetition, the infant will \\"start...to giggle in excited anticipation of [it]\\". Games like this improve infant's memory skills. *Roll and stretch: When the baby starts being able to raise her hand when lying on her stomach, they can roll \\"a brightly colored ball across her line of vision about 60cm from her body\\". They'll stretch towards it. This exercise strengthens their neck, arm and leg muscles. * Catch me: Dangling a toy-on-a-string (preferably squeaky) in front of the babies eyes, or the infant to touch and/or grab. This exercise helps to build hand‚Äìeye co- ordination. *Bubble magic: As infants are fascinated by bubbles, one can play various bubble-related games such as blowing bubbles at them with a bubble- blowing toy. They can learn about cause and effect, by touching bubbles and watching them pop. *Puppet show: Putting on a puppet show for them. Making the puppets sing, dance, tickle and kiss etc. helps develop their imagination. * In and out: Because babies like to empty things (like handbags or boxes of tissues), one can create a game out of this by filling a large container or bowl with safe interesting objects. With the baby, empty it and play with the objects. They can learn about size, shape, weight, big, small, empty and full. *Adventure playground: Making a \\"miniature obstacle course out of cushions...and peeping out from behind them\\", place toys around the floor for them to navigate their way through. This exercise helps develop their body strength, balance and co-ordination. *Kick ball: Placing a small ball in front of the infant and encouraging them to kick it by picking them up by the arms and moving their leg towards the ball. This swinging action builds stomach and leg muscles. *Tower power: Using old or unused items like cereal boxes, lightweight books or plastic bowls, and make a tower out of them, for the infant to then knock down. They learn about shapes and sizes, and derive pleasure from watching the tower fall apart. Some other games are as follows: *Music Fun Turn on some kid songs or tunes and help the baby move and clap to the rhythm of the music by letting the baby mimic your movements. *Looking in the Mirror Take a mirror and put it in front of the baby so they can see their reflection for fun. *Hide & Seek Go hide one of the baby's favorite toy then take the baby with you to go find the toy. * Roll Ball It's for fun the kid if you just keep rolling a ball to a baby and let the baby push the ball back. Will help the baby gain motor skills. *Looking fun Go outside with your baby and let the baby enjoy the beauties of nature like the grass, flowers, trees, and the neighbor hoods animals which will probably fascinate the child. *Music From the Kitchen Making different types of sounds or music from the kitchen using tools like your pots and pans will help the child's sensory development of sound. *Outside Fun Let your kid go outside to the park or backyard so the baby can feel the outdoors. Letting the infant crawl on the grass, feel the wind, and smell the sweet odors from the flowers. A list of baby games is located at and here.

Several of the stories were written between 1943 and 1945. Lispector wrote O jantar in 1943. It was first published in the Rio de Janeiro newspaper A manh in October 1946. The story O Crime do professor de matem√°tica, was published, in an earlier version, as O Crime, in 1945 in another newspaper. In 1952, Lispector published a short volume with these stories, and four others (Love, Mystery in S√£o Crist√≥v√£o, The Beginnings of a Fortune, and The Chicken). The volume was titled Alguns contos (Some Stories), and was published by the Brazilian Ministry of Education and Health. The rest of the stories in Family Ties were completed by March, 1955, but Lispector had trouble publishing them because the Ministry would not release the rights to them, despite Lispector's many requests. Major themes Most of the stories focus on a character whose daily life‚Äîgrocery shopping in \\"Love\\", a family gathering in \\"Happy Birthday\\"‚Äîis shattered by a sudden epiphany. In this basic structure, they often resemble the later novel The Passion According to G.H.. Reflecting the author's own experience at the time, and as the title suggests, the characters in Family Ties are often housewives struggling to balance the demands of family and marriage with a wilder, less controllable life, symbolized by the experience of Ana in \\"Love\\", whose careful life breaks down when she is confronted with the wildness of a garden, in this case the Jardim Bot√¢nico of Rio de Janeiro. Literary significance and reception The stories would eventually be recognized as a high point in Brazilian literature. Two of Brazil's most famous writers immediately recognized the importance of Family Ties. Fernando Sabino wrote that \\"you've written eight stories like nobody has come even close to writing in Brazil\\", adding that the book would be \\"exactly, sincerely, indisputably, and even humbly, the best book of stories ever published in Brazil\\". Erico Verissimo told her: \\"I haven't written about your book of stories out of sheer embarrassment to tell you what I think of it. Here goes: the most important story collection published in this country since Machado de Assis,\\" who is Brazil's classic novelist.Lispector, Correspond√™ncias, √ârico Ver√≠ssimo to Lispector, September 3, 1961.

Magnatone guitar Magnatone was a brand of electric guitars and amplifiers produced between 1937 and the mid-1970s. The company was based in California. The brand name was revived in the 2010s by Ted Kornblum. History Beginning in the late 1930s, Magna Electronics produced amplifiers, Hawaiian and steel guitars. In the 1950s and 1960s, they produced vibrato-equipped amplifiers which were used by musicians including Buddy Holly and Lonnie Mack. The 'real' vibrato effect called F.M. Vibrato was distinct in sound and design from the more common tremolo circuits found on Fender amplifiers. Magnatone amplifiers began in the late 1930s as the Dickerson Musical Instrument Company founded by Delbert J. Dickerson in southern California. They made steel guitars and amplifiers designed for that instrument. In the forties Gaston Fator Guitar Studios in Los Angeles bought the business from Dickerson. Fator owned it for a few years, and then sold it to Art Duhamell around 1946. During the years Fator ran the business, there was little engineering or innovation, he basically continued the product lines Dickerson had established and continued to build amps and guitars for other manufacturers as well. In the hands of its new owner, Art Duhamell, the amplifier and guitar brand name was changed to Magnatone, and the company name was Magna Electronics Company. Duhamell built Magnatones alongside record players, radios, and speakers. By 1950, Magna expanded from their Jefferson Boulevard, Los Angeles location with three new buildings at 9749 S. Freeman Ave. and employed more than twenty-five employees. Paul Bigsby designed solid body guitars for Magnatone from 1955-1957. Pioneering blues-rock guitar soloist Lonnie Mack used Magnatone vibrato amps almost exclusively.See, Wikipedia article on Mack, subheading \\"Mack's guitar and gear\\" They are still used today by musicians including Neil Young, who uses a 280 Stereo in his live rig. Revival The brand was revived in early 2013 with a line of boutique amps, some of which are reproductions of previous Magnatone designs. The brand name was revived by Ted Kornblum (formerly of Ampeg and St. Louis Music), and input on the amps' respective designs was provided by Billy Gibbons and Neil Young's guitar tech, Larry Cragg. The new line of six different Magnatone models debuted at the 2013 NAMM Show in Anaheim, California.

The battle took place at Grauholz, a wooded hill in what is now the municipalities of Urtenen-Sch√∂nb√ºhl and Moosseedorf in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. The government of Bern had already surrendered the previous day and the Bernese defeat at Grauholz ended their resistance to the French in the north of the canton. Background Attempting to gain control of key alpine passes and establish a buffer against the hostile monarchies of Europe, France first invaded some of the associates of the Swiss Confederation. Part of the bishopric of Basel was absorbed into France in 1793. In 1797 Napoleon annexed the Valtellina on the border with Graub√ºnden into the new Cisalpine Republic in northern Italy and invaded the southern remainder of the bishopric of Basel.Swissworld.org accessed 1 February 2013 In 1798, the confederacy was invaded by the French Revolutionary Army, at the invitation of the Republican faction in Vaud, led by Fr√©d√©ric-C√©sar de La Harpe. Vaud was under Bernese control, but chafed under a government that often spoke a different language and came from a different culture. The ideals of the French Revolution had found a receptive audience in Vaud. So when Vaud revolted and declared a republic, the French had a pretext to invade the entire Confederation. The French army entered the Lemanic Republic on 24 January 1798 and Bernese troops retreated peacefully to Murten and Fribourg. French General Balthazar Alexis Henri Schauenburg deployed troops in two wings and prepared to attack from the north and south. Bern raised about 20,000 troops while the rest of the Confederation provided 4,100 support troops. The two wings of the French army had about 35,000 troops. Bern's refusal to accept a government led by the French supported Reform or Peace Party provided a pretext for an invasion. On 1 March 1798 French troops invaded Bern and the Canton of Solothurn. On the following day, the Battles of Lengnau, Twann and Grenchen and Bellach ended in French victories and the capitulation of Solothurn. On 4 March 1798, the government of Bern surrendered to the French, but the Bernese troops prepared to fight the invaders. The battle The Bernese army of about 6,400 men first met a French army of about 18,000 men at the Battle of Fraubrunnen but were driven back to Grauholz, a wooded hill near Bern. By this time General Erlach only had about two battalions of soldiers. Many women, old men, and sometimes even children of the rural population joined the fighting Bernese troops and tried to protect their city from the French invasion. An eyewitness describes many residents of the nearby village of Bollingen joining the Bernese army.Battle of Grauholz accessed 1 February 2013 The Bernese army held out for about two and a half hours against the larger French army before it finally broke. Most of the Bernese army left the woods in small groups or individually. Of the farmers from Bollingen village, a total of 27 men died in the battle. One report from 1804 stated that the Swiss had 2,000 casualties while the French suffered about 1,600 killed and more wounded. A later estimate was that Bern lost a total of about 700 men in the battles between 2‚Äì5 March 1798 but French losses in the campaign are unknown. Aftermath While General Johann Rudolf von Graffenried had won a victory against the French southern wing at Neuenegg on the same day, the surrender of the government and the defeat at Grauholz ended Bernese resistance. General Karl Ludwig von Erlach retreated with a portion of his army. He attempted to hold the Schosshalde and Felsenburg, the entrance to the Untertorbr√ºcke and the city of Bern, but was unsuccessful. He then traveled south, preparing to move into the Bernese Oberland and organize a resistance. However, at Wichtrach he was attacked by either Bernese soldiers or farmers, who believed him to be a traitor, and murdered.

It was John Gatsby who possessed twenty two pieces of Goryeo porcelains at the moment. In fact, the deal was beyond reach since the price of the twenty two was more expensive than 400,000 won which Jeon suggested. In the meantime, John finally agreed to give twenty pieces back to the homeland after finding out Jeon's work to save Korean artistic figure and kept two pieces himself. = Korean War = During Korean war, North Korean authorities harshly tried to steal all the assets of Gansong museum.

The band was composed of frontman and guitarist Sasha Frantz Carlson, guitarist/synth player Taddeo \\"Toto\\" Vivian MacDonald, bassist Thomas Beal, and synth player Jaie Gonzalez. Although formed in London, none of the band were from the city. Carlson is from Auckland, New Zealand, Vivian born in Italy and raised in Byron Bay, Australia, Beal from Shifnal, Shropshire, England and Gonzalez from Australia. The band announced on 5 June 2018 via social media that it was an end of era and that they were taking an indefinite hiatus. History =Comfort (2012‚Äì2013)= At a New Year's Eve party in December 2011 Sasha Carlson, formerly of Pineapple Head, Colours and The Coshercot Honeys/Brain Slaves first brought up the idea of forming a band with Toto Vivian, whom he had met on a previous trip to London in 2010. In February 2012 Carlson moved to London from Australia and began writing and recording songs with Vivian in Vivian's flat in Hackney. The duo then expanded their lineup to include Vivian's former INTL bandmate Tom Beal on bass, who had also previously been a member of Shropshire band Ripchord. INTL also featured Oliver Burslem and Andy Jones, who went on to form Yak. The lineup was completed with drummer Jacob Moore, who was a member of Auckland band The Checks, and joined the band shortly before Splashh's first concert on 2 May 2012. In 2012, the band signed to Luv Luv Luv records and released three 7\\" singles \\"Need It\\", \\"Vacation\\" and \\"All I Wanna Do\\" in the UK. The band released their debut studio album Comfort in the US on 4 June 2013 via Kanine Records, and in the UK on 2 September 2013 via Luv Luv Luv Records. Despite recording songs as a full band with Death in Vegas' Richard Fearless producing, Comfort was compiled from the earliest demos recorded and produced by Vivian in his home studio setup in London with just he and Carlson performing. Vivian confirmed the band's second album would be recorded as a full band, that the band regularly jammed in soundchecks and were becoming a more collaborative unit. Through 2013, the band toured extensively, playing festivals worldwide such as Field Day festival, Benicassim, Liverpool Sound City, Best Kept Secret Festival (Netherlands), Midi Festival (France), Hultsfred Festival (Sweden) and Reading and Leeds Festivals. The band also undertook a full US tour in April 2013 playing with The Generationals and Blood Red Shoes =Honey + Salt ‚Äì discarded album (2013‚Äì2016)= In November 2013 Carlson re-located to New York City where he began working with producer and multi-instrumentalist Jaie Gonzalez, with the duo performing shows together as Splashh in Brooklyn through November and December 2013. In February 2014, Vivian and Beal joined the pair to continue work on their second album, with Carlson stating that it would be more synth and loop based than their debut album. On 1 March 2014, the band announced that they had parted ways with drummer Jacob Moore, the reason for his departure was not commented on. The band sporadically toured the US throughout 2014, performing mostly new material, including shows at SXSW and the CMJ festival in New York City. New songs premiered included \\"646\\", \\"Comeback Soon\\", \\"Under The Moon\\", \\"Pure Blue\\", \\"Feel It 2\\" and \\"Colour It In\\". On 29 September 2014 the band posted the music video for \\"Colour It In\\" and put the song on SoundCloud. On 10 October 2014 before Splashh's CMJ 2014 performances the band announced that Brooklyn-based, Australian-born musician Angus Tarnawsky would join the group on drums. Tarnawsky is also a member of Apache Beat and has toured with Temples, Brian Chase and Au.Ra. In March 2015, Splashh played their first shows in the UK since November 2013. Comeback single \\"Pure Blue\\" was released as a 12\\" single in November 2015 via Luv Luv Luv. The song was recorded in Vivian's London home studio and features Dominic Boyce, from Peace, on drums. It was mixed by New York-based producer Nicolas Vernhes. The band split time between London and New York from 2014 to early 2016, working on material for their second album entitled Honey + Salt, commenting on the change in direction, Vivian commented that they had \\"always wanted to move into more experimental, synth-based dance music\\", with Carlson adding that they had become \\"massively bored\\" of their previous material. =Waiting a Lifetime (2016‚Äì2018)= On 4 May 2016, the band announced that they had signed to the Cinematic Music Group label and were set to record their second album Waiting A Lifetime in New York the following week - abandoning the previous work over the last two years and returning to their garage rock guitar sound.

Because Japan is a leading nation in the Asian economy and international politics, the organisation feels an obligation to encourage Japanese women to take a leading role in advocacy for improved human rights. Additionally, Japan is the destination for the largest number of cross-border human trafficking victims in Asia, which AJWRC takes as further impetus for their mission.AWORC member profile Disparity between genders has been shrinking in most developed countries over the last century, but AJWRC holds that Japan has lagged behind the trend. As examples, women represent a mere 10% of the National Diet, Japan's legislative body, and women earn just 60% of the salary of their male counterparts in the workforce. AJWRC grew out of the Asian Women's Association, which was founded in 1977, when gender inequality was even more severe.

The purpose of knitr is to allow reproducible research in R through the means of Literate Programming. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License.https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr knitr was inspired by Sweave and written with a different design for better modularization, so it is easier to maintain and extend. Sweave can be regarded as a subset of knitr in the sense that all features of Sweave are also available in knitr. Some of knitr's extensions include the R Markdown format (used in reports published on RPubs), caching, TikZ graphics and support to other languages such as Python, Perl, C++, Shell scripts and CoffeeScript, and so on. knitr is officially supported in the RStudio IDE for R, LyX, Emacs/ESS and the Architect IDE for data science. Workflow of knitr Knitr consists of standard e.g. Markdown document with R-code chunks integrated in the document. The code chunks can be regarded as R-scripts that * load data, * performs data processing and * creates output data (e.g. descriptive analysis) or output graphics (e.g. boxplot diagram). The implementation of logical conditions in R can provide text elements for the dynamic report depended on the statistical analysis. For example: The Wilcoxon Sign test was applied as statistical comparison of the average of two dependent samples above. In this case, the calculated P-value was 0.56 and hence greater than the significance level (0.05 by default). This implies that \\"H0: there is no difference between the results in data1 and data2\\" cannot be rejected. The text fragments are selected according to the script's results. In this example, if the P-value was lower than the significance level, different text fragments would be inserted in the dynamic report. In particular, the second sentence would swap \\"less\\" for \\"greater,\\" and the third sentence would be replaced to reflect rejection of the null hypothesis. Using this workflow allows creating new reports simply by supplying new input data, ensuring the methodology is reproduced identically.

It was the sixth flight for SpaceX's uncrewed Dragon cargo spacecraft, and the fourth SpaceX operational mission contracted to NASA under a Commercial Resupply Services contract. The mission brought equipment and supplies to the space station, including the first 3D printer to be tested in space, a device to measure wind speed on Earth, and small satellites to be launched from the station. It also brought 20 mice for long-term research aboard the ISS. Launch history Liftoff of SpaceX CRS-4 aboard a Falcon 9 rocket on 21 September 2014 Dragon capsule splashing down in the Pacific Ocean on 25 October 2014 After a scrub due to poor weather conditions on 20 September 2014, the launch occurred on Sunday, 21 September 2014 at 05:52 UTC from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Primary payload NASA contracted for the CRS-4 mission and therefore determined the primary payload, date/time of launch, and target orbital parameters. The CRS-4 lifted off on 21 September 2014 with a payload consisted of of cargo, including of crew supplies. The cargo included the ISS-RapidScat, a Scatterometer designed to support weather forecasting by bouncing microwaves off the ocean's surface to measure wind speed, which was launched as an external payload to be attached on the end of the station's Columbus laboratory. CRS-4 also includes the Space Station Integrated Kinetic Launcher for Orbital Payload Systems (SSIKLOPS), which will provide still another means to release other small satellites from the ISS. In addition, CRS-4 carried a new permanent life science research facility to the station: the Bone Densitometer (BD) payload, developed by Techshot, which provides a bone density scanning capability on ISS for utilization by NASA and the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS). The system measures bone mineral density (and lean and fat tissue) in mice using Dual- Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA). The Rodent Research Hardware System was also carried to the ISS as part of the payload. Secondary payloads SpaceX has primary control over manifesting, scheduling and loading secondary payloads. However, there are certain restrictions included in their contract with NASA that preclude specified hazards on the secondary payloads, and also require contract-specified probabilities of success and safety margins for any SpaceX reboosts of the secondary satellites once the Falcon 9 second stage has achieved its initial low-Earth orbit (LEO). The CRS-4 mission carried the 3D Printing in Zero-G Experiment to the ISS, as well as a small satellite as secondary payload that will be deployed from the ISS: SPINSAT. It also brought 20 mice for long-term physiological research in space. =3D Printing in Zero-G Experiment= The 3D Printing in Zero-G Experiment will demonstrate the use of 3D printing technology in space. 3D printing works by the process of extruding streams of heated material (plastic, metal, etc.) and building a three-dimensional structure layer-upon-layer. The 3D Printing in Zero-G Experiment will test the 3D printer specifically designed for microgravity, by Made In Space, Inc., of Mountain View, California. Made In Space's customized 3D printer will be the first device to manufacture parts away from planet Earth. The 3D Printing in Zero-G Experiment will validate the capability of additive manufacturing in zero-gravity. This experiment on the International Space Station is the first step towards establishing an on-demand machine shop in space, a critical enabling component for deep-space crewed missions and in- space manufacturing. =SPINSAT= SPINSAT is a -diameter sphere built by the US government Naval Research Lab (NRL) to study atmospheric density. SPINSAT is a technology demonstrator for electric solid propellant (ESP) thrusters from Digital Solid State Propulsion (DSSP). DSSP's technology utilizes electric propulsion to enable small satellites to make orbital maneuvers that have generally not been possible in the very small, mass-constrained satellites such as CubeSats and nanosats. This will be DSSP's first flight and will be deployed from the Kibo module airlock. NASA safety experts approved the mission‚Äîwhich by its nature must start with the satellite inside the habitable volume of the ISS‚Äîbecause the satellite's 12 thruster-clusters burn an inert solid fuel, and then only when an electric charge is passed across it. = Rodent Research Hardware System = The mission also brought 20 mice to live on the ISS for study of the long-term effects of microgravity on the rodents using the Rodent Research Hardware System. First stage landing attempt The Falcon 9 first stage for the CRS-4 mission re-entered the atmosphere over the Atlantic Ocean off the East Coast of the United States. Its re-entry was captured on video by a NASA WB-57 aircraft as part of research into high-speed Mars atmospheric entry. In November 2015, a panel from this first stage was found floating off the Isles of Scilly in the southwest United Kingdom. Although much of the media suggested the part came from the later CRS-7 launch which exploded, SpaceX confirmed it came from CRS-4. Dragon reuse The structural core of the CRS-4 Dragon capsule, C106, was refurbished and reused in the SpaceX CRS-11 mission, the first Dragon capsule to be reused.

Background On January 28, 2013, Fox Television Stations and Weigel Broadcasting announced the formation of Movies!, with plans to launch the network on Memorial Day of that year. Movies! officially launched on May 27, 2013, at 8:10 a.m. Eastern Time, initially debuting on the subchannels of both of the network's co-parents: five Fox and 11 MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated stations owned by Fox Television Stations, and two stations owned by Weigel. Its programming was inaugurated by a ten-minute clip introducing the network, followed by the first film to be telecast on Movies!, the 1975 film Western Take a Hard Ride. Programming =Movies= Described as presenting \\"a variety of theatrical motion pictures in a new, viewer and advertiser friendly format, not seen on broadcast television to date\\", films featured on Movies! as of 2020 primarily consist of releases from Warner Bros. and Sony Pictures Entertainment, but the network also shows content from ViacomCBS, Shout! Factory, ITV Studios, ReTV, Peter Rodgers Organization, Multicom Entertainment Group, Proven Entertainment, Xenon Pictures and Legacy Distribution. Before January 2020, the network primarily aired releases from 20th Century Fox. The network's film roster concentrates mainly on classic films from the 1920s to the 1980s, though in recent years, films from the 1990s and select films from the 2000s and 2010s are also played. As of August 2019, Movies! broadcasts featured movie presentations such as Noir to Die For all day every Thursday, Saturday Morning Movies! consisting of films from the Hopalong Cassidy, Laurel and Hardy and Blondie franchises, Popcorn Movies! every Saturday afternoon, Definitive Movies! every Saturday night and Sunday Night Noir. Movies! presents many of its features in their original aspect ratio (widescreen or full screen) whenever possible, which are either presented in the 16:9 or 4:3 letterboxed format depending on the affiliate's preference in transmitting the subchannel. Scope films, however, are often reformatted from 2.35:1 to 1.85:1. Films that are broadcast on the network are edited for graphic profanity and inappropriate violent or sexual content, but are not edited for running times to fit in a set time block; start and end times for films airing on the network are influenced by a combination of the film's original running time and the commercial breaks inserted within the broadcast (the network limits the amount of advertising featured during its programming to twelve minutes per hour), Wednesday, 28 December 2016 with airtimes for films varying between the conventional top-and-bottom-of-the-hour scheduling (e.g., 6:30 a.m. or 8:00 p.m.) and incremental airtimes in margins of five minutes (e.g., 2:10 p.m. or 3:55 a.m.) that more closely mirror the scheduling structures of premium cable channels than those of other advertiser-supported networks (this scheduling format, which still results in a particular film's running time to be somewhat longer than the original runtime of its theatrical release depending on the content edits, was replicated by GetTV when it launched in February 2014). =Children's programming= In order to meet requirements imposed by the Federal Communications Commission on the amount of educational programming content that a broadcast station must air each week, Movies! airs a three-hour block of children's programs that were originally distributed for syndication on Sunday mornings (currently featuring Dog Tales Classics, Word Travels and Made in Hollywood: Teen Edition). This allows its affiliates to carry the network's full schedule without having to purchase E/I programming from the syndication market to comply with the rules. Affiliates As of July 2014, Movies! has current or pending affiliation agreements with television stations in 43 media markets encompassing 22 states and the District of Columbia, covering approximately 49% of the United States. Fox Television Stations and Weigel Broadcasting launched Movies! in markets served by a station owned-and-operated by the Fox network or its sister programming service MyNetworkTV. Not all of the Fox Television Stations outlets carried Movies! at launch, WJZY in Charlotte (which came under Fox ownership one month prior to the network's debut) did not begin carrying Movies! until July 1, 2014, due to an existing affiliation agreement with Antenna TV. In Chicago‚Äîwhere Fox Television Stations and Weigel Broadcasting each own television stations‚ÄîFox-owned WPWR-TV serves as that market's charter affiliate of the network, instead of one of Weigel's three stations in that market (WCIU-TV, WWME-CA and WMEU-CD). This makes Movies! the first Weigel- owned network in which the company's Chicago flagship stations do not serve as affiliates (WCIU formerly carried This TV under Weigel ownership before it moved to WGN-TV upon becoming part-owned by Tribune Broadcasting in November 2013, and MeTV is carried on WWME-CD and relayed a subchannel of WCIU). WBND- LD in South Bend, Indiana carries Movies! on its third digital subchannel; WMLW-TV in Milwaukee carried the network from its launch until August 4, 2014, when Movies! moved to a newly created secondary subchannel of ABC affiliate WISN-TV. Following the WISN deal, that station's owner Hearst Television signed affiliation agreements on a piecemeal basis to add Movies! to select stations, mainly those affiliated with networks other than ABC, during late 2014 and early 2015 (Hearst already carries sister network MeTV in a majority of the markets where it owns stations). In addition to its carriage on the Fox- and Weigel-owned outlets at the network's launch, the network is also carried on the digital subchannels of television stations owned by other broadcasting companies. Soon after its launch, Movies! reached distribution agreements with several broadcasting groups to add the network on the subchannels of some of their stations. The first stations outside of the Fox and Weigel outlets to sign deals to carry the network were KFFV in Seattle, WLWC in Providence (both owned by OTA Broadcasting) and KPXJ in Shreveport (owned by KTBS, LLC) in October 2013, with the three stations adding the network between November 10 and December 10. The following month, in November 2013, Movies! signed affiliation agreements with nine stations owned by Bonten Media Group, Cocola Broadcasting and the Maranatha Broadcasting Company. Four additional stations (in Salt Lake City; Boise; Wausau; and Victoria, Texas), through deals with companies such as the Nexstar Broadcasting Group and Saga Communications, added the network between May and October 2014.

The Fort Smith Artillery elected David Provence as captain on September 17, 1861 and was transferred east of the Mississippi River following the Confederate defeat at the Battle of Pea Ridge. Rebuilding Arkansas Confederate Artillery After the battle of Pea Ridge, General Earl Van Dorn was ordered to move his Army of the West across the Mississippi River and cooperate with Confederate forces in Northern Mississippi. Van Dorn stripped the state of military hardware of all types, including almost all the serviceable artillery. When General Thomas C. Hindman arrived to assume command of the new Trans-Mississippi District, he found almost nothing to command. He quickly began organizing new regiments, but his most pressing need was for arms for the new forces he was organizing, including the artillery. With Hindman's first order, dated May 31, 1862 at Little Rock, he announced his staff, including the appointment of Major Francis A. Shoup, Chief of Artillery.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Hindman's First Order\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, posted 21 August 2004, Accessed 15 December 2012, http://history-sites.com/cgi-bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/arch_config.pl?read=8219 Hindman ordered guns, which the United States Arsenal had decommissioned and buried as property markers around the Arsenal in Little Rock, to be dug up and refurbished as best possible as serviceable weapons.Taylor, Doyle, \\"Re: Arms availability in the Trans-Mississippi\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 31 January 2004, Accessed 15 December 2012, http://history- sites.com/cgi-bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/arch_config.pl?read=6467 Hindman was almost totally destitute of military quality weapons and could hardly arm or issue ammunition to the few troops that he had in June 1862. In July 1862, General Hindman wrote describing his efforts at organization and his need for arms for his men. General Hindman ordered two enterprising young staff officers, Captain R.A. Hart and Major J.B. Lockman to travel to Grenada, Jackson, Columbus, Mississippi and other depots, with requisitions for ordnance and ordnance stores, instructing them to take even condemned articles, and to bring them to Arkansas by the most practicable route. Arms and cannon secured by these two were moved to Gaines Landing on the Mississippi River, where they were loaded onto flatboats and moved across the river between Union gunboat patrols. Apparently this activity did not go unnoticed by Union forces operating along the river:. By August 5, 1862, General Hindman wrote to General Cooper describing the improvement in his supply situation At the same time, General Mosely M. Parson's Brigade returned to Arkansas from Van Dorn's Army in Mississippi in August 1862. General Parson brought with him a wagon train of quartermaster supplies and five pieces of artillery. The quantity of guns supplied led to the organization and reorganization of several Artillery batteries in August and September 1862 in Arkansas. Organization The organization of Reid's Arkansas Battery apparently occurred in the summer of 1862 as Hindman attempted to build Confederate forces in Arkansas. On July 17, 1862, General Hindman issued Special Order #29 which directed Captain Reed to report to Col Carroll who was commanding Northwest Arkansas. Reid was to take four iron guns to be turned over to a Capt Pratt. Capt Shelby or the commanding officer of Shelby's infantry company was to proceed with his company with Capt Reed to Fort Smith. ... Capt Pratt was ordered to turn over to Reed the four iron pieces and will receive from Capt Daniels and Capt Woodruff two guns each.Odom, Danny, \\"Re: Reid's Arkansas Battery at Prairie Grove\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 1/22/2013, Accessed 2 February 2013, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs62x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?md=read;id=27748 On July 27, 1862, Colonel Carrol reported the arrival of Captain Ried's battery at Fort Smith, Arkansas.Carroll, Charles A.

In the reorganization of the Confederate Army following its retreat from northwest Arkansas, Reid's Battery was disbanded. On December 24, 1862, General Hindman directed Captain Reid to report to Colonel David Providence, Chief of Artillery at Fort Smith, Arkansas with his battery. Reid was to turn in the guns, equipments, and horses, which were to be turned over to General Frost's and General Fagan's Division. Any items not needed by these commands were to be turned over to the Chief of Ordnance or Post Quarter Master.

There are two distinct forms of forfeiture. One occurs when a team is unable (or refuses) to meet the basic standards for playing the game, either before the game begins or as a result of actions that happen during the match. In such a case, the team not forfeiting wins the match. Another is punitive forfeiture, in which a team has been found to have broken the rules of a sanctioning body during a match they have won and must have the results stricken from the record; whether or not the other team receives a win in such a case depends on the rules of that body.  Association football  Both teams must have at least seven players at the beginning of the match per the Laws of the Game. When a team has fewer than seven players, the match cannot start or continue.IFAB: Laws of the Game 2016/2017, Law 3 When the number of players in a team falls definitely below seven (e.g. by five players sent off with red cards, or by injured players with no substitutions left, or a combination of both), the match is forfeited. Forfeits are also used as ex post disciplinary sanctions by governing bodies. A forfeited match is handled differently in various competitions; FIFA Disciplinary Code punishes the team sanctioned with a forfeit with a 3‚Äì0 loss (but the result on the pitch is upheld if the goal difference at the end of the match was three or greater). Forfeited games also could be identified with what is known as a \\"technical score\\" like +/-, +:-, where a plus sign (+) signifies a win and a minus sign (-) stands for a loss. Traditionally, technical score is implied as 3:0 score, but earlier in history it also used to be understood as 2:0 score. Beside forfeiture, technical score could be applied for disciplinary sanctions on various of administrative matter such as violence on the field, use of ineligible players, others. Because it is a \\"cabinet\\" score, unless specified in season's (league's) regulations or official executive decision of governing sports organization, the technical score not necessarily has to carry any numerical value.  Baseball  In rare cases, baseball games are forfeited, usually in the event when a team is no longer able to play.  Basketball  In the basketball rules published by FIBA, a forfeit and a default are two different things. A team will forfeit if: * Fifteen minutes after the scheduled starting time, the team is not present or is unable to field five players ready to play. * Its actions prevent the game from being played. * It refuses to play after being instructed to do so by the referee. A forfeit results in loss for the offending team by a score of 20‚àí0, and in tournaments that use the FIBA points system for standings, zero points for the match. Furthermore, in FIBA tournaments that use a two-game home-and-away series (two-legged tie) or a best-of-three playoff format, a team that forfeits a game also loses the series by forfeit. In FIBA tournaments, a team will default if, at any time during a game, they have less than two players ready to play (by reason of players being injured, fouling out or being ejected). In this case, the opponents are awarded with a win, and if they are leading, the score at the time of stoppage will be the final score; if they are not leading, they are awarded a 2‚àí0 win. In tournaments that use the FIBA points system for standings, a team that lost by default earns 1 point the FIBA points system for standings. Furthermore, in FIBA tournaments that use a two-game home-and- away series, a team that defaults in either game automatically loses the series by default, earning 1 point for the series. In tournaments and leagues that use winning percentage to rank teams, the difference between a forfeit and a default is negligible. However, for those that use the FIBA points system, a default is treated like an ordinary loss (as the team earns one point) while a team that forfeited earns zero points. It is also detrimental in tiebreaking situations as a defaulting team's worst result is the actual score if they were trailing when the game was stopped, or a 2‚Äì0 loss if they were leading, while a forfeit is deemed to be a 0‚Äì20 loss, which drags down a team's goal average worse than a 0‚Äì2 loss would. =NCAA= In U.S. NCAA basketball, a referee decides a game is to be forfeited when any of these criteria are satisfied: * Any player, squad member or bench personnel fails to comply with any technical foul penalty and/or makes a travesty of the game. * When conditions warrant. * A team refuses to play after being instructed to do so by an official. The forfeiting team loses the game 2‚àí0 unless 30 minutes have elapsed on the game clock; in this case, the score at the end of play shall stand. If the team that is behind in the scorebook is to be declared the winning team, that score shall be marked with an asterisk in the official statistics, and it shall be noted that the game was won by forfeit. In March 2015, a women's basketball game between Southern and Texas Southern was declared a double forfeit by the officials because of a brawl 30 minutes into the game; however, the conference declared Southern, who was leading the game 51-49 when it was abandoned, the winner. It is somewhat unclear if the NCAA recognizes Southern as the winner or if they recognize the game as a double forfeit. https://www.espn.com/womens-college- basketball/story/_/id/12442067/brawl-leads-double-forfeit-southern-texas- southern-women-game =NBA= The rules of the National Basketball Association do not mention how forfeitures are dealt with, but mention it is a possible sanction on a player or coach who violates the rules on ejections. Also, in the NBA, defaulting is virtually impossible unless injuries or ejections bring a team to fewer than five players. When five players remain in a game and one fouls out, the player remains in the game and the player is in a player foul penalty situation. The rule also applies when (after an injury) a player who fouled out of the game previously returns to the game, where re-entering the game after fouling out places the player in the player foul penalty, resulting in a non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul (may not be ejected). One free throw is awarded, regardless of offensive or defensive foul or re-entry caused by injury. Ice Hockey =NHL= Under National Hockey League rules, a team forfeits a game when they fail to comply with the rules to an extent that the Referee or the Commissioner of the league (or his designee) refuses to allow the game to continue because of that team's actions. If the game is forfeited prior to the start of the game, the result will be a 1-0 victory to the non- offending team, however, no players will be credited with any personal statistics. If the game was in progress at the time it is declared forfeited, the score shall be recorded as zero for the loser and 1, or the number of goals scored, to the winning team. All players will be credited with any personal statistics earned until the game was forfeited. =IIHF= Under IIHF rules, a team will forfeit the game if: * A team that refuses to begin play with the prescribed number of players on ice, * A team will forfeit the game to its opponent if it cannot place the required number of players on the ice during the course of a game because of penalties and injuries. * If a team declines to participate in the penalty-shot shootout or, * If a team repeatedly refuses to start play after being ordered to do so by the referee. There is no rule pertaining to the procedure as to how a forfeited game is to be scored.  Chess  As well as checkmate, chess games can be resigned or lost on time, but the term \\"forfeit\\" generally has a narrower meaning in the game. A forfeit occurs when a player does not appear at the match, and is generally a rare occurrence. A notable instance of forfeiture happened in the second game of the 1972 World Chess Championship. Bobby Fisher, due to disputes over the organisation of the match, refused to show, and the game was recorded as a win for his opponent. Additionally, a player caught cheating will lose by forfeit.  Cricket  In the sport of cricket a forfeiture occurs when a captain chooses to forfeit one of his side's innings. Gaelic games In the Gaelic games of hurling, Gaelic football, camogie and ladies' Gaelic football, a forfeit is called a walkover (). The team that concedes a game in a competition may receive further punishment, such as a fine, deduction of league points or automatic relegation. The most famous walkover in GAA history came in the 1910 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final. Louth were awarded the championship as Kerry refused to travel to Dublin for the final because the Great Southern and Western Railway would not grant fans, players and officials discounted fares for the trip.  Gridiron football  In American football, a team must begin with at least seven players (the number legally required to man a line of scrimmage) ready to play; a forfeiture occurs if a team does not have that many. It can also occur when the number of able players drops to below seven at any point during the game, as a result of an unfair act, or punitive retroactive sanctions against a team from a governing body such as the NCAA. In the event the team forfeiting the game is already losing at the time of the forfeit, the score at the time stands as is. Otherwise, forfeits result in a 2‚Äì0 score in the National Football League or a 1‚Äì0 score in high school football, NCAA and Canadian football. In the case of high school and the NCAA, the forfeit is one of only two ways for a team to finish with a score of only one point (the other theoretical possibility is if a team's only score comes from a defensive safety, i.e. a botched conversion attempt that results in their opponent getting backed all the way back into their own end zone). The National Football League rulebook has a provision for forfeiture but has never used it (there was at least one alleged \\"forfeit\\" in the 1921 NFL season, but because league schedules were so fluid in the 1920s and it was never clear who was at fault for the game not being played, the league now considers it a cancellation, which was very common at the time). Former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle noted that he had never used the league's forfeit provisions and would never change the result of a game after the fact, a stance that prevented the result of the Snowplow Game, a game that had been decided on an acknowledged but unpunished unfair act, from being forfeited. It was briefly discussed after a botched call in the 2018‚Äì19 NFC Championship Game, but interfering with the results of a game after it has finished would cause logistical chaos and massive expense in having to reschedule games, especially in the playoffs. The NFL threatened forfeiture during the 2020 NFL season if coronavirus- related protocols were not adhered to.https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-stresses- new-covid-19-protocols-in-memo-says-violations-that-result-in-sched NFL policy states that the winning team is not paid their weekly salary if their opponent forfeits the game.https://www.radio.com/wgr550/sports/bills/if-titans-forfeit- bills-players-will-also-not-get-paid The NCAA also uses punitive forfeiture in other sports. The Arena Football League has had one forfeit in its history, which came in 2012 as a result of a player's strike. In another case in 2015, two teams ceased operations prior to the end of the season, and because they were both slated to play each other, the game was recorded as a scoreless tie. A related concept is to vacate results, in which a team's wins are stricken from the record. NCAA bylaws allow wins to be vacated as a form of punishment (see for example the 2005 Orange Bowl), although the NFL does not. Note that a loss is not put in place of a vacated win, and a win is not retroactively awarded to the losing team. Once a team loses a game, even if the winning team's victory is later vacated, it is still considered a loss.  Handball  In handball a game which results in a forfeit loss is counted 0‚Äì10 unless the goal difference of the game was bigger than the game result.  Poker  In cases where a poker game is arranged but an opponent drops out or folds (a fold is when a player gives up for multiple reasons), that person forfeits and remaining players win at that player's expense.

Plot The tale of \\"The Wonderful Toymaker\\" begins with a spoiled princess named Petulant, an eight-year-old girl who cannot be pleased at any cost. Her father, the King, gathers his council together to help find a toy for the Princess that will surpass all others. The Prime Minister volunteers his son Martin to find the princess a special toy. Martin talks with Princess Petulant and promises to return in four weeks with an amazing toy. At the beginning of Martin's journey he encounters Bobolink, the Purple Enchanter who knows everything. Martin hopes that Bobolink will help him to find his way to The Wonderful Toymaker. However, Bobolink is annoyed about having to provide information about everything to everyone, and is initially reluctant to assist Martin. Martin's lack of flattery towards him serves as a refreshing change, and Bobolink soon becomes quite eager to help him. Bobolink tells Martin that his next step is to reach the pine dwarfs, warning him to avoid conversation with the creatures or he will be stuck in the country of conversation forever. Martin almost makes it through the country of conversation without a single word, but he becomes distracted and engages in conversation with a fish. Martin's error forces him to \\"become conversation,\\" and suddenly he is trapped with no way out. The princess continues to wait patiently but she eventually becomes very upset that Martin has not returned with her toy. The council becomes worried, and contemplates where Martin could possibly be. The Princess, alone and sobbing, is confronted by a pine dwarf who promises to bring her to the waterfall and show her the way to Martin. The Princess stuffs her ears with cotton and begins her journey. Princess Petulant finally makes it to Martin without speaking a single word, and they are both able to escape. The two run as fast as they can to the toyshop. The Toymaker, so pleased to see them, wishes that they stay and play with him forever. Martin and Princess Petulant play with the best toys they have ever seen, finally satisfying the Princess‚Äô desire for a new toy. Martin and Princess Petulant tell the Toymaker that they are unable to stay and although he is sad, he assists them in their journey home.

Military career An incident at the Battle of Tamai, eastern Sudan, March 13, 1884 by Godfrey Douglas Giles In 1883 MacRae joined the 1st battalion The Royal Highland Regiment (The Black Watch) as a lieutenant. The following year he was posted to Egypt where the regiment was engaged in the Mahdist War, and took part in the battle of Tamai (13 March 1884). In September he was placed in charge of a division of boats as part of the Nile Expedition under General Earle. The expedition was unsuccessful in its aim of relieving the Siege of Khartoum, and was attacked at Kirbekan in February 1885. MacRae was mentioned in despatches after the engagement, in which the Mahdists were defeated. He also received the Egypt Medal and a bronze Khedive's Star. The British subsequently withdrew from Sudan, and MacRae was sent with his regiment to Malta, returning to Perth in 1889. The following year he was promoted to Captain, and in 1901 he was appointed to the Royal Company of Archers, the sovereign's ceremonial bodyguard in Scotland. Marriage to the Gilstraps Ballimore House On 4 March 1889 John MacRae married Isabella Mary Gilstrap, second daughter of the late George Gilstrap of Newark, at St Peter's, Eaton Square, London. Isabella was the niece and co-heiress of Sir William Gilstrap, Bt., a wealthy maltster and philanthropist. On Sir William's death in 1896, under the terms of his will, John MacRae took the additional surname of Gilstrap and assumed a senior role in the family firm of Gilstrap, Earp & Co., then the largest malt-producing business in Britain. In 1897 the MacRae- Gilstraps were living at 65 Northgate, Newark, and in 1899 they purchased Ballimore House at Otter Ferry in Argyll. Chiefship of Clan Macrae John MacRae-Gilstrap was a senior member of the MacRae family of Conchra, descended from Alexander MacRae who in 1677 received a wadset (mortgage) of the lands of Conchra on Loch Long, north of Eilean Donan.Macrae (1910), p.152 The MacRaes of Conchra are one of several branches of the clan tracing their ancestry back to Fionnla Dubh mac Gillechriosd, the reputed progenitor of the Clan MacRae, the other principal families being MacRae of Inverinate, MacRae of Torlysich, and the Clann Ian Charrich, who claim descent from an even earlier ancestor.Macrae (1910), pp.vii‚Äìviii Each of these principal families has claimed seniority over the others, and although the Rev. Alexander MacRae's History of the Clan MacRae, first published in 1899, places the Inverinate branch in the senior position, the matter continued to be debated. Regardless of seniority, no MacRae had ever been formally recognised as chief of the clan. The MacRaes were closely allied to the Clan Mackenzie, serving as the personal bodyguard to their chief, Mackenzie of Kintail (later the Earl of Seaforth), and acquiring the nickname \\"Mackenzie's Shirt of Mail\\".Macrae (1910), p.8 In 1909, Sir Colin MacRae of Inverinate submitted a petition to Lord Lyon, the heraldic authority in Scotland, claiming the right to use a historical coat of arms as Chief of the Name of MacRae, and stating that his family had long been unofficially acknowledged as chiefs. John MacRae-Gilstrap had previously placed a \\"caveat\\" with the Lord Lyon, requesting that \\"should any application be presented in the Court of The Lord Lyon for matriculation of arms as Chief of The Clan MacRae\\", then he would be notified and offered the opportunity to speak. The petition was duly heard at the Lyon Court, at which Macrae-Gilstrap was challenged as to his right to appear, since he was not the most senior representative of his own family. He responded that \\"I am here to protect myself and to say that I will not acknowledge the Inverinate branch in any shape or form as the Chief of the Clan MacRae and as my Chief.\\" He continued by maintaining that \\"all the MacRae families are more or less on an equality\\", and argued that the MacRaes were a clan \\"which had no chief other than Seaforth\\".Eyre-Todd (1923), p.426 He also denied the seniority of the Inverinate family despite apparently conceding their seniority on a previous occasion, whereby he was accused by Sir Colin's counsel of picking and choosing his evidence. In coming to a decision, announced in April 1909, the Lord Lyon, James Balfour Paul, confined himself to questions of heraldry. He found that Sir Colin had failed to prove his right to the use of chiefly arms, and did not therefore explore the question of the chiefship itself. Debates continued as to the merits of recognising a clan chief, with Sir Colin continuing to refer to himself as chief, and MacRae-Gilstrap continuing to reiterate his opposition to Sir Colin's claim. Restoration of Eilean Donan Eilean Donan Castle Eilean Donan Castle, probably first built in the 13th century, was a stronghold of the Mackenzies of Kintail who appointed several generations of the Clan MacRae as constables. The last constable, Rev. Farquhar MacRae who was removed in 1651, was an ancestor of John MacRae- Gilstrap. During the failed Jacobite rising of 1719 the castle was occupied by Spanish troops and was demolished by government forces after the Spaniards surrendered. By 1912 the castle, located on an island in Loch Duich on the western coast of Lochalsh, had been reduced to a few fragments of masonry.Gifford (1992), pp.531‚Äì533 In 1912 MacRae-Gilstrap purchased Eilean Donan Castle from Sir Keith Fraser of Inverinate, becoming the first MacRae for many years to hold land in the traditional clan territory of Kintail. Initially MacRae-Gilstrap intended to preserve the ruins as they were and employed a local stonemason, Farquhar MacRae, to clear the site. He was engaged during the First World War, but returning to Kintail in 1919 he found Farquhar MacRae making preparations for a full restoration of the castle. Farquhar \\"claimed to have had a dream in which he saw, in the most vivid detail, exactly the way the castle originally looked\\".Marigold MacRae, quoted in MacRae-Gilstrap agreed to go ahead with the reconstruction, and commissioned architect George Mackie Watson to prepare plans. The castle was fully rebuilt between the years 1920 and 1932. In the latter year the bridge to the mainland was completed, and a formal opening ceremony was held on 22 July 1932. The total cost of the restoration was around ¬£250,000, largely funded by the Gilstrap inheritance. Death and descendants John MacRae- Gilstrap died in January 1937 at Eilean Donan, and was buried at the historic MacRae cemetery at Clachan Duich, at the head of Loch Duich. Isabella lived on until 1949. John and Isabella had five daughters and one son. His estates passed to his son, Captain Duncan MacRae (1890‚Äì1966), and then to his son, John MacRae (1925‚Äì1988). John MacRae opened Eilean Donan to the public in 1955, and established the Conchra Charitable Trust in 1983 to care for the castle. His daughter Baroness Miranda van Lynden, great-granddaughter of John MacRae-Gilstrap, is the present head of the MacRaes of Conchra.

Migration history The settlement in Shashamane traces its roots to the 1948 Shashamane Land Grant by Emperor Haile Selassie I to members of the Ethiopian World Federation in gratitude for their defence of Ethiopia during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Most of the initial settlers who took advantage of this offer were African American, but Jamaicans began coming in the 1960s. They quickly came to form a notable presence in the Shashamane settlement, earning it the nickname \\"Little Jamaica\\". By 2001, roughly 200 families of Rastafarians lived at Shashamane. However, a 2011 fact-finding mission by Steven Golding of the Universal Negro Improvement Association's Kingston branch discovered that there has been ongoing confusion over land title among later migrants, particularly because Ethiopian policy no longer permits the alienation of land to foreign citizens. Furthermore, as Ethiopian nationality law does not incorporate the concept of jus soli, the children of Jamaicans living in Ethiopia are not citizens of the country and cannot access certain public services reserved for citizens. The Jamaican diaspora in Ethiopia have pressed the Jamaican government to establish an embassy in Addis Ababa in order to represent their concerns more effectively to the Ethiopian government; as of 2010, Jamaica was represented in Ethiopia solely by an honorary consul. In 2017, the Rastafarian community were granted identification cards and resident status by the government, although officials were quick to stress that this action did not amount to granting them citizenship.

Nowrasteh is a self-described \\"radical\\" advocate for open borders to and from the United States. He has published a number of peer- reviewed studies on immigration. In January 2013, ABC News listed Nowrasteh as #15 on a list of top 20 immigration experts to follow on Twitter in the United States. In July 2013, The National Journal magazine ran a feature in its print edition about Nowrasteh entitled \\"The Libertarian Case,\\" that featured an interview and discussion of immigration. He has faced criticism from conservatives for his views on immigration and other topics.Jim Geraghty, https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/12/conservatives-political-correctness- alex-nowrasteh-wrong \\"There Is No Right-Wing Equivalent to Political Correctness\\" December 12, 2016Jason Richwine, https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/immigrant-welfare-study-cato-alex- nowrasteh-robert-orr \\"Obfuscating the Immigrant-Welfare Debate\\" May 15, 2018 Early life Alex Nowrasteh was born and raised in Southern California to Iranian American Cyrus Nowrasteh (a filmmaker) and his wife Betsy Giffen Nowrasteh (who has collaborated with Cyrus on some of his film projects). Alex completed a B.A. in economics from George Mason University and a M.Sc. in economic history from the London School of Economics where he authored a dissertation about the economics of counter-insurgency strategy. Publications =Publications related to immigration= In April 2013, Nowrasteh wrote a blog post critical of a 2007 study conducted by Robert Rector and published by the Heritage Foundation that attempted to estimate the long-term fiscal impact of various immigration policies. It delayed the release of Heritage's updated study and placed it under severe scrutiny by academics and other policy analysts ‚Äì substantially diminishing its influence. On the day of the publication of the Heritage report (May 6, 2013), Nowrasteh participated in a press call strongly critiquing the study, along with people from Americans for Tax Reform, the Kemp Foundation, and the American Action Network. On September 13, 2016, the Cato Institute published a Policy Analysis by Nowrasteh on \\"Terrorism and Immigration: A Risk Analysis.\\" He notes that, \\"Terrorism is a hazard to human life and material prosperity that should be addressed in a sensible manner whereby the benefits of actions to contain it outweigh the costs. ... [T]he chance of an American perishing in a terrorist attack on U.S. soil that was committed by a foreigner over the 41-year period studied here is 1 in 3.6 million per year. The hazard posed by foreigners who entered on different visa categories varies considerably. For instance, the chance of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion per year while the chance of being murdered in an attack committed by an illegal immigrant is an astronomical 1 in 10.9 billion per year. By contrast, the chance of being murdered by a tourist on a B visa, the most common tourist visa, is 1 in 3.9 million per year. Any government response to terrorism must take account of the wide range of hazards posed by foreign-born terrorists who entered under various visa categories.\\" Nowrasteh (along with Michelangelo Landgrave) used a residual statistical technique to estimate the number of illegal immigrants who are incarcerated in a Cato report entitled \\"Criminal Immigrants: Their Numbers, Demographics, and Countries of Origin.\\" Their main finding was that \\"[t]he incarceration rate was 1.53 percent for natives, 0.85 percent for illegal immigrants, and 0.47 percent for legal immigrants.\\" Nowrasteh's academic research largely focuses on how immigrants could affect the economic institutions in destination countries. A paper by Nowrasteh on the subject in collaboration with George Mason University doctoral student Zachary Gochenour found that immigration to the United States appeared to have not had a significant impact on the welfare state viewed in either per capita or aggregate terms. The authors summarized their findings and the policy implications in an op-ed for Investors Business Daily. Ilya Somin discussed the policy implications of the research in an article for The Washington Post'. In May 2014, the Cato Institute published a working paper co-authored by Nowrasteh (along with J. R. Clark, Robert Lawson, Benjamin Powell, and Ryan Murphy) on the impact of immigration on institutions. The paper was later published by the journal Public Choice in April 2015. Nowrasteh (along with J.R. Clark, and Benjamin Powell) also authored \\"Does mass immigration destroy institutions? 1990s Israel as a natural experiment\\" in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization. In 2019, Nowrasteh published another study in the Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization which concluded that there was \\"no relationship between immigration and terrorism, whether measured by the number of attacks or victims, in destination countries... These results hold for immigrants from both Muslim majority and conflict-torn countries of origin.\\" =Other publications= Nowrasteh has co-authored two academic papers that appeared in the Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization. The first with Benjamin Powell and Ryan Ford was an analysis of how Somalia's economy functioned in a stateless society. The second was co-authored with Professor Pete Leeson of George Mason University and is about the economics of ransom bonds, a peculiar financial instrument used in piracy during the Napoleonic Wars. Nowrasteh has also co-authored an academic paper on privateers with Alex Tabarrok that appeared in the Fletcher Security Review and another academic paper about the impact of immigration on economic freedom that appeared in the journal Public Choice. The latter had numerous co-authors. A 2019 study by Nowrasteh appeared in The World Bank Economic Review. The study found that the influx of refugees into Jordan during the Gulf War had long-lasting positive effects on Jordanian economic institutions. =Commentary= Nowrasteh has been a blogger/guest contributor for the Huffington Post, for Forbes magazine, and for The Hill.

The earliest work of Japanese history is attributed to Prince Sh≈çtoku, who is said to have written the Tenn≈çki and the Kokki in 620CE. The earliest extant work is the Kojiki of 712. The Nihon Shoki followed by 720. These two works formed the base of a history of the nation based in great part on Japanese mythology, in particular that of the Shinto religion. The works were inspired by Chinese historiography and were compiled with the support of the Japanese state. Five more works between 797 and 901 completed what had begun with the Nihon Shoki; the six are known as the Rikkokushi (\\"six national histories\\"). An abandonment of Chinese inspiration and state support marks the historiographical writings of the period from the 9th to 16th centuries. A great number of historical tales called rekishi monogatari and war tales called gunki monogatari appeared, and works such as the shiky≈ç \\"four mirrors\\" of the 12th to 14th centuries and The Tale of the Heike of 1371 enjoyed widespread popularity. Other art forms such as Noh theatre and emaki scrolls added to these written works. Neo-Confucian schools became preeminent at the beginning of the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868). They brought a methodology very critical of works such as the Kojiki, but did not contradict the Mandate of Heaven. The most prominent representatives of this are the Hayashi clan and the Mitogaku school. The nativist kokugaku school, inspired by Shinto, returned in the 18th century, driven by the work of Motoori Norinaga. It opposed the Neo-Confucians by seeking to demonstrate the veracity of Shinto mythology, especially of the Age of the Gods and the early emperors, whose existence is doubted. Japanese historiography opened to Western influences at the end of the 18th century. Rangaku (\\"Dutch learning\\"), translations of European works in the mid-19th century, and then the introduction of German historiography of Ludwig Riess in 1887 brought new analytical tools to the various Japanese schools of history. During the period of the Empire of Japan (1868‚Äì1947), historians questioned, at the peril of their academic freedom, one of the ideological foundations of the new regime: the place of national myths in the national history. Marxist ideas were introduced in the 1920s and renewed in the post-World War II period with the work of Hisao ≈åtsuka. Themes and research diversified from the 1970s, soon accompanied by a resurgence of conservative and nationalist approaches. Beginnings through the Middle Ages =Earliest chronicles to the Nihon Shoki= The Nihon Shoki of 720, one of the earliest texts tracing the history of Japan The earliest extant works aiming to present the History of Japan appeared in the 8th century CE. The Kojiki of 712 and the Nihon Shoki of 720 looked to similar Chinese models, at a time when Chinese culture had a great influence on Japan. These works were compiled following a decree in 681 from Emperor Tenmu, who sought to set a stable version of what appeared in the Teiki and Ky≈´ji, no longer extant, possibly non-existent works of which numerous contradictory editions were said to have circulated. The Kojiki and Nihon Shoki were compiled by functionaries of the imperial administration and centred on the reigns and deeds of past emperors, seeking to legitimize their actions. The emergence of this type of publication became possible through the strengthening of centralized authority within a strong state. The authors of the Kojiki of 712 trace the first work of this type to 620, when Prince Sh≈çtoku is said to have written the first historical books, the Tenn≈çki and Kokki. The existence of these works is debated, though modern historians trace the first historical writings to the mid-7th century. The form is unknown, but they are likely to have copied Chinese chronicles with Korean influences due to their transmission through the kingdom of Baekje on the Korean Peninsula. The Kojiki was intended essentially for use within the court and is written in a mixture of Classical Chinese and phonetic readings of Chinese characters. It takes Imperial China as its model and depicts the territory of Japan as extending historically to territorial claims as far back as the Korean kingdom of Baekje. Japan is presented as a sovereign country, and China is never mentioned. The writings focus on the Imperial House of Japan and the genealogy of the great families of the court. The Nihon Shoki departs from the form of the Kojiki. It is written entirely in a classical Chinese and designed to be presented to foreign envoys. Unlike the Kojiki, it gives only a small place to the creation myths of Japan, and Chinese writings (such as the Book of Wei and the Book of Jin) and above Koreans are widely cited in it. The chronology of the chronicles of the kingdom of Baekje serves as reference by which to weave Japanese history, and links are also made with Chinese chronology. It also borrows the Chinese idea of the Mandate of Heaven, but differs from it to legitimize the entire Japanese imperial lineage. The Kojiki and Nihon Shoki also differ from Chinese models by including a large number of poems. =Six national histories= In 718 Y≈çr≈ç Code commissioned the Ministry of the Centre to compile a national history; the resulting Nihon Shoki of 720 served as a basis for similar works. Other historical chronicles were published over the following century: the Shoku Nihongi in 797, the Nihon K≈çki in 840, the Shoku Nihon K≈çki in 869, the Nihon Montoku Tenn≈ç Jitsuroku in 871, and the Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku in 901. With the Nihon Shoki, they form the Rikkokushi‚Äîthe \\"six national histories\\". Beginning in the 11th century, in the mid-Heian period, state power weakened, and this sort of great chronicle was abandoned. Their form later served as inspiration during the Edo period of the 17th‚Äì19th centuries, when the sh≈çguns sought to legitimize their power by having historical works of this type written. The writing of the Shoku Nihongi, the first successor to the Nihon Shoki began about 760 by Fujiwara no Nakamaro, but suffered several setbacks before its publication in 797, such as Nakamaro's death in the Fujiwara no Nakamaro Rebellion in 764; the thirty draft volumes drew criticism for concentrating on anecdotal facts and ignoring some major events. Emperor K≈çnin had the project revived, but it still remained in draft form. Edicts in 794 and 797 made it possible to complete the project. The forty volumes of the Shoku Nihongi cover the period from 697 to 791. The final work stands out for its use of new sources, such as Buddhist temple registers or tax revenue reports. Like the Kojiki it is written in a language based on classical Chinese and on a phonetic use of Chinese characters. The Shoku Nihongi also describes certain aspects of Japanese society of the time, such as the conditions of the workers at construction sites in the capital Heij≈ç-ky≈ç (modern Nara). In keeping with Chinese models, the place of poetry is greatly reduced. Emperor Saga had the compilation of the Nihon K≈çki begun in 819, but the project soon came to a stop due to the deaths of several of its coordinators. It was finally completed in 840, its 40 volumes chronicling the period 792 to 833. Biographies of the main figures of the Imperial Court in Kyoto were included at the time of their deaths for the first time. The three following books, the Shoku Nihon K≈çki, the Nihon Montoku Tenn≈ç Jitsuroku, and the Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku, were compiled following the codes established by the earlier three, but focusing on shorter periods: the Shoku Nihon Shoki and Nihon Montoku Tenn≈ç Jitsuroku each focus on a single imperial reign. Seeking still to get closer to Chinese models, they include references to natural disasters. They focus less on the court. The Fujiwara clan, which dominated the court, displayed its power in other genres of writing, such as rekishi monogatari (\\"historical tales\\"). The imperial lineage was sufficiently legitimized by different historical writings and no longer needed to order such works to assert its authority. The closure in 969 of the office charged with writing the next of these works, the Shinkokushi, marked the end of this style. =Historical tales beginning in the 9th century= New forms of historical account flourished from the 11th to 16th centuries. They drew inspiration from court literature such as The Tale of Genji then in fashion among the nobility. In contrast to earlier chronicles, these texts take a more subjective approach, concentrating on narrative to attract the interest of the reader, and were written in Japanese rather than classical Chinese. They focus more on historical figures, in particular in gunki monogatari \\"warrior tales\\". The earliest of these accounts, the Eiga Monogatari, follows the Rikkokushi, as it begins in 887 and completes the Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku. It contains numerous dating errors (about 20% of the dates are incorrect), and many embellishments and fabrications. Four works known together as Shiky≈ç (\\"Four Mirrors\\") were written following this first monogatari. Using the image of the historical mirror used by the Chinese historian Sima Qian in 2nd century, and use a narrator to tell a story through the lives of important characters. The emphasis is still is on the lives of court nobles in the capital. The first three appeared in the 12th century: the ≈åkagami (\\"The Great Mirror\\", 1119), the Imakagami (\\"Today's Mirror\\", 1170), and the Mizukagami (\\"The Water Mirror\\", 1195). The fourth, Masukagami (\\"The Clear Mirror\\"), appeared between 1368 and 1376. and covers Kyoto court life during the Kamakura period (1185‚Äì1333). Gunki monogatari \\"warrior tales\\" were in a style meant to be recited by itinerant monks. The earliest of these is the H≈çgen Monogatari, which deals with the H≈çgen Rebellion of 1156. The Heiji Monogatari followed, describing the Heiji Rebellion of 1159‚Äì1160. Where the former keeps to describing events, the second distills the principles of good governance, inspired by Confucian theory to explain events. The most prominent of this sort of book, the Heike Monogatari, covers the conflicts between the Minamoto and Taira clans. It is deeply influenced by Buddhist themes, but is limited in political analysis. Two of these works aimed at a comprehensive retelling and interpretation of the history of Japan. The Gukansh≈ç of 1220 gave a Buddhist reading of the nation's history, and the Jinn≈ç Sh≈çt≈çki of 1339 a Shinto one. The latter asserts Japan as a country chosen by the gods and thus superior to all others, which has left a lasting influence on Japanese historiography, politics, and nationalism. =Diversification of forms at the end of the Middle Ages= During the Japanese Middle Ages the gunki monogatari remained an important genre of historical narrative. The country underwent numerous periods of civil conflict, such as the Nanboku-ch≈ç (1336‚Äì1392), Sengoku (1467‚Äì1603), and Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period (1573‚Äì1603), driving the popularity of such works. The 15th-century covers the ≈ånin War (1467‚Äì1477) and is one of the major representatives of the style of the period. Two other prominent examples appeared at the beginning of the 17th century, both biographical accounts of military leaders: that of Oda Nobunaga in the Shinch≈ç k≈çki and that of Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the Taik≈çki. Diplomatic history first appeared in Japan in 1470 with the publication of 's which traces the nature of international exchanges between Japan, China, and Korea. The work reproduces many diplomatic documents. The imperial court also produced numerous historical works. For example, Ichij≈ç Kanera published the (\\"Origins of Court Ritual\\"), which traces the main events affecting court society. It refers to the lunar cycle while detailing the origins and development of these events. In 1455‚Äì57 Ichij≈ç also published the , a commentary on the Nihon Shoki, evidencing that the Nihon Shoki formed part of the readings of the nobles of the time. The work of the Shinto priest Yoshida Kanetomo, is also notable, as it shows correspondences between the Japanese calendar and three foreign ones.  History  The process of compiling a written history of Japan began in the seventh century. The most important of the early works are the Rikkokushi or six national histories which were written in the 9th century.Nussbaum, Louis-Fr√©d√©ric. (2005). \\"Rikkokushi\\" in Japan Encyclopedia, pp. 789‚Äì790. The strategies for writing history changed over time. The earliest works were created by Imperial edict. In 1793, the Tokugawa shogunate established the Institute for Japanese Studies (Wagaku K√¥dansho).Historiographical Institute, University of Tokyo, \\"History\\"; retrieved February 1, 2013. In 1869, Emperor Meiji issued an Imperial rescript which explained the importance of historiography: > Historiography is a for ever immortal state ritual (taiten) and a wonderful > act of our ancestors. But after the Six National Histories it was > interrupted and no longer continued .... Now the evil of misrule by the > warriors since the Kamakura period has been overcome and imperial government > has been restored.

Japanese civilization in the > modern world, Vol. 16, p. 47. In 1929, the Meiji period office of historiography was renamed the Historiographical Institute (Shiryo Hensan-jo).  Interpretive models  By the 1960s, Japanese historians were divided between Marxists and Non-Marxists, but they generally agreed on emphasizing the process of modernization as the driving force in Japanese history after 1850. Non-Marxist historians in the United States were specially influential introducing modernization models. However, a younger generation of Japanese scholars in the 1970s rejected modernization models because they supposedly obscured class conflict and the social dynamics of society. By the 1980s, Marxism was in disrepute after the fall of Soviet communism, and more complex versions of multi-dimensional modernization came to be used. This led to scholarly debates over gender roles, living standards, domestic economies, agricultural practices, educational programs, and demographic changes. The line of argument is that modernization was not a single simple trajectory toward social economic and political progress, but it also could have authoritarian and statist outcomes, and in some cases it was led by the militarists.Sheldon Garon, ‚ÄúRethinking modernization and modernity in Japanese history: A focus on state-society relations,‚Äù ‚Äò‚ÄôJournal of Asian Studies‚Äô‚Äô (1994) 53#2 pp 346-366.S√©bastien Conrad, \\"‚ÄòThe Colonial Ties Are Liquidated‚Äô: Modernization Theory, Post-War Japan and the Global Cold War.\\" Past & Present 216.1 (2012): 181-214. The Marxist historians divided in the 1920s and 1930s into two competing schools which debated the nature of Japanese capitalism between the old-line Socialist R≈çn≈ç and the more Stalinist and more influential K≈çza schools. The R≈çn≈ç said the main goal was to nationalize finance and zaibatsu in industry, The K≈çza argued the main goal was to end feudalism in terms of large landowners.Georg G. Iggers, and Harold Talbot Parker, eds. International handbook of historical studies: contemporary research and theory (Taylor & Francis, 1979) pp 253-276. As hard-line Communism weakened following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Marxist historians have increasingly turned away from an emphasis on blue- collar industrial workers and, influenced by French historical theorist Louis Althusser, have focused more on the relationship between power structures and the economy of cultural production. Much of the research looks at late eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Edo.William Johnston, \\"Not quite an uroboros: Theory, power, and popular culture in early modern Japan.\\" History and Theory 54.3 (2015): 441-454. A Marxist history of science emerged in the 1920s when Ogura Kinnosuke, the second president of the History of Science Society of Japan, criticized Japanese science as an imported product that was imitative and superficial, and lacking a social conscience.Shigeru Nakayama, \\"Externalist Approach of Japanese Historians of Science.\\" Japanese Studies in the History of Science (1972), Vol. 11, pp 1‚Äì10.

It was written in 1938 and first published in book form in MacNeice's poetry collection The Earth Compels (1938). The poem recounts an excursion taken by MacNeice from London to Dublin, in order to watch a rugby football match at Lansdowne Road stadium. MacNeice does not specify the occasion, but internal evidence from the poem establishes the match as a rugby football international when England defeated Ireland on 12 February 1938, 36 - 14.History of rugby union matches between England and Ireland Background Louis MacNeice, like his fellow Irish writer Samuel Beckett, took a keen interest in rugby football. MacNeice played rugby while a pupil at Sherborne Preparatory School and Marlborough College, and later enjoyed watching matches involving Ireland.Jon Stallworthy: Louis MacNeice, p. 238. The Irish poet Conor O'Callaghan, reviewing the Collected Poems of Louis MacNeice in Poetry magazine, notes that MacNeice left Ireland for boarding school in England at the age of ten and never lived in Ireland again. \\"However, he always supported Ireland in international rugby matches with England\\".Conor O'Callaghan: His Master's Voice, Poetry magazine. Rugby Football Excursion recounts an excursion taken by MacNeice from London to Dublin, in order to watch a rugby football match at Lansdowne Road stadium. The journey begins by train from Euston railway station: The journey then continues by boat across the Irish Sea on the passenger vessel Hibernia, before arriving in Dublin: (College Park is a cricket ground in the grounds of Trinity College, Dublin.) MacNeice then evokes the atmosphere at Lansdowne Road, where is to be played the rugby football match. MacNeice does not specify the actual occasion, but the details provided in the sixth stanza - \\"Eccentric scoring - Nicholson, Marshall and Unwin, / Replies by Bailey and Daly\\" - establish the match as a rugby football international between Ireland and England in the 1938 Home Nations Championship, played on 12 February 1938. England led 23-0 at half-time but Ireland improved during the second half, managing to score four tries (the last of which was scored by Maurice Daly, making his first and only appearance for Ireland).http://www.cliftonrfchistory.co.uk/internationals/ireland/daly/daly.htm England won the match by 36 points to 14, with tries by (among others) Basil Nicholson, Robert Marshall and Jimmy Unwin. Path√© News made a newsreel of this match.http://www.britishpathe.com/video/rugby-international-ireland-v-england- lner The newsreel shows the English and Irish teams running onto the pitch, watched by a huge crowd, followed by various shots of the match in progress. After the match, as MacNeice recounts, he had \\"tea and toast with Fellows and Bishops\\" in a Regency room overlooking St Stephen's Green, before taking \\"a walk through Dublin down the great / Grey streets broad and straight and drowned in twilight\\". The poem ends with MacNeice leaving Dublin, taking the boat from D√∫n Laoghaire back across the Irish Sea to England. Structure Rugby Football Excursion is a poem of eleven stanzas, each of four lines. The poem does not make use of end rhyme. MacNeice does however make formal use of internal rhyme, rhyming the end of the second line in each stanza with the beginning of the fourth line (\\"Daly/Gaily\\", \\"twilight/High lights\\"). An additional internal rhyme comes in the last stanza, where \\"beery\\" rhymes with D√∫n Laoghaire (pronounced Dunleary). The poem is autobiographical, and is narrated in the first person by Louis MacNeice. Themes The literary critic Samuel Hynes notes how Louis MacNeice \\"commonly presented himself... as a lover of ordinary pleasures\\".London Review of Books, 2 March 1989. Hynes quotes a passage from Zoo (1938), written the same year as Rugby Football Excursion, in which MacNeice describes reacting with delight to (among other things) \\"Moran‚Äôs two classic tries at Twickenham in 1937\\".Louis MacNeice: Zoo, p. 40. Rugby Football Excursion is on one level a poem about the pleasure and excitement of watching a rugby football match: \\"Lansdowne Road - the swirl of faces, flags, / Gilbert and Sullivan music, emerald jerseys...\\" However, the poem also explores MacNeice's ambivalent feelings about Ireland and his Irish heritage, a theme which is present in other poems by MacNeice from this period such as Carrickfergus and Autumn Journal. His walk through Dublin after the match takes him past \\"Statues of poets and Anglo-Irish patriots\\" but also takes in \\"Junkshops, the smell of poverty\\" and \\"street on street of broken / Fanlights over the doors of tenement houses\\".

Early years John Johnson was born in Dublin around 1776. His parents both came from English families that had long settled in Ireland. He apparently attended Trinity College, Dublin and then Trinity College, Cambridge, but did not take a degree from either university. His father died in the spring of 1798. Johnson left Cambridge and on 20 September 1798 joined the 51st infantry regiment as an ensign. He bought a promotion to lieutenant in January 1799, but became bored with the lack of action and sold this position in the autumn of 1800. After leaving the army Johnson added \\"Mordaunt\\" to his name, and spent some time travelling in Europe. He became proficient in several languages, and becoming a friend of the Duke of Brunswick. He came back to England in the spring of 1803, then returned to Dublin, staying there until the autumn of 1804 when he returned to Europe. He spent three more years there, mainly in Germany, renewing his connections with influential people and learning about the political situation. He returned to England, hoping to gain a position with the government, and ran into financial difficulties. Diplomat Johnson wrote A Memoir on the Political State of Europe, intending to publish it. The Prime Minister Spencer Perceval read this work, interviewed Johnson and gave him a position in the Foreign Office as a confidential agent. He undertook several missions on the continent, at that time largely controlled by Napoleon, who was at war with Britain. He was active in the Habsburg territories at a time when normal diplomatic relations had been suspended. Metternich considered that he was the most capable and discreet of the British agents in Germany at that time. When Sweden declared war on Britain on 17 November 1810, announcing its ports were closed to British merchants, Johnson met with Count von Rosen who assured him that the declaration would have little real effect on trade and Sweden had no intention of any act of hostility. After the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1814, bringing temporary peace, Johnson was appointed charg√© d'affaires at Brussels, and then was made British consul at Genoa. He was said to be \\"in close and friendly correspondence with the principal ministers and generals and leading public characters of almost all the states of Europe\\". Johnson became infected with Tuberculosis. He travelled to Florence for the sake of his health, dying there on 10 September 1815 at the age of 39. He was unmarried. He had purchased many rare books from the collection of the Fontecastello monastery at Monte Pulciano, in Tuscany. These went on sale after his death.

The 1890 general election in the Te Aroha electorate had been contested by William Shepherd Allen and William Fraser. Allen was elected, but Fraser mounted a successful election petition, and Allen was disqualified from standing again. The by- election was contested by Fraser and Sir Walter Buller, the well known ornithologist, who both represented the Liberal Party, plus a third candidate who was not taken seriously. Shortly before the election, the Liberal Government made Fraser its official candidate. A candidate representing the opposition pulled out of the contest in late June, as it was clear that only a Liberal Party supporter could win. Fraser won the by-election, obtaining more than 60% of the votes. Background The Te Aroha electorate was first formed for the 11th New Zealand Parliament in 1890. William Shepherd Allen and William Fraser contested the . Allen had a majority of 235 votes and was declared elected. Fraser petitioned against the election on three grounds: that Allen (who at the time of the election was overseas) had not given his consent to being nominated, that scrutineers had not been appointed by Allen in writing, and charges of bribery, corruption and treating of Allen's agents. The case was heard over two and a half days by Chief Justice James Prendergast and by Justice Edward Conolly. They issued their judgement on 3 April 1891, and declared that Allen's nomination was legal, charges of bribery or corruption were not proven, but that T. O. Hammond having been a paid agent of Allen was in violation of the Corrupt Practices Prevention Act, 1881, and the election was thus declared void. There was then legal argument that Fraser should be declared duly elected instead, but Justice Conolly rejected this, stating that it was up to the House of Representatives to decide on that. The judges disqualified Allen from standing in the Te Aroha electorate for 12 months, but he could contest by-elections in other electorates should they arise. Allen regretted that he could not contest the upcoming by-election. Some of his friends decided to petition parliament to have the disqualification overturned. The Public Petition Committee reported to the House on 10 July (i.e. the day after the by-election) and recommended that the Government pass a bill to remove the stigma of disqualification. The following table gives the final 1890 election results: Candidates Various potential candidates were approached by the electors and discussed in the newspapers. Fraser, a supporter of the Liberal Party, confirmed that he would contest the by-election on 15 April, after it had previously been reported that he would not stand again. William Herries of Shaftesbury in the Piako District was asked to become a candidate in April. Joseph Dargaville, who had previously represented the Auckland West electorate, was discussed as a probable candidate, and the potential candidacy of Sir Maurice O'Rorke, who after 29 years in Parliament had been defeated at the 1890 election, was rumoured. The lawyer and ornithologist Walter Buller, who had previously been unsuccessful in the 1876 and s, started canvassing in the electorate as a supporter of the Liberal Government during April. William McCullough, a former Mayor of Thames, was asked in mid June to stand in the upcoming by-election. William Murray, who had until 1881 represented the electorate, was understood to be a candidate for the opposition to the ruling Liberal Government. Dr. Charles Broome of Huntly announced his candidacy in late June, but his nomination was regarded as a \\"joke\\" by the local newspaper, the Thames Star. Lemuel Bagnall was another candidate. He retired from the contest in late June, as the public showed strong support for the government, and that as opposition candidate he would not find sufficient support. Election Nominations were received by 29 June from Fraser, Buller, and Broome. On 1 July, the government decided to make Fraser its official candidate. The by-election was held on 9 July 1891 and was won by Fraser. The following table gives the election results: Fraser represented the electorate until the end of the parliamentary term in 1893, when the electorate was abolished again.

Although she started publishing when she was a teenager, her literary career took off in 1948 when she won a national contest; she went on to be a prolific and award-winning author.Fausta Samaritani, ‚ÄúNel salotto Bellonci nasce una scrittrice,‚Äù Inabruzzo.com, 11/8/2011 The Nobel laureate Eugenio Montale compared her realism to James Joyce‚Äôs Dubliners, and other distinguished critics considered her one of the most important and original voices in Italy‚Äôs post-World War II literature.See the reviews collected by Pietro Zullino in La vita e l'opera di Laudomia Bonanni (Roma: edizione privata, 2002). Biography Laudomia Bonanni was born in 1907 in L‚ÄôAquila, the capital city of the mountainous Abruzzo region of Central Italy, located about 60 miles northeast of Rome. Her parents were Giovanni, a musician turned coal merchant, and Amelia Perilli, a primary school teacher.Gianfranco Giustizieri, \\"Io che ero una donna di domani\\" ‚Äì In viaggio tra gli scritti di Laudomia Bonanni (L‚ÄôAquila: Edizioni del Consiglio Regionale dell'Abruzzo, 2008), p.9. They named her after a character in Niccol√≥ de' Lapi (1841), a historical novel by Massimo D'Azeglio.Sandra Petrignani, Le signore della scrittura (Milano: La Tartaruga, 1984), pp.59-64. Laudomia Bonanni-L'Adultera- Bompiani 1964-copertina dipinto Orneore Metelli After graduating from the Istituto magistrale in 1924, Bonanni taught in several village schools in the mountains around L‚ÄôAquila. She witnessed first-hand the hardships of village life before moving back to L'Aquila in 1930.Gianfranco Giustizieri, \\"Io che ero una donna di domani\\", p.11. In 1927 Bonanni published her first collection of fiction, Storie tragiche della montagna, Novelle d‚ÄôAbruzzo (Tragic Stories from the Mountains: Novellas of the Abruzzo), and some children's books. She continued to publish stories regularly and some collected works, but did not win national award recognition for her work until the post-World War II years. In 1927 Bonanni also started working for literary magazines and newspapers. She continued to work in journalism until 1983, publishing more than 1,300 articles.Gianfranco Giustizieri interviewed by Goffredo Palmerini in Laudomia Bonanni, una scrittrice senza tempo, Abruzzo24ore.com, 9/15/2010. She offered an extraordinary overview of contemporary society that displayed uncommon sensitivity to the problems of the lower classes. These writings reveal the extensive experience she gained over the years working as a consultant in the Juvenile Court in L‚ÄôAquila, where she served as a lay judge for nearly 20 years, between 1946-1964.Gianfranco Giustizieri, Laudomia scrittrice senza tempo ‚Äì Secondo viaggio tra gli scritti di Laudomia Bonanni (Lanciano: Carabba, 2010), p.38.  Literary works  Bonanni‚Äôs literary works revolve around two main themes: one sociopolitical (focused on the marginalized and the oppressed in society) and a more introspective one (exploring the contradictions of bourgeois morality). The radical nature of her investigation gives Bonanni a unique and original style that distinguishes her voice from other twentieth-century writers.Pietro Zullino, ‚ÄúLaudomia Bonanni, detta La penna dell‚ÄôAquila,‚Äù Repubblicaletteraria.net She also explored \\"the loss of childhood innocence; the Italian veneration of, and ambivalence toward, the power of maternity; the intricacy of human bonds in even the smallest of communities; the struggle against contingency in the poor mountain region that was her birthplace.\\"Introduction, Laudomia Bonanni, The Reprisal, University of Chicago Press, 2013 With two short stories gathered under the title Il fosso (The Ditch), in 1948 Laudomia Bonanni won a national literary contest for an unpublished work, sponsored by the Amici della Domenica, a Rome literary salon. It was hosted by the distinguished critic Goffredo Bellonci. Her work was selected by a committee that included prominent members of the contemporary Italian cultural elite.See Maria Bellonci, Come ti racconto gli anni del Premio Strega (Milano: Club degli Editori, 1969). Poet and critic Eugenio Montale wrote of her two stories that won the contest: \\"...this Laudomia truly deserves to be brought out from the shadows. She reveals a narrative strength that must not conclude here. She is sure to go a long way.\\"Laudomia Bonanni, The Reprisal, back cover, University of Chicago Press, 2013 With the addition of the stories, \\"Funeral Mass\\" and \\"The Seed,\\" a collection of four stories was published in 1949 as Il fosso by the prestigious press Mondadori. The following year Il fosso won another prize, the Premio Bagutta Opera Prima for a first-book: this was the first time such a prize was awarded to a woman.Fausta Samaritani, ‚ÄúNel salotto Bellonci nasce una scrittrice,‚Äù Inabruzzo.com, 11/8/2011. Bonanni received critical acclaim; among her greatest admirers were prominent literary critics such as Emilio Cecchi, Giuseppe de Robertis, and Enrico Falqui.Pietro Zullino, La vita e l'opera di Laudomia Bonanni. In 1954 Laudomia Bonanni‚Äôs Palma e sorelle (Palma and Sisters) won the Premio Soroptimist. Her next novels, L‚Äôimputata (The Accused) and L‚Äôadultera (The Adulteress), both published with Bompiani, received two important literary awards, respectively the Premio Viareggio (1960) and the Premio Selezione Campiello (1964). Both works were translated into French and Spanish.Gianfranco Giustizieri, Laudomia scrittrice senza tempo, pp.205-208. In 1966 Boanni retired from teaching, eventually moving to Rome where she planned to join the literary circles like the Salotto Bellonci. But interest in her work faded, and she withdrew into depression and solitary isolation.See Bonanni‚Äôs letters to Maria Bellonci in Fausta Samaritani (ed.), Epistolario (Lanciano: Carabba, 2006). After a long silence, in the late 1970s she published \\"Citt√† del tabacco\\" (\\"Tobacco City\\", 1977), followed by two novels: Il bambino di pietra (The Stone Baby, 1979) and Le droghe (The Drugs, 1982). She also collected the short stories inspired by her experiences in the Juvenile Court, publishing them as Vietato ai minori (Forbidden to Minors, 1974). Bonanni was a finalist for the Strega Prize three times (in 1960, 1974, and 1979). She completed La rappresaglia, (The Reprisal) in 1985. When the publisher Bompiani asked her to revise her last manuscript, she refused and retired into solitude.Cesare de Matteis, Introduzione, in Laudomia Bonanni, La rappresaglia (L‚ÄôAquila: Textus, 2003), p.xxx; Gianfranco Giustizieri, \\"Io che ero una donna di domani,\\" p. 29. Bonanni died at 94, almost forgotten. The posthumous publication of La rappresaglia (The Reprisal) (by Textus, L‚ÄôAquila, in 2003) attracted attention, as it dealt with World War II resistance and partisans in Abruzzo, framed within a highly structured narrative. Bonanni may have written most of the novel decades earlier, and revised it over a long period. \\"That extended, ambiguous gestation period and the equally ambiguous but suggestive correlations between the novel and Bonanni‚Äôs own experience in the Second World War\\" have added to in it.Steve Himmer, \\"Review of 'The Reprisal' by Laudomia Bonanni\\", Tri-Quarterly, Issue 144, Summer/Fall 2013, accessed 4 September 2014 At the same time, Il fosso and L‚Äôimputata were reprinted, and scholarly interest in her works has revived, including new perspectives from feminism and postwar literature. The Reprisal is the first of Bonanni's works to be translated into English; it was published in the United States by the University of Chicago Press in 2013. According to reviewer Steve Himmer, its \\"uncomfortable, unresolvable balance makes The Reprisal a challenging, bleak, and haunting read‚Äîand a vital one.\\" Laudomia Bonann, La rappresaglia, Master University Roma Tre, 2004 Legacy and honors *1948, won a national literary contest for an unpublished work; awarded by the Amici della Domenica, with publication of her Il fosso, a collection of four stories, in 1949 *1950, won the Premio Bagutta Opera Prima for Il fosso *1954, won the Premio Soroptimist for her first novel, Palma e sorelle (Palma and Sisters) *1960, won the Premio Viareggio for L'imputata *1964, won the Premio Selezione Campiello for L'adultera *Finalist for the Strega Prize in 1960, 1974, and 1979.

Public debt $ and %GDP (2010) for selected European countries Government debt of Eurozone, Germany and crisis countries compared to Eurozone GDP The European sovereign debt crisis resulted from a combination of complex factors, including the globalization of finance; easy credit conditions during the 2002‚Äì2008 period that encouraged high-risk lending and borrowing practices; the 2007‚Äì2012 global financial crisis; international trade imbalances; real-estate bubbles that have since burst; the 2008‚Äì2012 global recession; fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses; and approaches used by nations to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socializing losses. One narrative describing the causes of the crisis begins with the significant increase in savings available for investment during the 2000‚Äì2007 period when the global pool of fixed-income securities increased from approximately $36 trillion in 2000 to $70 trillion by 2007. This \\"Giant Pool of Money\\" increased as savings from high-growth developing nations entered global capital markets. Investors searching for higher yields than those offered by U.S. Treasury bonds sought alternatives globally. The temptation offered by such readily available savings overwhelmed the policy and regulatory control mechanisms in country after country, as lenders and borrowers put these savings to use, generating bubble after bubble across the globe. While these bubbles have burst, causing asset prices (e.g., housing and commercial property) to decline, the liabilities owed to global investors remain at full price, generating questions regarding the solvency of governments and their banking systems. How each European country involved in this crisis borrowed and invested the money varies. For example, Ireland's banks lent the money to property developers, generating a massive property bubble. When the bubble burst, Ireland's government and taxpayers assumed private debts. In Greece, the government increased its commitments to public workers in the form of extremely generous wage and pension benefits, with the former doubling in real terms over 10 years. Iceland's banking system grew enormously, creating debts to global investors (external debts) several times GDP. The three crucial problems of the European economic governance emerged during the crisis are the asymmetry in the policy-making process for centralized policies and decentralized ones, ambiguities related to the coherent functioning of the euro area and the EU as well as of distribution of powers between national institutions and supranational ones, which implies the dilemma of legitimacy of the European economic governance and its rules. The interconnection in the global financial system means that if one nation defaults on its sovereign debt or enters into recession putting some of the external private debt at risk, the banking systems of creditor nations face losses. For example, in October 2011, Italian borrowers owed French banks $366 billion (net). Should Italy be unable to finance itself, the French banking system and economy could come under significant pressure, which in turn would affect France's creditors and so on. This is referred to as financial contagion. Another factor contributing to interconnection is the concept of debt protection. Institutions entered into contracts called credit default swaps (CDS) that result in payment should default occur on a particular debt instrument (including government issued bonds). But, since multiple CDSs can be purchased on the same security, it is unclear what exposure each country's banking system now has to CDS. Greece hid its growing debt and deceived EU officials with the help of derivatives designed by major banks. Although some financial institutions clearly profited from the growing Greek government debt in the short run, there was a long lead-up to the crisis. EU emergency measures =European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF)= On 9 May 2010, the 27 EU member states agreed to create the European Financial Stability Facility, a legal instrument The EFSF, \\"a legal instrument agreed by finance ministers earlier this month following the risk of Greece's debt crisis spreading to other weak economies.\\" aiming at preserving financial stability in Europe by providing financial assistance to eurozone states in difficulty. The EFSF can issue bonds or other debt instruments on the market with the support of the German Debt Management Office to raise the funds needed to provide loans to eurozone countries in financial troubles, recapitalize banks or buy sovereign debt. Emissions of bonds are backed by guarantees given by the euro area member states in proportion to their share in the paid-up capital of the European Central Bank. The ‚Ç¨440 billion lending capacity of the facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by the eurozone countries' governments and may be combined with loans up to ‚Ç¨60 billion from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (reliant on funds raised by the European Commission using the EU budget as collateral) and up to ‚Ç¨250 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to obtain a financial safety net up to ‚Ç¨750 billion.Europeanvoice.com \\"Media reports said that Spain would ask for support from two EU funds for eurozone governments in financial difficulty: a ‚Ç¨60bn 'European financial stabilisation mechanism', which is reliant on guarantees from the EU budget.\\" The EFSF issued ‚Ç¨5 billion of five-year bonds in its inaugural benchmark issue 25 January 2011, attracting an order book of ‚Ç¨44.5 billion. This amount is a record for any sovereign bond in Europe, and ‚Ç¨24.5 billion more than the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), a separate European Union funding vehicle, with a ‚Ç¨5 billion issue in the first week of January 2011. On 29 November 2011, the member state finance ministers agreed to expand the EFSF by creating certificates that could guarantee up to 30% of new issues from troubled euro-area governments, and to create investment vehicles that would boost the EFSF‚Äôs firepower to intervene in primary and secondary bond markets. Reception by financial markets Stocks surged worldwide after the EU announced the EFSF's creation. The facility eased fears that the Greek debt crisis would spread, and this led to some stocks rising to the highest level in a year or more. The euro made its biggest gain in 18 months, before falling to a new four-year low a week later. Shortly after the euro rose again as hedge funds and other short-term traders unwound short positions and carry trades in the currency. Commodity prices also rose following the announcement. The dollar Libor held at a nine-month high. Default swaps also fell. The VIX closed down a record almost 30%, after a record weekly rise the preceding week that prompted the bailout. The agreement is interpreted as allowing the ECB to start buying government debt from the secondary market which is expected to reduce bond yields. As a result, Greek bond yields fell sharply from over 10% to just over 5%. Asian bonds yields also fell with the EU bailout. Usage of EFSF funds The EFSF only raises funds after an aid request is made by a country. As of the end of July 2012, it has been activated various times. In November 2010, it financed of the total rescue package for Ireland (the rest was loaned from individual European countries, the European Commission and the IMF). In May 2011 it contributed one third of the ‚Ç¨78 billion package for Portugal. As part of the second bailout for Greece, the loan was shifted to the EFSF, amounting to (130bn new package plus 34.4bn remaining from Greek Loan Facility) throughout 2014. On 20 July 2012, European finance ministers sanctioned the first tranche of a partial bail-out worth up to ‚Ç¨100 billion for Spanish banks. This leaves the EFSF with or an equivalent of in leveraged firepower. The EFSF is set to expire in 2013, running some months parallel to the permanent rescue funding program called the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which will start operating as soon as member states representing 90% of the capital commitments have ratified it. (see section: ESM) On 13 January 2012, Standard & Poor‚Äôs downgraded France and Austria from AAA rating, lowered Spain, Italy (and five otherGibson, Kate, \\"S&P; takes Europe's rescue fund down a notch\\", MarketWatch, 16 January 2012 2:37 pm EST. Retrieved 16 January 2012.) euro members further, and maintained the top credit rating for Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands; shortly after, S&P; also downgraded the EFSF from AAA to AA+.Standard & Poor's Ratings Services quoted at =European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM)= On 5 January 2011, the European Union created the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), an emergency funding programme reliant upon funds raised on the financial markets and guaranteed by the European Commission using the budget of the European Union as collateral. It runs under the supervision of the Commission and aims at preserving financial stability in Europe by providing financial assistance to EU member states in economic difficulty. The Commission fund, backed by all 27 European Union members, has the authority to raise up to and is rated AAA by Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's. Under the EFSM, the EU successfully placed in the capital markets a issue of bonds as part of the financial support package agreed for Ireland, at a borrowing cost for the EFSM of 2.59%. Like the EFSF, the EFSM was replaced by the permanent rescue funding programme ESM, which was launched in September 2012. =Brussels agreement and aftermath= On 26 October 2011, leaders of the 17 eurozone countries met in Brussels and agreed on a 50% write-off of Greek sovereign debt held by banks, a fourfold increase (to about ‚Ç¨1 trillion) in bail-out funds held under the European Financial Stability Facility, an increased mandatory level of 9% for bank capitalisation within the EU and a set of commitments from Italy to take measures to reduce its national debt. Also pledged was in \\"credit enhancement\\" to mitigate losses likely to be suffered by European banks. Jos√© Manuel Barroso characterised the package as a set of \\"exceptional measures for exceptional times\\". The package's acceptance was put into doubt on 31 October when Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou announced that a referendum would be held so that the Greek people would have the final say on the bailout, upsetting financial markets. On 3 November 2011 the promised Greek referendum on the bailout package was withdrawn by Prime Minister Papandreou. In late 2011, Landon Thomas in the New York Times noted that some, at least, European banks were maintaining high dividend payout rates and none were getting capital injections from their governments even while being required to improve capital ratios. Thomas quoted Richard Koo, an economist based in Japan, an expert on that country's banking crisis, and specialist in balance sheet recessions, as saying: > I do not think Europeans understand the implications of a systemic banking > crisis.... When all banks are forced to raise capital at the same time, the > result is going to be even weaker banks and an even longer recession ‚Äì if > not depression.... Government intervention should be the first resort, not > the last resort. Beyond equity issuance and debt-to-equity conversion, then, one analyst \\"said that as banks find it more difficult to raise funds, they will move faster to cut down on loans and unload lagging assets\\" as they work to improve capital ratios. This latter contraction of balance sheets \\"could lead to a depression\\", the analyst said.Thomas, Landon, Jr., \\"Banks Retrench in Europe While Keeping Up Appearances\\" (limited no-charge access), The New York Times, 22 December 2011.

Retrieved 21 December 2011. Final agreement on the second bailout package In a marathon meeting on 20/21 February 2012 the Eurogroup agreed with the IMF and the Institute of International Finance on the final conditions of the second bailout package worth ‚Ç¨130 billion. The lenders agreed to increase the nominal haircut from 50% to 53.5%. EU Member States agreed to an additional retroactive lowering of the interest rates of the Greek Loan Facility to a level of just 150 basis points above the Euribor. Furthermore, governments of Member States where central banks currently hold Greek government bonds in their investment portfolio commit to pass on to Greece an amount equal to any future income until 2020. Altogether this should bring down Greece's debt to between 117% and 120.5% of GDP by 2020. European Central Bank ECB Securities Markets Program (SMP) covering bond purchases since May 2010 The European Central Bank (ECB) has taken a series of measures aimed at reducing volatility in the financial markets and at improving liquidity. In May 2010 it took the following actions: * It began open market operations buying government and private debt securities, reaching in February 2012, though it simultaneously absorbed the same amount of liquidity to prevent a rise in inflation. According to Rabobank economist Elwin de Groot, there is a \\"natural limit\\" of the ECB can sterilize. * It reactivated the dollar swap lines with Federal Reserve support. * It changed its policy regarding the necessary credit rating for loan deposits, accepting as collateral all outstanding and new debt instruments issued or guaranteed by the Greek government, regardless of the nation's credit rating. The move took some pressure off Greek government bonds, which had just been downgraded to junk status, making it difficult for the government to raise money on capital markets. On 30 November 2011, the ECB, the U.S. Federal Reserve, the central banks of Canada, Japan, Britain and the Swiss National Bank provided global financial markets with additional liquidity to ward off the debt crisis and to support the real economy. The central banks agreed to lower the cost of dollar currency swaps by 50 basis points to come into effect on 5 December 2011. They also agreed to provide each other with abundant liquidity to make sure that commercial banks stay liquid in other currencies. =Long Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO)= Though the ECB's main refinancing operations (MRO) are from repo auctions with a (bi)weekly maturity and monthly maturation, the ECB now conducts Long Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs), maturing after three months, six months, 12 months and 36 months. In 2003, refinancing via LTROs amounted to 45 bln euro which is about 20% of overall liquidity provided by the ECB. The ECB's first supplementary longer-term refinancing operation (LTRO) with a six-month maturity was announced March 2008. Previously the longest tender offered was three months. It announced two 3-month and one 6-month full allotment of Long Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs). The first tender was settled 3 April, and was more than four times oversubscribed. The ‚Ç¨25 billion auction drew bids amounting to ‚Ç¨103.1 billion, from 177 banks. Another six-month tender was allotted on 9 July, again to the amount of ‚Ç¨25 billion. The first 12-month LTRO in June 2009 had close to 1100 bidders. On 22 December 2011, the ECB started the biggest infusion of credit into the European banking system in the euro's 13-year history. Under its Long Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs) it loaned to 523 banks for an exceptionally long period of three years at a rate of just one percent. Previous refinancing operations matured after three, six and twelve months. The by far biggest amount of was tapped by banks in Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain. This way the ECB tried to make sure that banks have enough cash to pay off of their own maturing debts in the first three months of 2012, and at the same time keep operating and loaning to businesses so that a credit crunch does not choke off economic growth. It also hoped that banks would use some of the money to buy government bonds, effectively easing the debt crisis. On 29 February 2012, the ECB held a second auction, LTRO2, providing 800 Eurozone banks with further in cheap loans. Net new borrowing under the ‚Ç¨529.5 billion February auction was around ‚Ç¨313 billion; out of a total of ‚Ç¨256 billion existing ECB lending (MRO + 3m&6m LTROs), ‚Ç¨215 billion was rolled into LTRO2. ECB lending has largely replaced inter-bank lending. Spain has ‚Ç¨365 billion and Italy has ‚Ç¨281 billion of borrowings from the ECB (June 2012 data). Germany has ‚Ç¨275 billion on deposit. =Resignations= In September 2011, J√ºrgen Stark became the second German after Axel A. Weber to resign from the ECB Governing Council in 2011. Weber, the former Deutsche Bundesbank president, was once thought to be a likely successor to Jean-Claude Trichet as bank president. He and Stark were both thought to have resigned due to \\"unhappiness with the ECB‚Äôs bond purchases, which critics say erode the bank‚Äôs independence\\". Stark was \\"probably the most hawkish\\" member of the council when he resigned. Weber was replaced by his Bundesbank successor Jens Weidmann, while Belgium's Peter Praet took Stark's original position, heading the ECB's economics department. =Money supply growth= In April, 2012, statistics showed a growth trend in the M1 \\"core\\" money supply. Having fallen from an over 9% growth rate in mid-2008 to negative 1% +/- for several months in 2011, M1 core has built to a 2-3% range in early 2012. \\"'It is still early days but a further recovery in peripheral real M1 would suggest an end to recessions by late 2012,' said Simon Ward from Henderson Global Investors who collects the data.\\" While attributing the money supply growth to ECB's LTRO policies, an analysis in The Telegraph said lending \\"continued to fall across the eurozone in March [and] ...

Other economic reforms promoting European growth and employment were also proposed. =Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs)= On 6 September 2012, the ECB announced to offer additional financial support in the form of some yield- lowering bond purchases (OMT), for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout program from EFSF/ESM.\\"Technical features of Outright Monetary Transactions\\", ECB Press Release, 6 September 2012 A eurozone country can benefit from the program if ‚Äì and for as long as ‚Äì it is found to suffer from stressed bond yields at excessive levels; but only at the point of time where the country possesses/regains a complete market access ‚Äì and only if the country still comply with all terms in the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement. Countries receiving a precautionary programme rather than a sovereign bailout, will per definition have complete market access and thus qualify for OMT support if also suffering from stressed interest rates on its government bonds. In regards of countries receiving a sovereign bailout (Ireland, Portugal and Greece), they will on the other hand not qualify for OMT support before they have regained complete market access, which will normally only happen after having received the last scheduled bailout disbursement. Despite none OMT programmes were ready to start in September/October, the financial markets straight away took notice of the additionally planned OMT packages from ECB, and started slowly to price-in a decline of both short-term and long-term interest rates in all European countries previously suffering from stressed and elevated interest levels (as OMTs were regarded as an extra potential back-stop to counter the frozen liquidity and highly stressed rates; and just the knowledge about their potential existence in the very near future helped to calm the markets). If Spain signs a negotiated Memorandum of Understanding with the Troika (EC, ECB and IMF) outlining ESM shall offer a precautionary programme with credit lines for the Spanish government to potentially draw on if needed (beside of the bank recapitalisation package they already applied for), this would qualify Spain also to receive the OMT support from ECB, as the sovereign state would still continue to operate with a complete market access with the precautionary conditioned credit line. In regards of Ireland, Portugal and Greece, they on the other hand have not yet regained complete market access, and thus do not yet qualify for OMT support. European Stability Mechanism (ESM) The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is a permanent rescue funding programme to succeed the temporary European Financial Stability Facility and European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism in July 2012 but it had to be postponed until after the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany had confirmed the legality of the measures on 12 September 2012. The permanent bailout fund entered into force for 16 signatories on 27 September 2012. It became effective in Estonia on 4 October 2012 after the completion of their ratification process. On 16 December 2010 the European Council agreed a two line amendment to the EU Lisbon Treaty to allow for a permanent bail-out mechanism to be establishedEUROPEAN COUNCIL 16‚Äì17 December 2010 CONCLUSIONS, European Council 17 December 2010 including stronger sanctions.

Source Data: Eurostat. In March 2011 a new reform of the Stability and Growth Pact was initiated, aiming at straightening the rules by adopting an automatic procedure for imposing of penalties in case of breaches of either the 3% deficit or the 60% debt rules. By the end of the year, Germany, France and some other smaller EU countries went a step further and vowed to create a fiscal union across the eurozone with strict and enforceable fiscal rules and automatic penalties embedded in the EU treaties. On 9 December 2011 at the European Council meeting, all 17 members of the eurozone and six countries that aspire to join agreed on a new intergovernmental treaty to put strict caps on government spending and borrowing, with penalties for those countries who violate the limits. All other non-eurozone countries apart from the UK are also prepared to join in, subject to parliamentary vote. The treaty will enter into force on 1 January 2013, if by that time 12 members of the euro area have ratified it. Originally EU leaders planned to change existing EU treaties but this was blocked by British prime minister David Cameron, who demanded that the City of London be excluded from future financial regulations, including the proposed EU financial transaction tax. By the end of the day, 26 countries had agreed to the plan, leaving the United Kingdom as the only country not willing to join. Cameron subsequently conceded that his action had failed to secure any safeguards for the UK.End of the veto honeymoon? Cameron on backfoot over euro policy Politics.co.uk, Ian Dunt, Friday, 6 January 2012 Britain's refusal to be part of the fiscal compact to safeguard the eurozone constituted a de facto refusal (PM David Cameron vetoed the project) to engage in any radical revision of the Lisbon Treaty.

In 1885 he was one of the founding members of the Evangelical Mission Covenant Church.Twice-Born Hymns by J. Irving Erickson, (Chicago: Covenant Press, 1976) pp. 98-99. Biography J. A. Hultman was born in 1861 on a farm in J√∂nk√∂ping County in the province of Sm√•land. His family emigrated to America in 1869 and settled on a farm near Essex, Iowa. His religious faith and interest in music began at early age. As a young man he studied for two years at the Chicago Athenaeum while leading a choir at the present-day Douglas Park Covenant Church. He later served as pastor at Covenant churches in Nebraska and Massachusetts. A revivalist preacher while still in his teens, Hultman did not become an ordained minister until 1900. After six years as an assistant pastor in Worcester, Massachusetts, he resigned his post to allow more time for his concert tours and business activities. One of his ventures was the Hultman Conservatory of Music, which he and his son operated in Worcester, Massachusetts and later moved to Chicago. His warm personality and uplifting songs earned Hultman the title of \\"The Sunshine Singer\\". In 1889 he joined the Swedish theologian P. P. Waldenstr√∂m on a preaching tour of the United States, for which he provided the music. He toured extensively, becoming well known in Swedish-American communities and in Sweden, which from 1909 onwards he visited frequently. Wherever he went, he brought along his trademark portable organ. When suspected of being a bootlegger during Prohibition, he was asked if he carried any \\"moonshine\\". He replied that he only smuggled \\"sunshine\\".From Sweden To America (Stockholm: Caprice Records, 1981). Typically, a third of the proceeds from his concerts went to the sponsoring church while another third went to charity. Hultman was quite generous with the third that he received. The 1925 construction of Caroline Hall at North Park University, for instance, was partially funded by his concert earnings. His connection to the school went back to the years 1896-1897 when he had served on the music faculty there. J. A. Hultman was married twice. He and his first wife, Carolina, had four children. The couple met in Chicago, raised a family and for many years collaborated in his musical ministry. Carolina Hultman died in 1919 during a visit to Sweden. Hultman met his second wife, Margaret, while on one of his American tours. He continued working as an evangelist until his death in 1942. Songbooks Hultman published three collections of hymns: Cymbalen (The Cymbal),Cymbalen by J. A. Hultman, (Chicago: Missions-M√§nnens Expedition, 1885). Jubelklangen (The Sound of Jubilation) Jubelklangen by J. A. Hultman and A. L. Skoog, (Minneapolis: Skoog and DeLander), 1896). and Solskenss√•nger (Sunshine Songs).Solskenss√•nger by J. A.

He also contributed to Sions Basun (Zion's Trumpet),Sions Basun (Chicago: Svenska evangeliska missionsf√∂rbundet i Amerika, 1909). the first official hymnal of Covenant Church. He composed the music for countless hymns, including Tack min Gud, f√∂r vad som varit (Thanks my God for all that has been), which in one English version begins: :Thanks my God for all that has been, :Thanks for all that you bestow. :Thanks for all the years that have been, :Thanks for minutes as they flow. :Thanks for spring days, warm with sunshine, :Thanks for fall days, dark and drear. :Thanks for tears, forgotten oft time, :Thanks for peace, my heart to cheer.Hymns and Poems of Sweden (Jamestown, NY: E.

Public debt $ and %GDP (2010) for selected European countries Government debt of Eurozone, Germany and crisis countries compared to Eurozone GDP The European sovereign debt crisis resulted from a combination of complex factors, including the globalization of finance; easy credit conditions during the 2002‚Äì2008 period that encouraged high-risk lending and borrowing practices; the 2007‚Äì2012 global financial crisis; international trade imbalances; real-estate bubbles that have since burst; the 2008‚Äì2012 global recession; fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses; and approaches used by nations to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socializing losses. One narrative describing the causes of the crisis begins with the significant increase in savings available for investment during the 2000‚Äì2007 period when the global pool of fixed-income securities increased from approximately $36 trillion in 2000 to $70 trillion by 2007. This \\"Giant Pool of Money\\" increased as savings from high-growth developing nations entered global capital markets. Investors searching for higher yields than those offered by U.S. Treasury bonds sought alternatives globally. The temptation offered by such readily available savings overwhelmed the policy and regulatory control mechanisms in country after country, as lenders and borrowers put these savings to use, generating bubble after bubble across the globe. While these bubbles have burst, causing asset prices (e.g., housing and commercial property) to decline, the liabilities owed to global investors remain at full price, generating questions regarding the solvency of governments and their banking systems. How each European country involved in this crisis borrowed and invested the money varies. For example, Ireland's banks lent the money to property developers, generating a massive property bubble. When the bubble burst, Ireland's government and taxpayers assumed private debts. In Greece, the government increased its commitments to public workers in the form of extremely generous wage and pension benefits, with the former doubling in real terms over 10 years. Iceland's banking system grew enormously, creating debts to global investors (external debts) several times GDP. The interconnection in the global financial system means that if one nation defaults on its sovereign debt or enters into recession putting some of the external private debt at risk, the banking systems of creditor nations face losses. For example, in October 2011, Italian borrowers owed French banks $366 billion (net). Should Italy be unable to finance itself, the French banking system and economy could come under significant pressure, which in turn would affect France's creditors and so on. This is referred to as financial contagion. Another factor contributing to interconnection is the concept of debt protection. Institutions entered into contracts called credit default swaps (CDS) that result in payment should default occur on a particular debt instrument (including government issued bonds). But, since multiple CDSs can be purchased on the same security, it is unclear what exposure each country's banking system now has to CDS. Greece hid its growing debt and deceived EU officials with the help of derivatives designed by major banks. Although some financial institutions clearly profited from the growing Greek government debt in the short run, there was a long lead-up to the crisis. Direct loans to banks and banking regulation On 28 June 2012 Eurozone leaders agreed to permit loans by the European Stability Mechanism to be made directly to stressed banks rather than through Eurozone states, to avoid adding to sovereign debt. The reform was linked to plans for banking regulation by the European Central Bank. The reform was immediately reflected by a reduction in yield of long-term bonds issued by member states such as Italy and Spain and a rise in value of the Euro. Less austerity, more investment There has been substantial criticism over the austerity measures implemented by most European nations to counter this debt crisis. US economist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman argues that an abrupt return to \\"'non- Keynesian' financial policies\\" is not a viable solution Pointing at historical evidence, he predicts that deflationary policies now being imposed on countries such as Greece and Spain will prolong and deepen their recessions. Together with over 9,000 signatories of \\"A Manifesto for Economic Sense\\" Krugman also dismissed the belief of austerity focusing policy makers such as EU economic commissioner Olli Rehn and most European finance ministers that \\"budget consolidation\\" revives confidence in financial markets over the longer haul. In a 2003 study that analyzed 133 IMF austerity programmes, the IMF's independent evaluation office found that policy makers consistently underestimated the disastrous effects of rigid spending cuts on economic growth.International Monetary Fund: Independent Evaluation Office, Fiscal Adjustment in IMF-supported Programs (Washington, D.C.: International Monetary Fund, 2003); see for example page vii. In early 2012 an IMF official, who negotiated Greek austerity measures, admitted that spending cuts were harming Greece. In October 2012, the IMF said that its forecasts for countries which implemented austerity programs have been consistently overoptimistic, suggesting that tax hikes and spending cuts have been doing more damage than expected, and countries which implemented fiscal stimulus, such as Germany and Austria, did better than expected.Brad Plumer (12 October 2012) \\"IMF: Austerity is much worse for the economy than we thought\\" The Washington Post Despite years of draconian austerity measures Greece has failed to reach a balanced budget as public revenues remain low. According to Keynesian economists \\"growth-friendly austerity\\" relies on the false argument that public cuts would be compensated for by more spending from consumers and businesses, a theoretical claim that has not materialized. The case of Greece shows that excessive levels of private indebtedness and a collapse of public confidence (over 90% of Greeks fear unemployment, poverty and the closure of businesses) led the private sector to decrease spending in an attempt to save up for rainy days ahead. This led to even lower demand for both products and labor, which further deepened the recession and made it ever more difficult to generate tax revenues and fight public indebtedness.Kapoor, Sony, and Peter Bofinger: \\"Europe can't cut and grow\\", The Guardian, 6 February 2012. According to Financial Times chief economics commentator Martin Wolf, \\"structural tightening does deliver actual tightening. But its impact is much less than one to one. A one percentage point reduction in the structural deficit delivers a 0.67 percentage point improvement in the actual fiscal deficit.\\" This means that Ireland e.g. would require structural fiscal tightening of more than 12% to eliminate its 2012 actual fiscal deficit, a task that is difficult to achieve without an exogenous eurozone-wide economic boom. Austerity is bound to fail if it relies largely on tax increases instead of cuts in government expenditures coupled with encouraging \\"private investment and risk-taking, labor mobility and flexibility, an end to price controls, tax rates that encouraged capital formation ...\\" as Germany has done in the decade before the crisis. According to the Europlus Monitor Report 2012, no country should tighten its fiscal reins by more than 2% of GDP in one year, in order to avoid recession. Instead of public austerity, a \\"growth compact\\" centering on tax increases and deficit spending is proposed. Since struggling European countries lack the funds to engage in deficit spending, German economist and member of the German Council of Economic Experts Peter Bofinger and Sony Kapoor of the global think tank Re-Define suggest providing in additional funds to the European Investment Bank (EIB), which could then lend ten times that amount to the employment-intensive smaller business sector. The EU is currently planning a possible increase in the EIB's capital base. Furthermore, the two suggest financing additional public investments by growth-friendly taxes on \\"property, land, wealth, carbon emissions and the under-taxed financial sector\\". They also called on EU countries to renegotiate the EU savings tax directive and to sign an agreement to help each other crack down on tax evasion and avoidance. Currently authorities capture less than 1% in annual tax revenue on untaxed wealth transferred between EU members. According to the Tax Justice Network, worldwide, a global super-rich elite had between $21 and $32 trillion (up to 26,000bn Euros) hidden in secret tax havens by the end of 2010, resulting in a tax deficit of up to $280bn. Apart from arguments over whether or not austerity, rather than increased or frozen spending, is a macroeconomic solution,Vendola, Nichi, \\"Italian debt: Austerity economics? That's dead wrong for us\\", The Guardian, 13 July 2011. union leaders have also argued that the working population is being unjustly held responsible for the economic mismanagement errors of economists, investors, and bankers. Over 23 million EU workers have become unemployed as a consequence of the global economic crisis of 2007‚Äì2010, and this has led many to call for additional regulation of the banking sector across not only Europe, but the entire world. In the turmoil of the Global Financial Crisis, the focus across all EU member states has been gradually to implement austerity measures, with the purpose of lowering the budget deficits to levels below 3% of GDP, so that the debt level would either stay below -or start decline towards- the 60% limit defined by the Stability and Growth Pact. In order to further restore the confidence in Europe, 23 out of 27 EU countries also agreed on adopting the Euro Plus Pact, consisting of political reforms to improve fiscal strength and competitiveness; and 25 out of 27 EU countries also decided to implement the Fiscal Compact which include the commitment of each participating country to introduce a balanced budget amendment as part of their national law/constitution. The Fiscal Compact is a direct successor of the previous Stability and Growth Pact, but it is more strict, not only because criteria compliance will be secured through its integration into national law/constitution, but also because it starting from 2014 will require all ratifying countries not involved in ongoing bailout programmes, to comply with the new strict criteria of only having a structural deficit of either maximum 0.5% or 1% (depending on the debt level). Each of the eurozone countries being involved in a bailout program (Greece, Portugal and Ireland) was asked both to follow a program with fiscal consolidation/austerity, and to restore competitiveness through implementation of structural reforms and internal devaluation, i.e. lowering their relative production costs. The measures implemented to restore competitiveness in the weakest countries are needed, not only to build the foundation for GDP growth, but also in order to decrease the current account imbalances among eurozone member states. It has been a long known belief that austerity measures will always reduce the GDP growth in the short term. The reason why Europe nevertheless chose the path of austerity measures, is because they on the medium and long term have been found to benefit and prosper GDP growth, as countries with healthy debt levels in return will be rewarded by the financial markets with higher confidence and lower interest rates. Some economists believing in Keynesian policies, however criticized the timing and amount of austerity measures being called for in the bailout programmes, as they argued such extensive measures should not be implemented during the crisis years with an ongoing recession, but if possible delayed until the years after some positive real GDP growth had returned. In October 2012, a report published by International Monetary Fund (IMF) also found, that tax hikes and spending cuts during the most recent decade had indeed damaged the GDP growth more severely, compared to what had been expected and forecasted in advance (based on the \\"GDP damage ratios\\" previously recorded in earlier decades and under different economic scenarios). Already a half-year earlier, several European countries as a response to the problem with subdued GDP growth in the eurozone, likewise had called for the implementation of a new reinforced growth strategy based on additional public investments, to be financed by growth-friendly taxes on property, land, wealth, and financial institutions. In June 2012, EU leaders agreed as a first step to moderately increase the funds of the European Investment Bank, in order to kick-start infrastructure projects and increase loans to the private sector. A few months later 11 out of 17 eurozone countries also agreed to introduce a new EU financial transaction tax to be collected from 1 January 2014. =Progress= In April 2012, Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs in Brussels, \\"enthusiastically announced to EU parliamentarians in mid-April that 'there was a breakthrough before Easter'. He said the European heads of state had given the green light to pilot projects worth billions, such as building highways in Greece.\\" Other growth initiatives include \\"project bonds\\" wherein the EIB would \\"provide guarantees that safeguard private investors. In the pilot phase until 2013, EU funds amounting to ‚Ç¨230 million are expected to mobilize investments of up to ‚Ç¨4.6 billion.\\" Der Spiegel also said: \\"According to sources inside the German government, instead of funding new highways, Berlin is interested in supporting innovation and programs to promote small and medium-sized businesses. To ensure that this is done as professionally as possible, the Germans would like to see the southern European countries receive their own state-owned development banks, modeled after Germany's [Marshall Plan-era-origin] Kreditanstalt f√ºr Wiederaufbau (KfW) banking group. It's hoped that this will get the economy moving in Greece and Portugal.\\"B√∂ll, Sven, et al., (trans. Paul Cohen), \\"Austerity Backlash: What Merkel's Isolation Means For the Euro Crisis\\", Der Spielgel, 05/01/2012. Retrieved 2012-05-01. Increase competitiveness Crisis countries must significantly increase their international competitiveness to generate economic growth and improve their terms of trade. Indian-American journalist Fareed Zakaria notes in November 2011 that no debt restructuring will work without growth, even more so as European countries \\"face pressures from three fronts: demography (an aging population), technology (which has allowed companies to do much more with fewer people) and globalization (which has allowed manufacturing and services to locate across the world).\\" In case of economic shocks, policy makers typically try to improve competitiveness by depreciating the currency, as in the case of Iceland, which suffered the largest financial crisis in 2008‚Äì2011 in economic history but has since vastly improved its position. However, eurozone countries cannot devalue their currency. =Internal devaluation= Relative change in unit labour costs, 2000‚Äì2011 As a workaround many policy makers try to restore competitiveness through internal devaluation, a painful economic adjustment process, where a country aims to reduce its unit labour costs. German economist Hans-Werner Sinn noted in 2012 that Ireland was the only country that had implemented relative wage moderation in the last five years, which helped decrease its relative price/wage levels by 16%. Greece would need to bring this figure down by 31%, effectively reaching the level of Turkey. By 2012, wages in Greece have been cut to a level last seen in the late 1990s. Purchasing power dropped even more to the level of 1986. Other economists argue that no matter how much Greece and Portugal drive down their wages, they could never compete with low-cost developing countries such as China or India. Instead weak European countries must shift their economies to higher quality products and services, though this is a long-term process and may not bring immediate relief. =Fiscal devaluation= Another option would be to implement fiscal devaluation, based on an idea originally developed by John Maynard Keynes in 1931.Keynes, J M , (1931), Addendum to: Great Britain. Committee on Finance and Industry Report [Macmillan Report] (London:His Majesty ÃÅs Stationery Office, 1931) 190‚Äì209. Reprinted in Donald Moggridge, The Collected Writings of John Maynard Keynes, vol. 20 (London: Macmillan and Cambridge: Cambridge Press for the Royal Economic Society, 1981), 283‚Äì309. According to this neo-Keynesian logic, policy makers can increase the competitiveness of an economy by lowering corporate tax burden such as employer's social security contributions, while offsetting the loss of government revenues through higher taxes on consumption (VAT) and pollution, i.e. by pursuing an ecological tax reform. Germany has successfully pushed its economic competitiveness by increasing the value added tax (VAT) by three percentage points in 2007, and using part of the additional revenues to lower employer's unemployment insurance contribution. Portugal has taken a similar stance and also France appears to follow this suit. In November 2012 French president Fran√ßois Hollande announced plans to reduce tax burden of the corporate sector by within three years, while increasing the standard VAT from 19.6% to 20% and introducing additional eco-taxes in 2016. To minimize negative effects of such policies on purchasing power and economic activity the French government will partly offset the tax hikes by decreasing employees' social security contributions by and by reducing the lower VAT for convenience goods (necessities) from 5.5% to 5%. =Progress= Eurozone economic health and adjustment progress 2011‚Äì2012 (Source: Euro Plus Monitor) On 15 November 2011, the Lisbon Council published the Euro Plus Monitor 2011. According to the report most critical eurozone member countries are in the process of rapid reforms.EU austerity drive country by country, BBC (21 May 2012) The authors note that \\"Many of those countries most in need to adjust [...] are now making the greatest progress towards restoring their fiscal balance and external competitiveness\\". Greece, Ireland and Spain are among the top five reformers and Portugal is ranked seventh among 17 countries included in the report (see graph). In its latest Euro Plus Monitor Report 2012, published in November 2012, the Lisbon Council finds that the eurozone has slightly improved its overall health. With the exception of Greece, all eurozone crisis countries are either close to the point where they have achieved the major adjustment or are likely to get there over the course of 2013. Portugal and Italy are expected to progress to the turnaround stage in spring 2013, possibly followed by Spain in autumn, while the fate of Greece continues to hang in the balance. Overall, the authors suggest that if the eurozone gets through the current acute crisis and stays on the reform path \\"it could eventually emerge from the crisis as the most dynamic of the major Western economies\\". Address current account imbalances Current account imbalances (1997‚Äì2013) Regardless of the corrective measures chosen to solve the current predicament, as long as cross border capital flows remain unregulated in the euro area, current account imbalances are likely to continue. A country that runs a large current account or trade deficit (i.e., importing more than it exports) must ultimately be a net importer of capital; this is a mathematical identity called the balance of payments. In other words, a country that imports more than it exports must either decrease its savings reserves or borrow to pay for those imports. Conversely, Germany's large trade surplus (net export position) means that it must either increase its savings reserves or be a net exporter of capital, lending money to other countries to allow them to buy German goods. The 2009 trade deficits for Italy, Spain, Greece, and Portugal were estimated to be , $75.31bn and $35.97bn, and $25.6bn respectively, while Germany's trade surplus was $188.6bn. A similar imbalance exists in the U.S., which runs a large trade deficit (net import position) and therefore is a net borrower of capital from abroad. Ben Bernanke warned of the risks of such imbalances in 2005, arguing that a \\"savings glut\\" in one country with a trade surplus can drive capital into other countries with trade deficits, artificially lowering interest rates and creating asset bubbles. A country with a large trade surplus would generally see the value of its currency appreciate relative to other currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases. This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting country's currency used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalizing the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments. Either way, many of the countries involved in the crisis are on the euro, so devaluation, individual interest rates and capital controls are not available. The only solution left to raise a country's level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits. For example, if a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this would reduce its trade deficit. It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits (e.g. Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries. On the other hand, export driven countries with a large trade surplus, such as Germany, Austria and the Netherlands would need to shift their economies more towards domestic services and increase wages to support domestic consumption. =Progress= In its spring 2012 economic forecast, the European Commission finds \\"some evidence that the current- account rebalancing is underpinned by changes in relative prices and competitiveness positions as well as gains in export market shares and expenditure switching in deficit countries.\\" In May 2012 German finance minister Wolfgang Sch√§uble has signaled support for a significant increase in German wages to help decrease current account imbalances within the eurozone. Mobilization of credit A number of proposals were made in the summer of 2012 to purchase the debt of distressed European countries such as Spain and Italy. Markus Brunnermeier, the economist Graham Bishop, and Daniel Gros were among those advancing proposals. Finding a formula which was not simply backed by Germany is central in crafting an acceptable and effective remedy. Commentary US President Barack Obama stated in June 2012: \\"Right now, [Europe's] focus has to be on strengthening their overall banking system...making a series of decisive actions that give people confidence that the banking system is solid...In addition, they‚Äôre going to have to look at how do they achieve growth at the same time as they‚Äôre carrying out structural reforms that may take two or three or five years to fully accomplish. So countries like Spain and Italy, for example, have embarked on some smart structural reforms that everybody thinks are necessary ‚Äì everything from tax collection to labor markets to a whole host of different issues. But they've got to have the time and the space for those steps to succeed. And if they are just cutting and cutting and cutting, and their unemployment rate is going up and up and up, and people are pulling back further from spending money because they're feeling a lot of pressure ‚Äì that can make it harder for them to carry out some of these reforms over the long term...[I]n addition to sensible ways to deal with debt and government finances, there's a parallel discussion that's taking place among European leaders to figure out how do we also encourage growth and show some flexibility to allow some of these reforms to really take root.\\"President Obama-Remarks by the President-June 2012 The Economist wrote in June 2012: \\"Outside Germany, a consensus has developed on what Mrs. Merkel must do to preserve the single currency. It includes shifting from austerity to a far greater focus on economic growth; complementing the single currency with a banking union (with euro-wide deposit insurance, bank oversight and joint means for the recapitalization or resolution of failing banks); and embracing a limited form of debt mutualization to create a joint safe asset and allow peripheral economies the room gradually to reduce their debt burdens. This is the refrain from Washington, Beijing, London and indeed most of the capitals of the euro zone.

Probably one of Watteau's earliest painting, created roughly 1706-1710, it depicts a group of quite courtly peasants dancing among the trees. Description Amid the trees, a group of villagers play music while a couple dances. A toddler copies the lady's motions, entertaining the company. Rather than the usual contemporary association with debauchery, music here alludes to social harmony and order. The musicians glance coyly at the viewer, actors very aware of their spectators. This sort of interaction is one of Watteau's hallmarks. It is an image of visual extremes: the dark forest background brings the peasants' bright clothing into sharp contrast. The rustic setting and the dancers' formal attire channel both the f√™te galante and a formal court celebration transplanted to a charming bit of countryside. Historical information This is Watteau's earliest known painting, but already he had developed his own style. Painted shortly after he moved from Valenciennes to Paris, Watteau took the merry rustic scenes favored by his Flemish antecedents like Pieter Bruegel and Peter Paul Rubens, but gave them unprecedented grace, nobility, and style. Though painting a standard northern European subject, he drew heavily on Venetian landscapes, particularly in the atmospheric effects. It is, in effect, a declaration in favor of the Rococo movement with which Watteau would become so heavily associated. =Acquisition= The Country Dance was acquired by the IMA in 1974, a gift of Mrs. Herman C.

History The XVI Corps was initially constituted on 1 October 1933 as part of the Organized Reserves, and was activated on 7 December 1943 at Fort Riley, Kansas. During World War II, XVI Corps fought in the European Theater of Operations as part of the Ninth United States Army. The Corps comprised the 29th Infantry Division under Major General Charles H. Gerhardt, the 75th Infantry Division under Major General Ray E. Porter, the 79th Infantry Division under Major General Ira T. Wyche, and the 95th Infantry Division under Major General Harry L.

They try and deal with the difficulty that some countries in the euro area have experience trying to repay or re-finance their government debt without the assistance of third parties. The solutions range from tighter fiscal union, the issuing of Eurozone bonds to debt write-offs, each of which has both financial and political implications, meaning no solution has found favour with all parties involved. Background to the crisis Public debt $ and %GDP (2010) for selected European countries Government debt of Eurozone, Germany and crisis countries compared to Eurozone GDP The European sovereign debt crisis resulted from a combination of complex factors, including the globalization of finance; easy credit conditions during the 2002‚Äì2008 period that encouraged high-risk lending and borrowing practices; the 2007‚Äì2012 global financial crisis; international trade imbalances; real-estate bubbles that have since burst; the 2008‚Äì2012 global recession; fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses; and approaches used by nations to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socializing losses. One narrative describing the causes of the crisis begins with the significant increase in savings available for investment during the 2000‚Äì2007 period when the global pool of fixed-income securities increased from approximately $36 trillion in 2000 to $70 trillion by 2007. This \\"Giant Pool of Money\\" increased as savings from high-growth developing nations entered global capital markets. Investors searching for higher yields than those offered by U.S. Treasury bonds sought alternatives globally. The temptation offered by such readily available savings overwhelmed the policy and regulatory control mechanisms in country after country, as lenders and borrowers put these savings to use, generating bubble after bubble across the globe. While these bubbles have burst, causing asset prices (e.g., housing and commercial property) to decline, the liabilities owed to global investors remain at full price, generating questions regarding the solvency of governments and their banking systems. How each European country involved in this crisis borrowed and invested the money varies. For example, Ireland's banks lent the money to property developers, generating a massive property bubble. When the bubble burst, Ireland's government and taxpayers assumed private debts. In Greece, the government increased its commitments to public workers in the form of extremely generous wage and pension benefits, with the former doubling in real terms over 10 years. Iceland's banking system grew enormously, creating debts to global investors (external debts) several times GDP. The interconnection in the global financial system means that if one nation defaults on its sovereign debt or enters into recession putting some of the external private debt at risk, the banking systems of creditor nations face losses. For example, in October 2011, Italian borrowers owed French banks $366 billion (net). Should Italy be unable to finance itself, the French banking system and economy could come under significant pressure, which in turn would affect France's creditors and so on. This is referred to as financial contagion. Another factor contributing to interconnection is the concept of debt protection. Institutions entered into contracts called credit default swaps (CDS) that result in payment should default occur on a particular debt instrument (including government issued bonds). But, since multiple CDSs can be purchased on the same security, it is unclear what exposure each country's banking system now has to CDS. Greece hid its growing debt and deceived EU officials with the help of derivatives designed by major banks. Although some financial institutions clearly profited from the growing Greek government debt in the short run, there was a long lead-up to the crisis. Proposals A number of different long-term proposals have been put forward by various parties to deal with the Eurozone crises, these include; =European fiscal union= Increased European integration giving a central body increased control over the budgets of member states was proposed on 14 June 2012 by Jens Weidmann President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, expanding on ideas first proposed by Jean-Claude Trichet, former president of the European Central Bank. Control, including requirements that taxes be raised or budgets cut, would be exercised only when fiscal imbalances developed. This proposal is similar to contemporary calls by Angela Merkel for increased political and fiscal union which would \\"allow Europe oversight possibilities.\\" =European bank recovery and resolution authority= European banks are estimated to have incurred losses approaching ‚Ç¨1 trillion between the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2007 and 2010. The European Commission approved some ‚Ç¨4.5 trillion in state aid for banks between October 2008 and October 2011, a sum which includes the value of taxpayer-funded recapitalizations and public guarantees on banking debts. This has prompted some economists such as Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman to note that Europe is not suffering from a sovereign debt crisis but rather from a banking crisis. On 6 June 2012, the European Commission adopted a legislative proposal for a harmonized bank recovery and resolution mechanism. The proposed framework sets out the necessary steps and powers to ensure that bank failures across the EU are managed in a way which avoids financial instability. The new legislation would give member states the power to impose losses, resulting from a bank failure, on the bondholders to minimize costs for taxpayers. The proposal is part of a new scheme in which banks will be compelled to \\"bail-in\\" their creditors whenever they fail, the basic aim being to prevent taxpayer-funded bailouts in the future. The public authorities would also be given powers to replace the management teams in banks even before the lender fails. Each institution would also be obliged to set aside at least one per cent of the deposits covered by their national guarantees for a special fund to finance the resolution of banking crisis starting in 2018. =Eurobonds= A growing number of investors and economists say Eurobonds would be the best way of solving a debt crisis, though their introduction matched by tight financial and budgetary coordination may well require changes in EU treaties. On 21 November 2011, the European Commission suggested that eurobonds issued jointly by the 17 euro nations would be an effective way to tackle the financial crisis. Using the term \\"stability bonds\\", Jose Manuel Barroso insisted that any such plan would have to be matched by tight fiscal surveillance and economic policy coordination as an essential counterpart so as to avoid moral hazard and ensure sustainable public finances. Germany remains largely opposed at least in the short term to a collective takeover of the debt of states that have run excessive budget deficits and borrowed excessively over the past years, saying this could substantially raise the country's liabilities. =European Monetary Fund= On 20 October 2011, the Austrian Institute of Economic Research published an article that suggests transforming the EFSF into a European Monetary Fund (EMF), which could provide governments with fixed interest rate Eurobonds at a rate slightly below medium-term economic growth (in nominal terms). These bonds would not be tradable but could be held by investors with the EMF and liquidated at any time. Given the backing of all eurozone countries and the ECB \\"the EMU would achieve a similarly strong position vis-a-vis financial investors as the US where the Fed backs government bonds to an unlimited extent.\\" To ensure fiscal discipline despite lack of market pressure, the EMF would operate according to strict rules, providing funds only to countries that meet fiscal and macroeconomic criteria. Governments lacking sound financial policies would be forced to rely on traditional (national) governmental bonds with less favorable market rates. The econometric analysis suggests that \\"If the short-term and long- term interest rates in the euro area were stabilized at 1.5% and 3%, respectively, aggregate output (GDP) in the euro area would be 5 percentage points above baseline in 2015\\". At the same time sovereign debt levels would be significantly lower with, e.g., Greece's debt level falling below 110% of GDP, more than 40 percentage points below the baseline scenario with market based interest levels. Furthermore, banks would no longer be able to unduly benefit from intermediary profits by borrowing from the ECB at low rates and investing in government bonds at high rates. =Drastic debt write-off financed by wealth tax= Overall debt levels in 2009 and write-offs necessary in the Eurozone, UK and U.S. to reach sustainable grounds. According to the Bank for International Settlements, the combined private and public debt of 18 OECD countries nearly quadrupled between 1980 and 2010, and will likely continue to grow, reaching between 250% (for Italy) and about 600% (for Japan) by 2040. A BIS study released in June 2012 warns that budgets of most advanced economies, excluding interest payments, \\"would need 20 consecutive years of surpluses exceeding 2 per cent of gross domestic product ‚Äì starting now ‚Äì just to bring the debt-to-GDP ratio back to its pre-crisis level\\". The same authors found in a previous study that increased financial burden imposed by aging populations and lower growth makes it unlikely that indebted economies can grow out of their debt problem if only one of the following three conditions is met: * government debt is more than 80 to 100 percent of GDP; * non-financial corporate debt is more than 90 percent; * private household debt is more than 85 percent of GDP. The first condition, which was suggested by an influential paper written by Kenneth Rogoff & Carmen Reinhart has been disputed due to major calculation errors. In fact, the average GDP growth at public debt/GDP ratios over 90 percent is not dramatically different than when debt/GDP ratios are lower. The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) added to the original finding that if the overall debt load continues to grow faster than the economy, then large-scale debt restructuring becomes inevitable. To prevent a vicious upward debt spiral from gaining momentum the authors urge policy makers to \\"act quickly and decisively\\" and aim for an overall debt level well below 180 percent for the private and government sector. This number is based on the assumption that governments, nonfinancial corporations, and private households can each sustain a debt load of 60 percent of GDP, at an interest rate of 5 percent and a nominal economic growth rate of 3 percent per year. Lower interest rates and/or higher growth would help reduce the debt burden further. To reach sustainable levels the Eurozone must reduce its overall debt level by ‚Ç¨6.1 trillion. According to BCG this could be financed by a one-time wealth tax of between 11 and 30 percent for most countries, apart from the crisis countries (particularly Ireland) where a write-off would have to be substantially higher. The authors admit that such programs would be \\"drastic\\", \\"unpopular\\" and \\"require broad political coordination and leadership\\" but they maintain that the longer politicians and central bankers wait, the more necessary such a step will be. Instead of a one-time write-off, German economist Harald Spehl has called for a 30-year debt-reduction plan, similar to the one Germany used after World War II to share the burden of reconstruction and development. Similar calls have been made by political parties in Germany including the Greens and The Left.http://www.gruene- bundestag.de/cms/finanzen/dok/367/367285.die_gruene_vermoegensabgabe.html https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/wirtschaftspolitik/vermoegensabgabe- wie-die-gruenen-100-milliarden-einsammeln-wollen-1575784.html See also * 2000s commodities boom * 2007‚Äì2012 global financial crisis * 2008‚Äì2012 Icelandic financial crisis * 2008‚Äì2012 global recession * Crisis situations and protests in Europe since 2000 * European sovereign-debt crisis: List of acronyms * European sovereign-debt crisis: List of protagonists * Federal Reserve Economic Data FRED * Late-2000s recession in Europe * List of countries by credit rating * Liikanen report References External links *The EU Crisis Pocket Guide by the Transnational Institute in English (2012) ‚Äì Italian (2012) ‚Äì Spanish (2011) *2011 Dahrendorf Symposium ‚Äì Changing the Debate on Europe ‚Äì Moving Beyond Conventional Wisdoms *2011 Dahrendorf Symposium Blog *Eurostat ‚Äì Statistics Explained: Structure of government debt (October 2011 data) *Interactive Map of the Debt Crisis Economist Magazine, 9 February 2011 *European Debt Crisis New York Times topic page updated daily. *Tracking Europe's Debt Crisis New York Times topic page, with latest headline by country (France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain). *Map of European Debts New York Times 20 December 2010 *Budget deficit from 2007 to 2015 Economist Intelligence Unit 30 March 2011 *Protests in Greece in Response to Severe Austerity Measures in EU, IMF Bailout ‚Äì video report by Democracy Now! *Diagram of Interlocking Debt Positions of European Countries New York Times 1 May 2010 *Argentina: Life After Default Sand and Colours 2 August 2010 *Google ‚Äì public data: Government Debt in Europe *Stefan Collignon: Democratic requirements for a European Economic Government Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, December 2010 (PDF 625 KB) *Nick Malkoutzis: Greece ‚Äì A Year in Crisis Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, Juni 2011 * Kuliabin A.

The smokehouse on the property was built in the 1800s and was used by Kentucky farmers to shelter the process of curing their meat. Flatboat Located just behind the Jane's Saddlebag building is a replica of a 1700s flatboat used by the early settlers wanting to travel further west down the river. This flatboat is available for any visitor to tour and view how early settlers would travel the river to their destinations. The flatboat was the cheapest mode of transportation for settlers and was mainly used for shorter one-way trips to their homes and then eventually broken down and used for lumber. The flatboat represents the mode of transportation that the settlers Lewis and Clark used to travel the river. The nearby Big Bone State Park is a Lewis and Clark national historic trail site.

The exact number of coins minted is not known, as part of the archives was destroyed in the war, but some data indicate that about 3,406,066 pieces were struck. Between 1935 and 1936, 1,586,000 1 kroon coins were minted. Designed by graphic artist G√ºnther Reindorff, it depicts the image of a 13th-century Viking cargo ship. Monetary reform With the Estonian monetary reform in January 1928 the law was changed as the Riigikogu had an amendment made to the law which stated that coins of 1 and 2 krooni could be minted in other metals, not only in silver as had been the case. As the silver coins of previous coinage had been too expensive, it was decided that this requirement would have to be eliminated. The corresponding change in the law came into effect on 24 March 1934. As published by the Riigi Teataja, the Economics Department of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Estonia announced that the Money Amendment Act (RT 30 of 1933) ¬ß¬ß 4 and 5, allowed the Economics Department of the Ministry of Finance to put in circulation the one-kroon coin as of 1 August 1934. The shape, dimensions, hardness, and metal composition amended within the meaning of the Act remained as such according to the law, but had yet to be approved by the government. On 25 November 1940, the Occupation of the Baltic states by the Soviet authorities put into circulation the ruble, and on 25 March 1941, three months before the outbreak of the war with the Third Reich, the Estonian crown was withdrawn from circulation. During the German (1941-1944) and Soviet (1944-1991) occupation of Estonia, foreign currency introduced by the occupiers remained in circulation. Designing As in the case of the Estonian Mark, the Bank of Estonia announced a competition for the design of new banknotes and coins to be held on 4 June 1926. The competition was attended by many well-known artists of the period such as Eduard Wiiralt, Peet Aren, Roman Nyman, and Nikolai Triik. The winner was graphic artist G√ºnther Reindorff, who had already designed the coins for the Estonian mark. Coined in aluminum-bronze, the coin shows a golden color and weighs 6 grams (permissible error of ¬± 1%), has a diameter of 2.525 inches (¬± 0.5%), with value equivalent to 0.4032 grams of gold, being its edge smooth. The obverse of the coin bears in the center a large state seal, the coat of arms of Estonia, topped with an arc-shaped text which reads \\"Eesti Vabariik\\", and the year of issue \\"1934\\" at the bottom edge. The reverse depicts the Viking ship knarr (knorr) at sea, under which the inscription 1 kroon appears. Coins with the same design were minted in 1990, but they are not legal tender, having been produced as souvenirs. One version is even less original, having a diameter of only 16 mm and on the front the inscription \\"Eesti\\" instead of \\"Eesti Vabariik\\". These coins are both made of gold as well as silver. Another re-issued version of the coin is about its original size, but the quality of the parts is much worse. In 2012, the 1934 one-kroon coin was voted \\"the prettiest coin ever to be in circulation in Estonia\\".

On a national scale, it loosely represents the proportion of all production that crosses the boundaries of a country, as well as the number of jobs in that country dependent upon external trade. On a global scale, it represents the proportion of all world production that is used for imports and exports between countries. * For an individual country, trade globalization is measured as the proportion of that country's total volume of trade to its Gross Domestic Product (GDP): ::\\\\frac {Imports+Exports} {GDP} * For the world as a whole, trade globalization is the share of total world trade in total world production (GDP), where the sums are taken over all countries: ::\\\\frac {\\\\sum Exports} {\\\\sum GDP} Definition Preyer and Br√∂s provide a simple operationalization of trade globalization as \\"the proportion of all world production that crosses international boundaries\\". Chase-Dunn et al. note that trade globalization is one of the types of economic globalization, and define trade globalization as \\"the extent to which the long-distance and global exchange of commodities has increased (or decreased) relative to the exchange of commodities within national societies\\", and precisely operationalize it as \\"the sum of all international exports as a percentage of the global product, which is the sum of all the national gross domestic products (GDPs).\\" Erreygers and Vermeire define trade globalization as \\"the degree of dissimilarity between the actual distribution of bilateral trade flows and their gravity benchmark, determined only by size and distance.\\" They note that trade globalization would be maximized in a situation where only size and distance affected the intensity of bilateral trade flows - in other words, in a situation where neither trade barriers nor other factors would matter. Salvatore Babones notes that trade globalization is the indicator of a country's level of globalization most commonly used in empirical literature. Data for most countries in the modern era are available from the World Bank World Development Indicators database. Trend Chase- Dunn et al. note that there have been cyclical waves of trade globalization, with declines corresponding to wars and economic depressions, and that there has been a steady trend over the centuries for trade globalization to increase. With regards to the modern age, trade globalization increased until 1880, then decreased until 1905, increased again until 1914, decreased during World War I, increased until 1929, decreased until the end of World War II, and has been growing steadily since. They note that the main explanatory factors in this trend are the continued decline in transportation and communication costs, and stability provided by the \\"hegemonic system\\" supportive of trade in recent world-systems. Decreases can be explained by wars, and periods of conflict and tension often leading to them, where international actors cannot reach consensus on trade agreements and usually give in to protectionism.

Public debt $ and %GDP (2010) for selected European countries Government debt of Eurozone, Germany and crisis countries compared to Eurozone GDP The European sovereign debt crisis resulted from a combination of complex factors, including the globalization of finance; easy credit conditions during the 2002‚Äì2008 period that encouraged high-risk lending and borrowing practices; the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08; international trade imbalances; real-estate bubbles that have since burst; fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses; and approaches used by nations to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socializing losses. One narrative describing the causes of the crisis begins with the significant increase in savings available for investment during the 2000‚Äì2007 period when the global pool of fixed-income securities increased from approximately $36 trillion in 2000 to $70 trillion by 2007. This \\"Giant Pool of Money\\" increased as savings from high-growth developing nations entered global capital markets. Investors searching for higher yields than those offered by U.S. Treasury bonds sought alternatives globally. The temptation offered by such readily available savings overwhelmed the policy and regulatory control mechanisms in country after country, as lenders and borrowers put these savings to use, generating bubble after bubble across the globe. While these bubbles have burst, causing asset prices (e.g., housing and commercial property) to decline, the liabilities owed to global investors remain at full price, generating questions regarding the solvency of governments and their banking systems. How each European country involved in this crisis borrowed and invested the money varies. For example, Ireland's banks lent the money to property developers, generating a massive property bubble. When the bubble burst, Ireland's government and taxpayers assumed private debts. In Greece, the government increased its commitments to public workers in the form of extremely generous wage and pension benefits, with the former doubling in real terms over 10 years. Iceland's banking system grew enormously, creating debts to global investors (external debts) several times GDP. The interconnection in the global financial system means that if one nation defaults on its sovereign debt or enters into recession putting some of the external private debt at risk, the banking systems of creditor nations face losses. For example, in October 2011, Italian borrowers owed French banks $366 billion (net). Should Italy be unable to finance itself, the French banking system and economy could come under significant pressure, which in turn would affect France's creditors and so on. This is referred to as financial contagion. Another factor contributing to interconnection is the concept of debt protection. Institutions entered into contracts called credit default swaps (CDS) that result in payment should default occur on a particular debt instrument (including government issued bonds). But, since multiple CDSs can be purchased on the same security, it is unclear what exposure each country's banking system now has to CDS. Greece hid its growing debt and deceived EU officials with the help of derivatives designed by major banks. Although some financial institutions clearly profited from the growing Greek government debt in the short run, there was a long lead-up to the crisis. The European bailouts are largely about shifting exposure from banks and others, who otherwise are lined up for losses on the sovereign debt they have piled up, onto European taxpayers. EU treaty violations =No bail-out clause= The EU's Maastricht Treaty contains juridical language which appears to rule out intra- EU bailouts. First, the \\"no bail-out\\" clause (Article 125 TFEU) ensures that the responsibility for repaying public debt remains national and prevents risk premiums caused by unsound fiscal policies from spilling over to partner countries. The clause thus encourages prudent fiscal policies at the national level. The European Central Bank's purchase of distressed country bonds can be viewed as violating the prohibition of monetary financing of budget deficits (Article 123 TFEU). The creation of further leverage in EFSF with access to ECB lending would also appear to violate the terms of this article. Articles 125 and 123 were meant to create disincentives for EU member states to run excessive deficits and state debt, and prevent the moral hazard of over- spending and lending in good times. They were also meant to protect the taxpayers of the other more prudent member states. By issuing bail-out aid guaranteed by prudent eurozone taxpayers to rule-breaking eurozone countries such as Greece, the EU and eurozone countries also encourage moral hazard in the future. While the no bail-out clause remains in place, the \\"no bail-out doctrine\\" seems to be a thing of the past. =Convergence criteria= The EU treaties contain so called convergence criteria, specified in the protocols of the Treaties of the European Union. Concerning government finance the states have agreed that the annual government budget deficit should not exceed 3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and that the gross government debt to GDP should not exceed 60% of the GDP (see protocol 12 and 13). For eurozone members there is the Stability and Growth Pact which contains the same requirements for budget deficit and debt limitation but with a much stricter regime. In the past, many European countries including Greece and Italy have substantially exceeded these criteria over a long period of time. Actors fueling the crisis =Credit rating agencies= Standard & Poor's Headquarters in Lower Manhattan, New York City The international U.S.-based credit rating agencies‚ÄîMoody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch‚Äîwhich have already been under fire during the housing bubble and the Icelandic crisis‚Äîhave also played a central and controversial role in the current European bond market crisis. On one hand, the agencies have been accused of giving overly generous ratings due to conflicts of interest. On the other hand, ratings agencies have a tendency to act conservatively, and to take some time to adjust when a firm or country is in trouble. In the case of Greece, the market responded to the crisis before the downgrades, with Greek bonds trading at junk levels several weeks before the ratings agencies began to describe them as such. According to a study by economists at St Gallen University credit rating agencies have fueled rising euro zone indebtedness by issuing more severe downgrades since the sovereign debt crisis unfolded in 2009. The authors concluded that rating agencies were not consistent in their judgments, on average rating Portugal, Ireland and Greece 2.3 notches lower than under pre-crisis standards, eventually forcing them to seek international aid. European policy makers have criticized ratings agencies for acting politically, accusing the Big Three of bias towards European assets and fueling speculation. Particularly Moody's decision to downgrade Portugal's foreign debt to the category Ba2 \\"junk\\" has infuriated officials from the EU and Portugal alike. State owned utility and infrastructure companies like ANA ‚Äì Aeroportos de Portugal, Energias de Portugal, Redes Energ√©ticas Nacionais, and Brisa ‚Äì Auto-estradas de Portugal were also downgraded despite claims to having solid financial profiles and significant foreign revenue. France too has shown its anger at its downgrade. French central bank chief Christian Noyer criticized the decision of Standard & Poor's to lower the rating of France but not that of the United Kingdom, which \\"has more deficits, as much debt, more inflation, less growth than us\\". Similar comments were made by high-ranking politicians in Germany. Michael Fuchs, deputy leader of the leading Christian Democrats, said: \\"Standard and Poor's must stop playing politics. Why doesn't it act on the highly indebted United States or highly indebted Britain?\\", adding that the latter's collective private and public sector debts are the largest in Europe. He further added: \\"If the agency downgrades France, it should also downgrade Britain in order to be consistent.\\" Credit rating agencies were also accused of bullying politicians by systematically downgrading eurozone countries just before important European Council meetings. As one EU source put it: \\"It is interesting to look at the downgradings and the timings of the downgradings ... It is strange that we have so many downgrades in the weeks of summits.\\" Regulatory reliance on credit ratings Think-tanks such as the World Pensions Council (WPC) have criticized European powers such as France and Germany for pushing for the adoption of the Basel II recommendations, adopted in 2005 and transposed in European Union law through the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), effective since 2008. In essence, this forced European banks and more importantly the European Central Bank, e.g. when gauging the solvency of EU-based financial institutions, to rely heavily on the standardized assessments of credit risk marketed by only two private US firms- Moody's and S&P.;M. Nicolas J. Firzli, \\"A Critique of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\\" Revue Analyse Financi√®re, 10 Nov. 2011/Q1 2012 Counter measures Due to the failures of the ratings agencies, European regulators obtained new powers to supervise ratings agencies. With the creation of the European Supervisory Authority in January 2011 the EU set up a whole range of new financial regulatory institutions, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which became the EU's single credit-ratings firm regulator. Credit-ratings companies have to comply with the new standards or will be denied operation on EU territory, says ESMA Chief Steven Maijoor. Germany's foreign minister Guido Westerwelle has called for an \\"independent\\" European ratings agency, which could avoid the conflicts of interest that he claimed US-based agencies faced. European leaders are reportedly studying the possibility of setting up a European ratings agency in order that the private U.S.-based ratings agencies have less influence on developments in European financial markets in the future. According to German consultant company Roland Berger, setting up a new ratings agency would cost ‚Ç¨300 million. On 30 January 2012, the company said it was already collecting funds from financial institutions and business intelligence agencies to set up an independent non- profit ratings agency by mid-2012, which could provide its first country ratings by the end of the year. In April 2012, in a similar attempt, the Bertelsmann Stiftung presented a blueprint for establishing an international non-profit credit rating agency (INCRA) for sovereign debt, structured in way that management and rating decisions are independent from its financiers. But attempts to regulate more strictly credit rating agencies in the wake of the European sovereign debt crisis have been rather unsuccessful. World Pensions Council (WPC) financial law and regulation experts have argued that the hastily drafted, unevenly transposed in national law, and poorly enforced EU rule on ratings agencies (Regulation EC N¬∞ 1060/2009) has had little effect on the way financial analysts and economists interpret data or on the potential for conflicts of interests created by the complex contractual arrangements between credit rating agencies and their clients\\" =Media= Some in the Greek, Spanish, and French press and elsewhere spread conspiracy theories that claimed that the U.S. and Britain were deliberately promoting rumors about the euro in order to cause its collapse or to distract attention from their own economic vulnerabilities. The Economist rebutted these \\"Anglo-Saxon conspiracy\\" claims, writing that although American and British traders overestimated the weakness of southern European public finances and the probability of the breakup of the eurozone breakup, these sentiments were an ordinary market panic, rather than some deliberate plot. Greek Prime Minister Papandreou is quoted as saying that there was no question of Greece leaving the euro and suggested that the crisis was politically as well as financially motivated. \\"This is an attack on the eurozone by certain other interests, political or financial\\". The Spanish Prime Minister Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero has also suggested that the recent financial market crisis in Europe is an attempt to undermine the euro. He ordered the Centro Nacional de Inteligencia intelligence service (National Intelligence Center, CNI in Spanish) to investigate the role of the \\"Anglo-Saxon media\\" in fomenting the crisis. So far no results have been reported from this investigation. A major reason for this media coverage were Greek officials' unprecedented statements acknowledging Greece's serious economic woes. For example, during an EU summit at December 2009, newly elected Greek Prime Minister Georges Papandreou said that the public sector is corrupt, a statement later repeated to the international media by Jos√© Manuel Barroso,http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6871e1e6-e6be-11de-98b1-00144feab49a.html European Commission -president. The previous month, Papandreou said \\"we need to save the country from the bankruptcy,\\" a statement to which the market reacted.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/6630117/Greece- tests-the-limit-of-sovereign-debt-as-it-grinds-towards-slump.html =Speculators= Both the Spanish and Greek Prime Ministers have accused financial speculators and hedge funds of worsening the crisis by short selling euros. German chancellor Merkel has stated that \\"institutions bailed out with public funds are exploiting the budget crisis in Greece and elsewhere.\\" The role of Goldman Sachs in Greek bond yield increases is also under scrutiny. It is not yet clear to what extent this bank has been involved in the unfolding of the crisis or if they have made a profit as a result of the sell-off on the Greek government debt market. In response to accusations that speculators were worsening the problem, some markets banned naked short selling for a few months. Speculation about the breakup of the eurozone Economists, mostly from outside Europe and associated with Modern Monetary Theory and other post- Keynesian schools, condemned the design of the euro currency system from the beginning because it ceded national monetary and economic sovereignty but lacked a central fiscal authority. When faced with economic problems, they maintained, \\"Without such an institution, EMU would prevent effective action by individual countries and put nothing in its place.\\" US economist Martin Feldstein went so far to call the euro \\"an experiment that failed\\". Some non- Keynesian economists, such as Luca A. Ricci of the IMF, contend the eurozone does not fulfill the necessary criteria for an optimum currency area, though it is moving in that direction.Ricci, Luca A., \\"Exchange Rate Regimes and Location\\", 1997 As the debt crisis expanded beyond Greece, these economists continued to advocate, albeit more forcefully, the disbandment of the eurozone. If this was not immediately feasible, they recommended that Greece and the other debtor nations unilaterally leave the eurozone, default on their debts, regain their fiscal sovereignty, and re-adopt national currencies.M. Nicolas J. Firzli, \\"Greece and the Roots the EU Debt Crisis\\" The Vienna Review, March 2010\\"I‚Äôll buy the Acropolis\\" by Bill Mitchell, 29 May 2011 Bloomberg suggested in June 2011 that, if the Greek and Irish bailouts should fail, an alternative would be for Germany to leave the eurozone in order to save the currency through depreciation instead of austerity. The likely substantial fall in the euro against a newly reconstituted Deutsche Mark would give a \\"huge boost\\" to its members' competitiveness.\\"To Save the Euro, Germany Must Quit the Euro Zone\\" by Marshall Auerback , 25 May 2011 Iceland, not part of the EU, is regarded as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It defaulted on its debt and drastically devalued its currency, which has effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive. Lee Harris argues that floating exchange rates allows wage reductions by currency devaluations, a politically easier option than the economically equivalent but politically impossible method of lowering wages by political enactment. Sweden's floating rate currency gives it a short term advantage, structural reforms and constraints account for longer-term prosperity. Labor concessions, a minimal reliance on public debt, and tax reform helped to further a pro- growth policy. The Wall Street Journal conjectured as well that Germany could return to the Deutsche Mark, or create another currency union with the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Luxembourg and other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the Baltics. A monetary union of these countries with current account surpluses would create the world's largest creditor bloc, bigger than China or Japan. The Wall Street Journal added that without the German-led bloc, a residual euro would have the flexibility to keep interest rates low and engage in quantitative easing or fiscal stimulus in support of a job-targeting economic policy instead of inflation targeting in the current configuration. =Breakup vs. deeper integration= However, there is opposition in this view. The national exits are expected to be an expensive proposition. The breakdown of the currency would lead to insolvency of several euro zone countries, a breakdown in intrazone payments. Having instability and the public debt issue still not solved, the contagion effects and instability would spread into the system.Anand. M.R, Gupta.G.L, Dash, R. The Euro Zone Crisis Its Dimensions and Implications. January 2012. Having that the exit of Greece would trigger the breakdown of the eurozone, this is not welcomed by many politicians, economists and journalists. According to Steven Erlanger from The New York Times, a \\"Greek departure is likely to be seen as the beginning of the end for the whole euro zone project, a major accomplishment, whatever its faults, in the postwar construction of a Europe \\"whole and at peace.\\" Likewise, the two big leaders of the Euro zone, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy have said on numerous occasions that they would not allow the eurozone to disintegrate and have linked the survival of the Euro with that of the entire European Union. In September 2011, EU commissioner Joaqu√≠n Almunia shared this view, saying that expelling weaker countries from the euro was not an option: \\"Those who think that this hypothesis is possible just do not understand our process of integration\\". The former ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet also denounced the possibility of a return of the Deutsche Mark. The challenges to the speculation about the breakup or salvage of the eurozone is rooted in its innate nature that the breakup or salvage of eurozone is not only an economic decision but also a critical political decision followed by complicated ramifications that \\"If Berlin pays the bills and tells the rest of Europe how to behave, it risks fostering destructive nationalist resentment against Germany and ....it would strengthen the camp in Britain arguing for an exit‚Äîa problem not just for Britons but for all economically liberal Europeans. Solutions which involve greater integration of European banking and fiscal management and supervision of national decisions by European umbrella institutions can be criticized as Germanic domination of European political and economic life. According to US author Ross Douthat \\"This would effectively turn the European Union into a kind of postmodern version of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, with a Germanic elite presiding uneasily over a polyglot imperium and its restive local populations\\". The Economist provides a somewhat modified approach to saving the euro in that \\"a limited version of federalization could be less miserable solution than break-up of the euro.\\" The recipe to this tricky combination of the limited federalization, greatly lies on mutualization for limiting the fiscal integration. In order for overindebted countries to stabilize the dwindling euro and economy, the overindebted countries require \\"access to money and for banks to have a \\"safe\\" euro-wide class of assets that is not tied to the fortunes of one country\\" which could be obtained by \\"narrower Eurobond that mutualises a limited amount of debt for a limited amount of time.\\" The proposition made by German Council of Economic Experts provides detailed blue print to mutualize the current debts of all euro-zone economies above 60% of their GDP. Instead of the breakup and issuing new national governments bonds by individual euro-zone governments, \\"everybody, from Germany (debt: 81% of GDP) to Italy (120%) would issue only these joint bonds until their national debts fell to the 60% threshold. The new mutualized-bond market, worth some ‚Ç¨2.3 trillion, would be paid off over the next 25 years. Each country would pledge a specified tax (such as a VAT surcharge) to provide the cash.\\" However, so far German Chancellor Angela Merkel has opposed to all forms of mutualization. The Hungarian-American business magnate George Soros warns in \\"Does the Euro have a Future?\\" that there is no escape from the \\"gloomy scenario\\" of a prolonged European recession and the consequent threat to the Eurozone's political cohesion so long as \\"the authorities persist in their current course.\\" He argues that to save the Euro long-term structural changes are essential in addition to the immediate steps needed to arrest the crisis. The changes he recommends include even greater economic integration of the European Union. Soros writes that a treaty is needed to transform the European Financial Stability Fund into a full-fledged European Treasury. Following the formation of the Treasury, European Council could then ask the European Commission Bank to step into the breach and indemnify the European Commission Bank in advance against potential risks to the Treasury's solvency. Soros acknowledges that converting the EFSF into a European Treasury will necessitate \\"a radical change of heart.\\" In particular, he cautions, Germans will be wary of any such move, not least because many continue to believe that they have a choice between saving the Euro and abandoning it. Soros writes however that a collapse of European Union would precipitate an uncontrollable financial meltdown and thus \\"the only way\\" to avert \\"another Great Depression\\" is the formation of a European Treasury. The British betting company Ladbrokes stopped taking bets on Greece exiting the Eurozone in May 2012 after odds fell to 1/3, and reported \\"plenty of support\\" for 33/1 odds for a complete disbanding of the Eurozone during 2012. Odious debt Some protesters, commentators such as Lib√©ration correspondent Jean Quatremer and the Li√®ge- based NGO Committee for the Abolition of the Third World Debt (CADTM) allege that the debt should be characterized as odious debt. The Greek documentary Debtocracy, and a book of the same title and content examine whether the recent Siemens scandal and uncommercial ECB loans which were conditional on the purchase of military aircraft and submarines are evidence that the loans amount to odious debt and that an audit would result in invalidation of a large amount of the debt. Manipulated debt and deficit statistics In 1992, members of the European Union signed an agreement known as the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels. However, a number of EU member states, including Greece and Italy, were able to circumvent these rules and mask their deficit and debt levels through the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures. The structures were designed by prominent U.S. investment banks, who received substantial fees in return for their services and who took on little credit risk themselves thanks to special legal protections for derivatives counterparties. Financial reforms within the U.S. since the financial crisis have only served to reinforce special protections for derivatives‚Äîincluding greater access to government guarantees‚Äîwhile minimizing disclosure to broader financial markets. The revision of Greece's 2009 budget deficit from a forecast of \\"6‚Äì8% of GDP\\" to 12.7% by the new Pasok Government in late 2009 (a number which, after reclassification of expenses under IMF/EU supervision was further raised to 15.4% in 2010) has been cited as one of the issues that ignited the Greek debt crisis. This added a new dimension in the world financial turmoil, as the issues of \\"creative accounting\\" and manipulation of statistics by several nations came into focus, potentially undermining investor confidence. The focus has naturally remained on Greece due to its debt crisis. There has however been a growing number of reports about manipulated statistics by EU and other nations aiming, as was the case for Greece, to mask the sizes of public debts and deficits. These have included analyses of examples in several countries or have focused on Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, the United States, and even Germany. Collateral for Finland On 18 August 2011, as requested by the Finnish parliament as a condition for any further bailouts, it became apparent that Finland would receive collateral from Greece, enabling it to participate in the potential new support package for the Greek economy. Austria, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Slovakia responded with irritation over this special guarantee for Finland and demanded equal treatment across the eurozone, or a similar deal with Greece, so as not to increase the risk level over their participation in the bailout.Schneeweiss, Zoe, and Kati Pohjanpalo, \\"Finns Set Greek Collateral Trend as Austria, Dutch, Slovaks Follow Demands\\", Bloomberg, 18 August 2011 9:41 am ET. The main point of contention was that the collateral is aimed to be a cash deposit, a collateral the Greeks can only give by recycling part of the funds loaned by Finland for the bailout, which means Finland and the other eurozone countries guarantee the Finnish loans in the event of a Greek default. After extensive negotiations to implement a collateral structure open to all eurozone countries, on 4 October 2011, a modified escrow collateral agreement was reached. The expectation is that only Finland will use it, due to i.a. requirement to contribute initial capital to European Stability Mechanism in one installment instead of five installments over time. Finland, as one of the strongest AAA countries, can raise the required capital with relative ease. At the beginning of October, Slovakia and Netherlands were the last countries to vote on the EFSF expansion, which was the immediate issue behind the collateral discussion, with a mid-October vote.Marsh, David, \\"German OK only small step in averting Greek crisis\\", MarketWatch, 3 Oct 2011, 12:00 am EDT. Retrieved 3 October 2011. On 13 October 2011 Slovakia approved euro bailout expansion, but the government has been forced to call new elections in exchange. In February 2012, the four largest Greek banks agreed to provide the ‚Ç¨880 million in collateral to Finland in order to secure the second bailout program. Finland's recommendation to the crisis countries is to issue asset-backed securities to cover the immediate need, a tactic successfully used in Finland's early 1990s recession, in addition to spending cuts and bad banking.  Effects of IMF/EU austerity policies The recessions experienced in bailed-out countries have been connected with elements of the imposed austerity policies. Especially in Greece, the steep rise of debt-to- GDP ratio (which has climbed to 169,1% in 2013) is predominantly a result of the GDP contraction (in absolute numbers, debt has only risen from 300 billion Euros in 2009 to 320 billion Euros in 2013). A discussion on the relevant policy \\"errors\\" is still ongoing.

It is located in the San Martino's quartiere, near Porta Metauro, at the corner of via Gabrielli and via Capitano del Popolo.  History The building was erected towards the end of the 13th century by Cante de' Gabrielli (1260-1335), who was Signore or lord of Gubbio with the title of Captain of the People (capitano del popolo). The building was one of the city's first public buildings. The palace, whose architect remains unknown, was used as both private residence and public office by Cante Gabrielli, and was built on land already belonging to his family. This area of the town was largely under the influence of the Gabrielli, as exemplified by the fact that other neighbouring constructions, including the towered family palace still visible along the eponymous street, belonged to them. In the 14th century, the palace continued to serve as residence of the Captain of the People, until 1384 when the Dukes of Urbino seized Gubbio, the title was abolished and the building was sold. The palace saw several successive owners before the Ceccarelli family acquired it in the 19th century. On 7 December 1967 Alfio Ceccarelli (1920-2010) and Carlo Ceccarelli sold the property,Marchetti, F. F., (1967). Vendita di immobile in Gubbio, repertorio n. 37866/8182.

Description  Together with the Palazzo dei Consoli and the Palazzo del Bargello in the same town, the palace is an examples of Umbria Gothic style, as later additions were removed by a restoration at the beginning of the 20th century. Its angled, monochromatic fa√ßade, built in the typical local grey limestone, is characterised by four ogival arches on the ground floor, four large ogival windows on the first floor and six smaller ogival windows on the second floor. Floors are marked by string courses running below the windows. The left part of the facade was not restored and still shows later alterations such as square windows and tampered arches. Nowadays the palace hosts a museum dedicated to medieval torture practices and instruments (also known as Museo Cante Gabrielli.

Biography  Descended from a granadino family that was very active in the community, Luis Garc√≠a Montero was born in Granada in 1958 as the son of Luis Garc√≠a L√≥pez and Elisa Montero Pe√±a, and studied at the Colegio Dulce Nombre de Mar√≠a- PP.Escolapios in Granada. As a teenager, he was a fan of equestrian sports and had the opportunity to meet Blas de Otero. He studied Philosophy and literature at the University of Granada, where he was a student of Juan Carlos Rodr√≠guez G√≥mez, a social literature theorist. He received his Masters in 1980 and later became a doctorate in 1985 with a thesis about Rafael Alberti, La norma y los estilos en la poes√≠a de Rafael Alberti or The norm and styles of Rafael Alberti's poetry. He maintained a great friendship with Alberti, a poet of the Generation of '27, and prepared a compilation of all his works of poetry. He began to work as an associate professor at the University of Granada in 1981. He received the Premio Adon√°is de Poes√≠a in 1982 for El jard√≠n extranjero. He created a memoir of his studies in 1984 about El teatro medieval. Pol√©mica de una inexistencia or Medieval theatre. Controversy of an inexistence. He became linked to the poetic group La Otra Setimentalidad (The Other Sentimentality), a wave in which contemporary Spanish poetry took the name of its first joint book, published in 1983, in which poets Javier Egea and √Ålvaro Salvador also participated. The poetics of the group remained reflected above all in this short book and in lesser part in his manifesto Manifiesto albertista (1982) by Luis Garc√≠a Montero and Javier Egea. Their personal trajectory began widening in what would later become known as poes√≠a de la experiencia or poetry of the experience and is characterized by the general tendency to dillude the most personal I in the collective experience, furthering itself from the stylistic and thematic individuality of previous Nov√≠simos authors; Gar√≠a and his group, however, tried to relate themselves with the previous poetic tradition taking in the postulates Luis Cernuda and Jaime Gil de Biedma and tried to unite the aesthetics of Antonio Machado with the thinking of the Generation of the '50s, as well as with Surrealism and the impactful images of Spanish Baroque poets or those of Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez. Gar√≠a Montero's most distinguishable characteristic is the history-biographical narrativism of his poems; a structure almost theatrical or novelistic with a character or protagonist that tells or lives his story through recollection, memory or desire. His poetry is characterized by a colloquial language and by his reflections regarding every day events or situations. He's edited Rimas (Rhymes) by Gustavo Adolfo B√©cquer, among other theoretical works. He has also cultivated the art of essay writing and is an opinion columnist. Between the award-winning poetics that he's received, the most impressive have been the Premio Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, the Premio Loewe, the Premio Adon√°is of poetry and the Premio Nacional de Poes√≠a with which he was awarded in 1995, and the Premio Nacional de la Cr√≠tica in 2003. In 2010 he was awarded in Mexico the Premio Poetas del Mundo Latino for his literary career. Since 1994 he has shared his life with writer Almudena Grandes and has three children. Since he was very young he has been an active member in the PCE and, since its foundation, in the United Left. In the 2004 European Parliament election he was a United Left candidate. Prior to the 2011 Spanish general election he declared his support for United Left. In October 2012 it was announced that he would take on a key role in Izquierda Abierta, a new party led by Gaspar Llamazares and Montse Mu√±oz that was part of the United Left coalition. On 22 October 2008 Luis Garc√≠a Montero was condemned for a libel case in writing an article calling professor Jos√© Antonio Fortes \\"disturbed.\\" While in his classes at the University of Granada and in writing, Fortes called Federico Garc√≠a Lorca a fascist and the exiled writer Francisco Ayala a Nazi. Garc√≠a Montero asked for unpaid leave as a lecturer of said university.

(2010)  Controversies  On 22 October 2008 Luis Garc√≠a Montero was condemned for an injuries case against Jos√© Antonio Fortes, professor at the University of Granada. The poet in an article published in El Pa√≠s called the professor Fortes disturbing for claiming that Lorcan poetry had been served as an ideological breeding ground for fascist poetry. In other writings, Fortes had attacked Francisco Ayala, Antonio Mu√±oz Molina, Joaqu√≠n Sabina, Gustavo Adolfo B√©cquer and Rafael Alberti, as fascist writers or Capitalism sellers. The judge Miguel √Ångel Torres - famous for the known Malaya urbanistic corruption case-, sentenced Luis Garc√≠a Montero to pay a fine of ‚Ç¨1,800 as well as another ‚Ç¨3,000 to the professor Fortes for serious publicity injuries. The poet referred to Fortes as a \\"indecent fool\\", and \\"disturbed\\", and in a meeting with other members of the Department he called him a \\"son of a bitch\\" and an \\"asshole\\". Although he thanked the many institutional and personal solidarity displays, Garc√≠a Montero announced a short time afterward a request for a leave of absence from the lecturer post that he had at the University of Granada, in which he entered as a professor in 1981. He renounces that he left a year later because he found the university Department environment \\"unbreathable\\". One other controversy, this one related to the Premio de Poes√≠a \\"Ciudad de Burgos\\" (2012), appeared published in at least three Spanish newspapers. Thus the Diario de Burgos titled it: \\"Una pol√©mica decisi√≥n del jurado cuestiona la limpieza del Premio \\"Ciudad de Burgos\\" while El Correo de Burgos said \\"La pol√©mica se sirve en verso\\" (\\"Controversy served in verse\\").

It was opened in 1992 at the Ciudad Universitaria in Mexico City. Today it has thirteen halls divided by theme dedicated to various permanent exhibitions. It has worked with outside public and private entities to develop both permanent and temporary exhibitions and has worked to develop other science museums in other areas of the country. Institution left Opened in 1992, Universum is one of the first science museums of its type in Latin America . It is located on a site in the south of the Ciudad Universitaria, an area that houses a number of the university's cultural institutions, which is also part of the Pedregal de San √Ångel ecological reserve. Its facilities cover with dedicated to permanent exhibitions. These permanent exhibitions are housed in thirteen main halls with various themes. Its mission is to contribute to the formation of a scientific and technological culture, and to an interest in science and technology by society in general. For this reason, the exhibitions are designed to increase understanding by using simplified language and attractive presentations. Another of the museum's functions is to archive and make available work done by UNAM's researchers at the facility's library and archives. During the institution's twenty years, it has received over 11 million visitors. Universum has also worked to create extension museums in other parts of the country such as the Museo de Ciencia y Tecnolog√≠a in Chiapas . Permanent exhibits Part of the brain and nervous system exhibition Permanent exhibits are housed in thirteen halls on three floors of the main complex. They include the Jos√© de la Herr√°n Planetarium, the Par√°kata Butterfly Exhibit, the Patli exhibit on medicinal plants, Biodiversity Hall, Mathematics Hall, Golem unit on artificial intelligence, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, The Brain, Chemistry in Everything, The Universe, Euclid‚Äôs Window, Our City, Evolution, Life and Time, Population, Health and Sexuality. A number of its exhibits have been developed in collaboration with private and public entities. The Par√°ka Butterfly Exhibit is an area with live butterflies in an enclosure designed to imitate their natural habitat. It also works to breed butterflies native to the Valley of Mexico. The Health section focuses on human health and its maintenance, with interactive displays, some of which provide personal information. The hall was sponsored by the Asociaci√≥n Nacional de Productores de Refrescos y Aguas Carbonatadas. The space exhibit has real moon rocks which were donated to the institution by NASA. The museum also has an artificial intelligence robot, called Golem, created for interaction with children. It was created by scientists in applied mathematics from UNAM to respond with information modified to the person who is interacting with it. It is the first robot designed to recognize children's voices speaking Spanish. Temporary exhibits loter√≠a\\" as part of a cacao exhibit In addition to its permanent exhibits, the museum also hosts small- and large-scale temporary exhibitions, sometimes in collaboration with other institutions. In 2002, the museum hosted an exhibit called En busca de Teotihuacan:Arqueologia y ciencia (In search of Teotihuacan: Archeology and science) dedicated to the science related to the excavation and interpretation of the remains of the ancient city. In 2004, it hosted robotic displays of savanna animals from Africa such as a hippopotamus waking up, an elephant calling to its child and a crocodile opening its mouth to let birds pick off remains of its meal. The display was created as a collaboration between the university and the Mexican animation company Animatronix. In 2006, an exhibit demonstrating how a virus infects a cell was created by artist and architect Antonio O‚ÄôConnell, made with wood, much of which was recycled from construction sites. In 2010, Tunnel of Science, and exhibit about the mysteries of the universe, was dedicated to German physicist Max Planck. In 2012, the museum held various small exhibits such as ‚ÄúLa ciencia con sabor a chocolate‚Äù (Chocolate flavored science), but its largest temporary exhibition was the inauguration of Body Worlds Vital. Body Worlds is a series of exhibitions of real human bodies which have been ‚Äúplastified‚Äù for display. In this exhibition, it shows the body in movement. Services and events Child with beaker at a chemistry demonstration The museum seeks to engage the public through exhibitions, activities, workshops, conferences, classes, cinema and theater. It also hosts meetings, congresses, book presentations, seminars, roundtables, award ceremonies, demonstrations and more. In summer, the museum hosts classes and courses for children, divided by age group, on science topics. Events in 2012, included the 61st Encuento de Ciencias, Artes y Humanidades (Science, Art and Humanities Encounter), and events to coincide with the transit of Venus across the sun. The 20th anniversary of the museum included conferences, exhibitions, a Science, Arte and Rock Festival, and a Christmas campaign called Regalar tambi√©n tiene ciencia (Giving also has science). Courses for children and adults include basic astronomy, modern astronomy and constructing a telescope. The museum offers internships and other programs for students in undergraduate programs. The museum has rental facilities including the Teatro Universum, Foro de Quimica, Sala Ju√°rez, Auditorio de la Casita de las Ciencias, Cabina de Radio and Sala Luis Estrada., and a cafeteria and full restaurant.

Most encyclopedias and similar sources estimate between 5 and 6 million Bah√° º√≠s in the world in the early 21st century. The religion is almost entirely contained in a single, organized, hierarchical community, but the Bah√° º√≠ population is spread out into almost every country and ethnicity in the world, being recognized as the second-most geographically widespread religion after Christianity. See Bah√° º√≠ statistics. United States =Modern community= In December 1999, the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States stated that out of approximately 140,000 adult (15 and over) members on the rolls, only 70,000 had known addresses. The American Religious Identity Survey (ARIS) conducted in 2001, with a sample size of 50,000, estimated that there were 84,000 self- identifying adult (21 and over) Bah√° º√≠s in the United States. The Association of Religion Data Archives estimated there were some 525,000 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005 however statistics in Feb 2011 show 175,000 excluding Alaska and Hawai'i. Although a majority of Americans are Christians, Bah√° º√≠s make up the second- largest religious group in South Carolina . And based on data from 2010, Bah√° º√≠s were the largest minority religion in 80 counties out of the 3143 counties in the country. While early fictional works relating the religion occurred in Europe a number of them have appeared in the United States since the 1980s, sometimes in mass media - see Bah√° º√≠ Faith in fiction. Canada The Bah√° º√≠ Shrine in Montreal, being the house of May Maxwell and William Sutherland Maxwell, the only private home in Canada where  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° stayed.Montreal Bah√° º√≠ Community: Locations. The Canada 2011 Census National Household Survey recorded 18,945 Bah√° º√≠s. In 2018, the Bah√°‚Äô√≠ Community of Canada's official website stated it had some 30,000 members, with a Spiritual Assembly found in most of the approximately 1,200 Bah√°‚Äô√≠ communities throughout the 13 provinces and territories of Canada. Canada is officially a bilingual (English-French) country, which also has a large population (roughly 5% of total) of indigenous peoples; the Bah√°‚Äô√≠ Community of Canada notes that its membership is quite diverse, French and English, more than 18% of from First Nations and Inuit backgrounds, and 30% foreign born who had immigrated to Canada. The Canadian community is one of the earliest western communities, at one point sharing a joint National Spiritual Assembly with the United States, and is a co-recipient of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Tablets of the Divine Plan. The first North American woman to declare herself a Bah√° º√≠ was Mrs. Kate C. Ives, of Canadian ancestry, though not living in Canada at the time. Moojan Momen, in reviewing \\"The Origins of the Bah√° º√≠ Community of Canada, 1898‚Äì1948\\" notes that \\"the Magee family... are credited with bringing the Bah√° º√≠ Faith to Canada. Edith Magee became a Bah√° º√≠ in 1898 in Chicago and returned to her home in London, Ontario, where four other female members of her family became Bah√° º√≠s. This predominance of women converts became a feature of the Canadian Bah√° º√≠ community...\\" Statistics Canada reports 14,730 Bah√° º√≠s from 1991 census data and 18,020 in those of 2001. However the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated almost 46,600 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. Some editions of the Canadian Bah√° º√≠ News are available.Canadian Bah√° º√≠ News, Bahai.works, 2018 In 1909, the Bah√° º√≠s of the United States and Canada elected a nine-member Executive Committee for the Bahai Temple Unity, a continental consultative body formed to build the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship, in Illinois, to serve as the continental temple for North America. This group also coordinated the spread of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith across North America, and reviewed Bah√° º√≠ publications for their accuracy, and in 1925 created an official National Spiritual Assembly of the United States of America and Canada. In 1948, having grown in membership and diversity, the Bah√°‚Äô√≠ Community of Canada formed its individual National Spritual Assembly. This National Spiritual Assembly coordinates the spread of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith across Canada and reviews Bah√° º√≠ publications, publishing them through the French-English bilingual publication, √âtudes Bah√° º√≠ Studies, replaced in 1988 by the French-English-Spanish trilingual The Journal of Bah√° º√≠ Studies, both of which were published in Ottawa by agencies of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√°‚Äô√≠s of Canada. Mexico The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Mexico begins with visits of Bah√° º√≠s before 1916. In 1919 letters from the head of the religion,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, were published mentioning Mexico as one of the places Bah√° º√≠s should take the religion to. Following further pioneers moving there and making contacts the first Mexican to join the religion was in 1937, followed quickly by the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of all Latin America being elected in 1938. With continued growth the National Spiritual Assembly was first elected in 1961. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated almost 38,000 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. Central America =Belize= The Association of Religion Data Archives estimates there were 7,776 Bah√° º√≠s in Belize in 2005, or 2.5% of the national population. If correct, the Association of Religion Data Archives' estimates suggest this is the highest proportion of Bah√° º√≠s in any country. Their data also states that the Bah√° º√≠ Faith is the second most common religion in Belize, followed by Hinduism (2.0%) and Judaism (1.1%). However the 2010 Belize Population Census recorded 202 Bah√° º√≠s out of a total population of 304,106, yielding a proportion of 0.066%, not 2.5%. =Panama= Panama City, Panama The history of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Panama begins with a mention by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in the book Tablets of the Divine Plan, published in 1919; the same year, Martha Root made a trip around South America and included Panama on the return leg of the trip up the west coast. The first pioneers began to settle in Panama in 1940. The first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of Panama, in Panama City, was elected in 1946, and the National Spiritual Assembly was first elected in 1961. The Bah√° º√≠s of Panama raised a Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in 1972. In 1983 and again in 1992, some commemorative stamps were produced in Panama while the community turned its interests to the San Miguelito and Chiriqu√≠ regions of Panama with schools and a radio station. The Association of Religion Data Archives estimated there were some 41,000 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005 while another sources places it closer to 60,000.

History Cabrillo SMR is one of 36 marine protected areas added by the California Fish and Game Commission in December, 2010 during the third phase of the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative. The MLPAI is a collaborative public process to create a statewide network of protected areas along California‚Äôs coastline. The south coast‚Äôs new MPAs were designed by local divers, fishermen, conservationists and scientists who comprised the South Coast Regional Stakeholder Group. Their job was to design a network of protected areas that would preserve sensitive sea life and habitats while enhancing recreation, study and education opportunities. The south coast marine protected areas went into effect in 2012. Geography  Boundary: This area is bounded by the mean high tide line and straight lines connecting the following points in the order listed: # # # # and # . Habitat and wildlife Cabrillo SMR includes a section of Point Loma‚Äôs dense and thriving kelp forest. Rocky and sandy beach and intertidal habitat, surf grass, and nearshore rock reefs are other habitats. It is adjacent and contiguous with Cabrillo National Monument, which protects and interprets for the public important California history and culture, including the site of Juan Cabrillo‚Äôs journey to North America. This unique opportunity enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of managing the MPA through collaborative science, resources management and protection, law enforcement, education and outreach. Scientific monitoring As specified by the Marine Life Protection Act, select marine protected areas along California‚Äôs south coast are monitored by scientists to track their effectiveness and learn more about ocean health. Similar studies in MPAs located off of the Santa Barbara Channel Islands have detected gradual improvements in fish size and number.

The series premiered on Lifetime on October 6, 2013, and ended on October 5, 2014, after two seasons. Set in the fictional seaside town of East End, it follows the lives of a family of witches ‚Äì Joanna Beauchamp (Julia Ormond) and her two grown-up daughters, Freya Beauchamp (Jenna Dewan Tatum) and Ingrid Beauchamp (Rachel Boston), as well as her sister Wendy Beauchamp (M√§dchen Amick). On November 22, 2013, Lifetime renewed Witches of East End for a second season to consist of 13 episodes, which premiered on July 6, 2014. On November 4, 2014, Lifetime cancelled Witches of East End after a decline in ratings during the second season. The series finale aired on October 5, 2014. Overview The series stars Julia Ormond as lead character Joanna Beauchamp, a witch and mother of Freya Beauchamp (Jenna Dewan) and Ingrid Beauchamp (Rachel Boston), who are part of the next generation of witches. M√§dchen Amick co-stars as Joanna's mischievous witch sister Wendy Beauchamp. The series is loosely based on the book's plot, with one change being that Freya and Ingrid are initially unaware of their magical powers. Cast, people, and characters *Julia Ormond as Joanna Beauchamp *M√§dchen Amick as Wendy Beauchamp *Jenna Dewan as Freya Beauchamp *Rachel Boston as Ingrid Beauchamp *Daniel Di Tomasso as Killian Gardiner *Eric Winter as Dash Gardiner *Christian Cooke as Frederick Beauchamp (season 2) Notes: a Guest in pilot, starring from episode 2 onwards. Development and production On July 19, 2012, it was announced that Lifetime had ordered a pilot for Witches of East End for its 2013 season, and that the show would be executive-produced by both Maggie Friedman and Erwin Stoff, and produced by Fox 21. On January 31, 2013, it was revealed that Lifetime had picked up Witches of East End with ten episodes and that it was scheduled to premiere later that year. The executive VP of programming for Lifetime Networks, Rob Sharenow, said \\"We've been thrilled about Witches of East End and its powerful premise since the moment we bought the property, and our friends at Fox 21 helped develop it for television. This is one of the most exciting ensemble casts we've seen and the whole show is fresh, original and just right for Lifetime.\\" =Casting= On August 30, 2012, it was announced that Julia Ormond had landed a main role on the show, as Joanna Beauchamp. On September 14, 2012, the role of Freya Beauchamp was officially given to Jenna Dewan Tatum, who publicly announced on December 17, 2012, that she and husband Channing Tatum were expecting their first child. On September 17, 2012, the leading male role of Dash Gardiner was assigned to Patrick Heusinger. And on September 19, 2012, Rachel Boston and model Daniel Di Tomasso were announced to have earned the two remaining main roles, respectively Ingrid Beauchamp and Killian Gardiner. Finally, as announced on September 25, 2012, Nicholas Gonzalez would portray detective Matt Torcoletti. On October 9, 2012, two guest star announcements were made: M√§dchen Amick, who then became a part of the permanent main cast, and Glenne Headly - Amick as Wendy (Joanna's sister) and a leading role and Headly as Penelope (the Gardiner brothers' mother). Tom Lenk was later given the role of Hudson Rafferty, Ingrid's best friend, as announced on October 16, 2012. The original casting underwent subsequent changes. As revealed by Nicholas Gonzalez himself on his Twitter account, a few days after the pick-up announcement, the actor was dropped from the show, and on June 6, 2013, it was announced that Patrick Heusinger's role as Dash Gardiner would be recast, for creative reasons. On June 26, TVLine revealed that Eric Winter would replace Patrick Heusinger as Dash Gardiner. On July 9, the recurring role of the detective Adam (formerly Matt Torcoletti) was assigned to Jason George. On July 12, Virginia Madsen replaced Glenne Headly for a multi-episode arc as Penelope, Dash and Killian's mother. On August 12, Freddie Prinze, Jr. booked a guest role on the show, as Leo Wingate, with a possibility that it could become recurring. On August 14, Anthony Lemke was cast as recurring Harrison Welles. =Filming= Filming the pilot episode began on October 16, 2012, in the port town of Wilmington, North Carolina, where several scenes were shot. On October 29, 2012, the crew moved for a week to Macon, Georgia, where they filmed the wedding scenes for the pilot at the historical Hay House. When the network Lifetime announced Witches of East End was going to be a series, it was also revealed that filming for the rest of the series would happen in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, instead of continuing to be filmed in Wilmington. Maggie Friedman announced on Twitter on June 10 that she was scouting locations for the series, trying to \\"find Fair Haven\\". Reception =Critical reception= Critical reaction to Witches of East End has been mixed, with a score of 50 on Metacritic and 70% for the first season on Rotten Tomatoes with a consensus saying \\"Although it's ridiculously soapy, Witches of East End is often campy fun; it's a supernatural spectacle that's entertaining despite its silliness.\\" Lori Rackl of Chicago Sun-Times described the show as a \\"Soapy, silly adaptation of Melissa de la Cruz's best-seller.\\" Matthew Gilbert of Boston Globe reviewed the show saying \\"[It] will remain a missable new supernatural series populated by wooden actors and feeble plotlines.\\" Matt Roush of TV Guide summed up his review saying \\"Whatever the opposite of spellbinding is, that's this show.\\" Diane Werts of Newsday gave the show a more positive review, saying \\"What's utterly clear is that the starter hour picks up steam whenever loose-cannon Amick bops around  although Ormond does a nice job of grounding its shenanigans in a semblance of reality.\\" She finishes her review giving the pilot a B rating. Allison Keene from The Hollywood Reporter also praised the premiere, claiming \\"Witches of East End is up against a number of other supernatural shows, and there becomes a question of saturation. Fortunately or unfortunately, we aren't at that point, yet. It seems there's plenty more room at the table, and there, Witches of East End currently looks like the most fun.\\" Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times also gave the show a glowing review, starting off by negatively reviewing the \\"humorless\\" witches on shows such as the 2013 debuts of Sleepy Hollow and The Originals, then going on to say Witches of East End is a welcome relief to those series. He further applauds the casting and characters, saying \\"thanks to zippy repartee among the stars. Ms. Amick is hilarious, and Ms. Dewan Tatum and Ms. Boston make a pretty amusing pair of mismatched sisters.\\" He ends the review with \\"there is a lot of heavy fare on television on Sunday nights. If Witches can retain its wry tone, it will be a satisfying alternative for viewers looking for a lighter way to end the weekend.\\" Lily Moayeri of Under the Radar compared the show with Charmed saying \\"Witch-themed shows work better when both the witches and the target audience are teenagers. The grown-up witches on Witches of East End are just a little too ridiculous-even more so than the witch sister trio of Charmed.\\" The show's second season currently has a 90% user rating on Rotten Tomatoes. =Ratings= Witches of East End premiered on a Sunday night to 1.93 million viewers and a 0.7 18-49 rating. The premiere rated on par to the June 23 premiere of Lifetime's other new show Devious Maids; however, Witches of East End ended the night being the number two scripted drama on cable, behind Boardwalk Empire on HBO. The following week, Witches of East End pulled a total of 1.93 million viewers and rose to a 0.8 18-49 rating, despite the return of The Walking Dead and its talk show Talking Dead breaking records on AMC.

Cancellation and fan campaign On November 4, 2014, it was announced that Lifetime had cancelled Witches of East End after a decline in ratings during the second season. The first season averaged 1.67 million viewers, but dropped in its second season to 1.13 million. After its cancellation, fans launched an online petition campaign to save the show called \\"Renew Witches of East End\\". The petition became popular on Twitter, where fans were told to use the hashtag #RenewWitchesofEastEnd and tweet it to Lifetime's Twitter account. Fans have also campaigned the online streaming service Netflix to pick up the show. The campaign received support from celebrities on Twitter who backed the show to be renewed, including Channing Tatum, William Shatner and Snooki as well as stars from cult television series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayers Sarah Michelle Gellar and Charmeds Shannen Doherty and Holly Marie Combs. As of December 2019 and after 5 years since the finale, the petition has received more than 280,000 signatures.

In a racing career which lasted from October 1987 until October 1988 he ran seven times and won three races. After winning his only race as a two-year-old in 1987, Doyoun produced his most impressive performance on his three-year-old debut when he defeated Warning in the Craven Stakes. He won the 2000 Guineas on his next appearance but failed to win again, although he did finish third in The Derby. He was retired to stud at the end of the season, and after a slow start to his breeding career, sired several important winners including Daylami and Kalanisi. He died in Turkey in 2002. Background Doyoun was a \\"handsome\\" dark-coated bay horse bred by his owner the Aga Khan. His dam Dumka won the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches for the Aga Knah in 1974 and went on to become a highly successful broodmare. Her other winners included Dalsaan (Hungerford Stakes), Dolpour (Gordon Richards Stakes) and Dafayna (Cork and Orrery Stakes). He was one of many major winners sired by the American-bred Epsom Derby winner Mill Reef who was the Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1978 and 1987. Doyoun was sent into training with Michael Stoute, who had trained the Aga Khan's Derby winners Shergar and Shahrastani, at his Beech Hurst Stables in Newmarket, Suffolk. He was ridden in all his races by the Irish jockey Walter Swinburn. Racing career =1987:two-year-old season= On his only appearance as a two-year-old in 1987 Doyoun won the Westley Maiden Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in autumn. Despite its modest status and prize money, the Westley has been won by many horses who went on to major success including Shadeed and Barathea. =1988:three-year- old season= On his three-year-old debut, Doyoun appeared at Newmarket in April for the Craven Stakes, a trial race for the 2000 Guineas in which he was matched against Warning, the previous season's top-rated two-year-old. Starting the 100/30 second favourite, Doyoun took the lead two furlongs from the finish and drew clear in the closing stages to win by four lengths from the previously undefeated Warning. Two weeks after his win in the Craven, Doyoun faced eight opponents in the 2000 Guineas over the same course and distance. With Warning and several other leading contenders having been withdrawn, the field for the race was considered to be lacking in quality and Doyoun was made the 4/5 favourite. Swinburn tracked the leaders before sending the colt into the lead two furlongs out, but on this occasion he was unable to break clear of the field and was \\"all out\\" to hold off the challenge of Charmer by half a length. On 1 June, Doyoun was stepped up in distance to contest the Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom. He was the 9/1 fourth choice in the betting, behind Red Glow, Unfuwain and Minster Son, just ahead of the Aga Khan's other runner Kahyasi. Doyoun turned into the straight in fifth place, but although he made some progress he was unable to reach the lead and finished third behind Kahyasi and Glacial Storm, beaten a total of three lengths. Racing on softer ground in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot in July, Doyoun weakened in the closing stages and finished sixth of the ten runners behind Mtoto. The colt reverted to a mile in August and finished third behind the four-year-old Prince Rupert in the Waterford Crystal Mile at Goodwood. On his final appearance, Doyoun ran over ten furlongs in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in October, and finished third to the filly Indian Skimmer, beaten seven lengths. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Doyoun a \\"poor\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. While admitting that he was not the best of classic winners, Michael Stoute called Doyoun \\"very honest and a joy to train\\", whilst Walter Swinburn described him as \\"a really tough, gutsy racehorse\\". Stud record Doyoun stood as a stallion at the Aga Khan's Ballymany and Gilltown Stud in Ireland until 1998 when he was sold and exported to Turkey. His reputation as a sire of winners grew following his departure as his sons Daylami and Kalanisi won the Breeders' Cup Turf in 1999 and 2000 respectively. Despite being trained in Europe, both horses were voted American Champion Male Turf Horse at the Eclipse Awards. Following his success, attempts were made to buy the horse back, but his owners, the Turkish Jockey Club, refused to sell. His other progeny included Manntari, Margarula and the Manhattan Handicap winner Manndar. Doyoun died of intestinal cancer at the Izmit Central Covering Station near Istanbul on 5 December 2002.

Regular radio broadcasting, in Arabic, first started in 1955. By 1980, the radio service broadcast up to 14 hours a day. The country's first English language radio station started in 1977, as a result of an increase in English speakers in Bahrain and the Persian Gulf region. The radio's programs were primarily religious and educational, with occasional news announcements. Almost all radio stations in Bahrain are state-owned, by the Bahrain Radio and Television Corporation. However, Radio Mrichi 104.2FM is a privately-owned radio station broadcasting in Hindi/Malayalam, to serve the country's Indian community. History The British established the Bahrain Broadcasting Station in November 1940 in response to the initiation of pro-Nazi programmes being broadcast in Arabic in the Persian Gulf from 1934 to 1945. One of the earliest studies done on radio use in Bahrain assert that in 1940, there were 511 radio receivers in operation. However, radio ownership was not common among the residents, and most people went to caf√©s to listen to broadcasts. The station was staffed mostly with Bahrainis and its broadcasts included Quranic recitations, the national anthems of Kuwait and Bahrain, and poetry recitations, which may have been in the form of music. The station was closed down in 1945. Radio Bahrain was established in 1955. The Bahrain Radio and Television Corporation (BRTC), a state-owned entity, was set up in 1971, and runs Radio Bahrain as well as Bahrain TV. BRTC became an independent body in January 1993. Its radio broadcasts are usually in Arabic and also in English. The English-language radio service has been on-air since 1977, broadcasting four hours a day from a studio in Isa Town. In 1982 the station was moved to a building in Adliya. On-air time was extended to 18 hours a day. A second station, Radio 2, began broadcasting 6 hours a day. In 1989 a new studio was established in the Ministry of Information building, and the following year the station went 24 hours. In 2007, Radio Bahrain switched its frequency from 101.0FM to 99.5FM. The Information Affairs Authority was formed in 2010 and, besides other functions, controls BRTC. In addition, 'Your FM' is an Indian language radio station primarily serving listeners from the Indian sub continent.

The film premiered at the Rotterdam Film Festival on January 1, 2013, and was released in Japan on May 18 that same year. A 12 episode drama, titled Kuroyuri Danchi ~Josho~ follows events leading up to those that take place in the film. It began airing in Japan on April 9, 2013. In May 2018, the series was released in the United States on Toku. Plot A young nursing student, Asuka Ninomiya (Atsuko Maeda) moves to a dilapidated apartment complex with her father, Isao; mother, Sachiko (Naomi Nishida); and younger brother, Satoshi. She tries to greet her elderly next door neighbor, Shinozaki, but with little success, and befriends a local boy named Minoru Kinoshita, whose only guardian is Shinozaki. Asuka begins to experience strange things, including scratching noises and the sound of a loud alarm clock, both of which come from Shinozaki's flat. She is also wary of her own family, who seem to be doing the same activity and repeating the same conversation everyday. Asuka later discovers that Shinozaki had died while scratching the wall, explaining the noises she heard every night. A detective tells her that he had been dead for three days without anyone finding him. Since then, Asuka feels that Shinozaki haunts her in anger for not finding him earlier. When a cleanup team arrives to clean Shinozaki's flat, Asuka becomes acquainted with Shinobu Sasahara (Hiroki Narimiya), a cleaner with experiences in the supernatural who tells her that the living and the dead reside in two separate times: the living move forward in time, while the dead stop at the time they died. Asuka consults with Sasahara about Shinozaki's haunting and is told that he can contact a psychic friend of his. Returning home, Asuka is greeted by a completely empty home and no family and becomes hysterical. Sasahara learns from Asuka's foster parents that Asuka's entire family had died from a bus accident years ago with Asuka as the only survivor; since then, Asuka has been blaming herself, refusing to move on. Sasahara invites his psychic friend, Sanae Nonomura, who concludes that Asuka is not haunted by Shinozaki - he only wanted to say thank you for discovering him and warn her that she is in danger. She is actually being haunted by Minoru, a boy from the apartment complex who died 13 years ago when he hid inside a trash bin during a hide-and-seek game and was incinerated. Asuka becomes withdrawn and depressed, refusing to move out even when Sasahara begs her to. She continues to play with Minoru, seeing him as a replacement for her dead little brother. Sasahara and Nonomura force her to allow the latter conduct an exorcism to expel Minoru's spirit from inhabiting Asuka's damaged mind. Sasahara forces Asuka not to let Minoru enter the flat even when Minoru projects her family's last memories, but he himself is lured into Minoru's trap when Minoru projects his vegetative girlfriend, Hitomi Makimura (Megumi Sato), who is in a coma. He lets Minoru in, killing Nonomura in the process. Asuka agrees to become Minoru's playmate in exchange for Sasahara's life, but Sasahara pushes her away, and gets himself thrown into a memory of Minoru's trash bin, where he is burned alive. Asuka, found scratching and screaming at her apartment floor, is taken back by her foster parents. Despite their insistence, she continues to babble about her dead parents and brother while clutching her brother's doll.

Bah√° º√≠ sources usually estimate the worldwide Bah√° º√≠ population to be above 5 million. Most encyclopedias and similar sources estimate between 5 and 6 million Bah√° º√≠s in the world in the early 21st century. The religion is almost entirely contained in a single, organized, hierarchical community, but the Bah√° º√≠ population is spread out into almost every country and ethnicity in the world, being recognized as the second-most geographically widespread religion after Christianity. See Bah√° º√≠ statistics. Early history The Bah√° º√≠ Faith was introduced into South America in 1919 when Martha Root made an extended trip to Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Peru. She introduced the Bah√° º√≠ Faith to Esperantists and Theosophical groups and visited local newspapers to ask them to publish articles about the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. The first Bah√° º√≠ permanently resident in South America was Leonora Armstrong, who arrived in Brazil in 1921. The first Seven Year Plan (1937‚Äì44), an international plan organized by then head of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bah√° º√≠s the goal of establishing the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in every country in Latin America (that is, settling at least one Bah√° º√≠ or converting at least one native). In 1950, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of South America was first elected, and then in 1957 this Assembly was split into two ‚Äì basically northern/eastern South America with the Republics of Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, in Lima, Peru and one of the western/southern South America with the Republics of Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia in Buenos Aires, Argentina. By 1963, most countries in South America had their own National Spiritual Assembly. Later developments Among the more significant developments across South and Central America for the religion has been the building of the last continental Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in Chile, a program of developing Bah√° º√≠ radio stations in several countries, relationships with indigenous populations, development programs like FUNDAEC, and the Ruhi institute process began in Colombia. =House of Worship in Chile= The House of Worship in Santiago, Chile In late 2002, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of Chile and the Universal House of Justice, the international governing body of the Bah√° º√≠s, announced a competition for the design of the first Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship for South America, to be built near Santiago () though the general decision to have the first temple of South America was set since 1953. The selected design was designed by Siamak Hariri of Toronto, Canada, and fabrication of components began in 2007. The temple was inaugurated in 2016. Its sides are composed of translucent panels of alabaster and cast glass. The interior structure is a lattice structure of steel supporting the inside of the upper dome. =Bah√° º√≠ radio= Since the 1960s there has been interest in mass media to promote and support development projects. This was followed by a view that the service of the community of the religion was through the participation of the community and spread of information. At a series of UNESCO conferences Bah√° º√≠s consulted and the consensus of opinion lead to advancing the issues until in 1978 a conference was held in Ecuador. At that conference researchers summarized developments along these lines and noted challenges such projects faced and a few ways such projects failed while also noting that village radio stations seemed to be a nice fit because of the necessary quality of communication in a society. The Bah√° º√≠ Radio project in Ecuador served as a means to study the process of the two trends by setting up a community radio station of the community for the community - and may have been the first such project in all Latin America aimed at serving the campesinos as its primary purpose with development oriented programming. It mixed national music forms with public service features (lost and found, messages to individuals, official communications, but looking to develop more.) The project was studied through faculty from Northwestern University from 1980‚Äì1982, and briefly in 1983, and reviewed Bah√° º√≠ Radio projects in Peru and Bolivia as well and resulted in a PhD by Kurt John Hein in 1985 following which he took up service at WLGI Radio Bah√° º√≠. Since 1977, Bah√° º√≠s have established several radio stations worldwide, particularly in South America. Programmes broadcast may include local news, music, topics related to socio-economic and community development, educational programmes focusing on indigenous language and culture, and Bah√° º√≠ introductory and deepening material. =Indigenous peoples= The Bah√° º√≠ Faith and Native Americans has a history reaching back to the lifetime of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, the head of the religion near the turn of the 20th century and has multiplied its relationships across the Americas. Individuals have joined the religion and institutions have been founded to serve Native Americans and have Native Americans serve on Bah√° º√≠ institutions. By 1963 Bah√° º√≠ sources claim members of some 83 tribes of Native Americans had joined the religion. Among the Central and South American indigenous there are substantial populations of native Bah√° º√≠s. An informal summary of the Wayuu ( a tribe living in La Guajira Desert) community in 1971 showed about 1000 Bah√° º√≠s. The largest population of Bah√° º√≠s in South America is in Bolivia, a country whose population is estimated to be 55%‚Äì70% indigenous and 30%‚Äì42% Mestizo, with a Bah√° º√≠ population estimated at 206,000 in 2005 according to the Association of Religion Data Archives. Relationships between North American and South American Indian populations have been fostered by North American Indians. The idea for a Trail of Light occurred during preparations for the first Bah√° º√≠ Native Council in 1978. Another inspiration for the Trail of Light was the concept of promulgating the religion among the indigenous peoples in the Pacific Rim that was described by the Hand of the Cause Rahm√°tu'llah Muh√°jir in 1978. The Trail of Light, also known as Camino del Sol, was defined as a process whereby native Bah√° º√≠s engaged with diverse native peoples about a number of issues including promulgating their religion as well as organizing councils for the people and encouraged discovery of mutual cultural links across the native peoples. The first Trail of Light traveling trip by 22 members of the religion occurred spontaneously immediately after the council. In 1985 the Trail of Light project began its work in Colombia. =FUNDAEC= FUNDAEC, the acronym in Spanish for ‚ÄúThe Foundation for the Application and Teaching of the Sciences‚Äù, is a non-profit, non-governmental organization that focuses on training and development in the rural areas of Colombia and other countries in Latin America. It was created in 1974 in Colombia by a group of scientists and professionals led by Farzam Arbab then a visiting professor to the University of Valle in 1970. In 1974 FUNDAEC was initiated as a Colombian NGO based on Bah√° º√≠ consultations with Colombians starting in the 1970s which developed a number of projects like a secondary curriculum centered on skill development for living in the countryside and minimized urbanization for example. According to Gustav Correa, director of FUNDAEC in 2002, it was originally inspired by a quotation from Bah√° ºu'll√°h - \\"Baha'u'llah talks about man as 'a mine rich in gems of inestimable value.' He says that 'education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom'. Its founding ideals included not seeing the people as masses of undernourished people, overwhelmed by problems and needs-housing, employment, sanitation, education, but instead to consider the participants of its programs as irreplaceable resources in a self-sustaining process of change. FUNDAEC was officially instituted as a private development foundation based in Cali, and has developed a number of development projects centered around a goal that rural populations should not only benefit from higher education, but should also actively participate in creating and generating knowledge and technologies, to improve their quality of life and standard of living FUNDAEC sought to dispel the image of the poor farmer whose life must be planned and managed by more privileged members of society. =Ruhi institute= The Ruhi Institute is an educational institution, operating under the guidance of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Colombia. The general idea of an institute in Bah√° º√≠ terms originates with the beginning of the Nine Year Plan (starting in 1964) designated by the Universal House of Justice. The institute or training institute was especially for countries where large-scale expansion was taking place to meet the needs of the thousands who were entering the religion. At that time, the emphasis was on acquiring a physical facility to which group after group of newly enrolled believers would be invited to attend deepening courses. Over the years, in conjunction with these institutes as well as independent of them, a number of courses‚Äîreferred to, for example, as weekend institutes, five-day institutes, and nine-day institutes‚Äî were developed for the purpose of promulgating the fundamental verities of the religion and how to serve it. Since its founding the program of courses developed first in Colombia has been adopted for work around the world and across age groups and studied in a variety of applications. By country =Bolivia= The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Bolivia begins with references to the country in Bah√° º√≠ literature as early as 1916. The first Bah√° º√≠ to arrive in Bolivia was in 1940 through the beginning of the arrival of coordinated pioneers, people who chose to move for the growth of the religion, from the United States. That same year the first Bolivian joined the religion. The first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in La Paz in 1945 and the first Indian formally joined the religion in 1956 which soon spread widely among that subculture. The community elected an independent National Spiritual Assembly in 1961. By 1963 there were hundreds of local assemblies. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith is currently the largest international religious minority in Bolivia. The largest population of Bah√° º√≠s in South America is in Bolivia, a country whose general population is estimated to be 55%-70% indigenous and 30%-42% Mestizo, with a Bah√° º√≠ population estimated at 217000 in 2005 according to the Association of Religion Data Archives. =Brazil= The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Brazil started in 1919 with Bah√° º√≠s first visiting the country that year, and the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly in Brazil was established in 1928. There followed a period of growth with the arrival of coordinated pioneers from the United States finding national Brazilian converts and in 1961 an independent national Bah√° º√≠ community was formed. During the 1992 Earth Summit, which was held in Brazil, the international and local Bah√° º√≠ community were given the responsibility for organizing a series of different programs, and since then the involvements of the Bah√° º√≠ community in the country have continued to multiply. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 42211 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. =Chile= The Bah√° º√≠ Faith was first mentioned Chile in Bah√° º√≠ sources as early as 1916, with Bah√° º√≠s visiting as early as 1919 but the community wasn't founded in Chile until 1940 with the beginning of the arrival of coordinated pioneers from the United States finding national Chilean converts and achieved an independent national community in 1963. In 2002 this community was picked for the establishment of the first Bah√° º√≠ Temple of South America which the community is still prosecuting. The permanent Chilean Bah√° º√≠ community dates from the arrival of Marcia Stewart Atwater, born in 1904 in Pasadena, California, who arrived in Chile on 7 December 1940. The first Chilean to accept the Bah√° º√≠ Faith was 12-year-old Paul Bravo, which was followed by his family becoming Bah√° º√≠s. Then in 1943, Chile's first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly was elected. Following the election of the Regional Bah√° º√≠ Spiritual Assembly of South America in 1950, Chile established its independent Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly in 1961. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 26000 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. =Colombia= The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Colombia begins with references to the country in Bah√° º√≠ literature as early as 1916, with Bah√° º√≠s visiting as early as 1927. The first Colombian joined the religion in 1929 and the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in Bogot√° in 1944 with the beginning of the arrival of coordinated pioneers from the United States and achieved an independent National Spiritual Assembly in 1961. By 1963 there were eleven local assemblies. In the 1980s institutions were developed in Colombia that have influenced activities inside and independent of the religion in other countries: FUNDAEC and the Ruhi Institute. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 70000 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. =Guyana= The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Guyana was first mentioned in Bah√° º√≠ sources as early as 1916, the first Bah√° º√≠s visited as early as 1927 but the community was founded in Guyana in 1953 with the beginning of the arrival of coordinated pioneers and from Guyanese converts. The community elected the first Bah√° º√≠Local Spiritual Assembly in 1955 and an independent National Spiritual Assembly in 1977. The country has experienced large migrations and the size of the Bah√° º√≠ community has also dramatically changed. In the most recent cycle the 2002 national census showed about 0.1%, or 500, Bah√° º√≠s mostly in three of its Regions though Bah√° º√≠s were noted in every Region. However, by 2005 the Association of Religion Data Archives estimated there were some 13,000 Bah√° º√≠s. Bah√° º√≠s are now widely distributed across Guyana and represent all major racial groups and regions. The Bah√° º√≠ community, while relatively small, is well known for its emphasis on unity, non-involvement in politics and its work in issues such as literacy and youth issues. =Paraguay= The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Paraguay begins after  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, then head of the religion, mentioned the country in 1916. Paraguayan Maria Casati was the first to join the religion in 1939 when living in Buenos Aires. The first pioneer to settle in Paraguay was Elizabeth Cheney late in 1940 and the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of Asunci√≥n was elected in 1944. By 1961 Paraguayan Bah√° º√≠s had elected the first National Spiritual Assembly and by 1963 there were 3 local assemblies plus other communities. Recent estimates of Bah√° º√≠s mention 5500 or 10,600 though the state Census doesn't mention the Bah√° º√≠s. =Peru= The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Peru begins with references to Peru in Bah√° º√≠ literature as early as 1916, with the firstBah√° º√≠s visiting as early as 1919. A functioning community wasn't founded in Peru until the 1930s with the beginning of the arrival of coordinated pioneers from the United States which progressed into finding national Peruvian converts and achieved an independent national community in 1961. The Association of Religion Data Archives(relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 41,900 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. =Uruguay= The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Uruguay begins after  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, then head of the religion, mentioned the country in 1916. The first Bah√° º√≠ to enter the country was Martha Root in 1919. The first pioneer to settle there was Wilfrid Barton early in 1940 and the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly of Montevideo was elected in 1942. By 1961 Uruguayan Bah√° º√≠s had elected the first National Spiritual Assembly and by 1963 there were three Local Assemblies plus other communities. Circa 2001 there was an estimated 4,000 Bah√° º√≠s in Uruguay. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 7,300 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005.

Following the failure of the coup, law and order broke down in Mosul, which witnessed several days of violent street battles between various groups attempting to use the chaos to settle political and personal scores. Background During Qasim's term, there was much debate over whether Iraq should join the United Arab Republic, led by Gamal Abdel Nasser. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan had dissolved the Arab Federation after Qasim had the entire royal family in Iraq put to death, along with Prime Minister Nuri al-Said. Qasim's growing ties with the Iraqi Communist Party provoked a rebellion in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul which was led by Arab nationalists in charge of military units. In an attempt to intimidate any individuals plotting a potential coup, Qasim had encouraged a Communist backed Peace Partisans rally in Mosul that was held on 6 March 1959. Some 250,000 Peace Partisans and Communists thronged Mosul's streets on 6 March, and although the rally passed peacefully, by 7 March, skirmishes had broken out between the Communists and the nationalists. This degenerated into a local civil war over the following days. Attempted coup Qasim's attempt to stop dissent was successful to some extent, as Colonel Abdel Wahab Shawaf, the stocky 40-year-old Arab nationalist Commander of the Iraqi Army's Mosul Garrison, was discomforted by the Communists' show of force. Following clashes between the Communist Party's Popular Resistance Militia and local Nasserites which culminated in the burning down of a Nasserite restaurant, Shawaf phoned Baghdad to ask for permission to use the soldiers under his command to keep order. Shawaf was given an ambiguous response by Baghdad. So Shawaf decided to try and carry out a coup d'√©tat on 7 March. Shawaf was supported in this endeavour by other disgruntled Free Officers, who were primarily from prominent Arab Sunni families and who opposed Qasim's growing relationship with the Iraqi Communist Party.Iraqi Revolution and Coups Shawaf ordered the fifth brigade, which was under his command, to round up 300 members of the Communist Peace Partisans, including their leader, Kamil Kazanchi, a well known Baghdad lawyer and politician, who was executed. Shawaf sent word to other northern Iraqi Army commanders in an effort to convince them to join his attempted coup. He kidnapped a British technician and portable radio transmitter from the Iraq Petroleum Company and took over Radio Mosul, which he attempted to use to encourage Iraqis to rise up against Qasim. Shawaf also sent word to sympathetic local tribesmen, including the Shammar, of whom thousands then travelled to Mosul to show their support. On the morning of 8 March, Shawaf sent two Furies to Baghdad on an aerial bombing raid. The crew of the aircraft had been ordered to bomb the headquarters of Radio Baghdad. The raid was a failure, with the planes doing little damage. In response, Qasim sent four Iraqi Air Force planes to attack Shawaf's headquarters, situated on a bluff above Mosul. The attack on the headquarters killed six or seven officers, and wounded Shawaf. Whilst Shawaf was bandaging himself, he was killed by one of his sergeants who believed the coup had failed. Ensuing violence Although Shawaf was dead, the violence was not yet over. Mosul soon became a scene of score settling between rebel and loyalist soldiers, alongside Communists and Arab nationalists. Bedouin tribesmen who had been called on by Shawaf prior to his death to support the coup also engaged in pillaging, and the violence within Mosul was also used as a cover by some to settle private scores. Shawaf's body was beaten and dragged through the streets of Mosul before being thrown in a car and taken to Baghdad. Three pro- government Kurdish tribes moved into Mosul and fought the Arab Shammar tribesmen, their long time opponents who had rallied around Shawaf. Sheik Ahmed Ajil, the chief of the Shammars was spotted by Kurdish militiamen in his car and was killed, along with his driver, and both were later hung naked from a bridge over the Tigris. By the fourth day government troops had begun to impose order and began clearing the roads as well as removing naked and mutilated bodies which had been strung up from lamp posts. The total dead was estimated at approximately 500. Aftermath Although the rebellion was crushed by the military, it had a number of adverse effects that was to affect Qasim's position. First, it increased the power of the communists. Second, it encouraged the ideas of the Ba‚Äôath Party's (which had been steadily growing since the 14 July coup). The Ba‚Äôath Party believed that the only way of halting the engulfing tide of communism was to assassinate Qasim. Of the 16 members of Qasim's cabinet, 12 of them were Ba'ath Party members. However, the party turned against Qasim due to his refusal to join Gamel Abdel Nasser's United Arab Republic. To strengthen his own position within the government, Qasim created an alliance with the Iraqi Communist Party, which was opposed to any notion of pan-Arabism. By later that year, the Ba'ath Party leadership was planning to assassinate Qasim. Saddam Hussein was a leading member of the operation. At the time, the Ba'ath Party was more of an ideological experiment then a strong anti-government fighting machine. The majority of its members were either educated professionals or students, and Saddam fitted in well. The choice of Saddam was, according to historian Con Coughlin, \\"hardly surprising\\". The idea of assassinating Qasim may have been Nasser's, and there is speculation that some of those who participated in the operation received training in Damascus, which was then part of the UAR. However, \\"no evidence has ever been produced to implicate Nasser directly in the plot.\\" The assassins planned to ambush Qasim at Al-Rashid Street on 7 October 1959: one man was to kill those sitting at the back of the car, the rest killing those in front. During the ambush it is claimed that Saddam began shooting prematurely, which disorganised the whole operation. Qasim's chauffeur was killed, and Qasim was hit in the arm and shoulder. The assassins believed they had killed him and quickly retreated to their headquarters, but Qasim survived. The growing influence of communism was felt throughout 1959. A communist-sponsored purge of the armed forces was carried out in the wake of the Mosul revolt. The Iraqi cabinet began to shift towards the radical-left as several communist sympathisers gained posts in the cabinet. Iraq's foreign policy began to reflect this communist influence, as Qasim removed Iraq from the Baghdad Pact on 24 March, and later fostered closer ties with the USSR, including extensive economic agreements.Marr, Phebe; ‚ÄúThe Modern History of Iraq‚Äù, page 164 However communist successes encouraged attempts to expand on their position. The communists attempted to replicate their success at Mosul in similar fashion at Kirkuk. A rally was called for 14 July. This was intended to intimidate conservative elements. Instead, it resulted in widespread bloodshed. Qasim consequently cooled relations with the communists signalling a reduction (although by no means a cessation) of their influence in the Iraqi government. Qasim and his supporters accused the UAR of having supported the rebels, and the uprising resulted in an intensification of the ongoing Iraq-UAR propaganda war, with the UAR press accusing Qasim of having sold out the ideas of Arab nationalism. The disagreements between Qasim and Cairo also highlighted the fact that the UAR had failed to become the single voice of Arab nationalism, and the UAR had to recognize that many Iraqis were unwilling to recognise Cairo's leadership, thereby revealing the limits of Nasser's power to other Arab governments. Extent of UAR involvement Although the attempted coup may have been driven in part by Arab nationalist sentiment and a desire to join the United Arab Republic, the exact extent of UAR involvement in the coup has largely been unclear. Shawaf kept in close contact with the UAR during the development of the attempted coup, with some claiming that the UAR ambassador in Baghdad acted as an intermediary between the UAR and the rebels. There is also evidence that suggests that Radio Mosul may have been transmitting from the Syrian side of the border.

Bah√° º√≠ sources usually estimate the worldwide Bah√° º√≠ population to be above 5 million. Most encyclopedias and similar sources estimate between 5 and 6 million Bah√° º√≠s in the world in the early 21st century. The religion is almost entirely contained in a single, organized, hierarchical community, but the Bah√° º√≠ population is spread out into almost every country and ethnicity in the world, being recognized as the second-most geographically widespread religion after Christianity. See Bah√° º√≠ statistics. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith originated in Qajar Persia, and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Since the middle of the 20th century, growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries, because the Bah√° º√≠ Faith's activities in many Muslim-majority countries has been severely persecuted and suppressed by authorities. Comparatively mild troubles exist in other countries like Pakistan, Iraq, and Indonesia, where the Bah√° º√≠ Faith is legal and only somewhat restricted. Afghanistan The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Afghanistan began in 1880s with visits by Bah√° º√≠s. However, it wasn't until the 1930s any Bah√° º√≠ settled there. A Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1948 in Kabul and after some years was re-elected in 1969. Though the population had perhaps reached thousands, under the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the harsh rule of the Taliban the Bah√° º√≠s lost the right to have any institutions and many fled. According to a 2007 estimate, the Bah√° º√≠s in Afghanistan number approximately 400. However, the Association of Religion Data Archives estimated there were some 15000 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. Bangladesh The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Bangladesh begins previous to its independence when it was part of India. The roots of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in the region go back to the first days of the B√°b√≠ religion in 1844. During Bah√° ºu'll√°h's lifetime, as founder of the religion, he encouraged some of his followers to move to India. And it may have been Jam√°l Effendi who was first sent and stopped in Dhaka more than once. The first Bah√° º√≠s in the area that would later become Bangladesh was when a Bengali group from Chittagong accepted the religion while in Burma. By 1950 there were enough members of the religion to elect Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assemblies in Chittagong and Dhaka. The community has contributed to the progress of the nation of Bangladesh individually and collectively and in 2005 the World Christian Encyclopedia estimated the Bah√° º√≠ population of Bangladesh about 10600. Cambodia A sign in Battambang, in an area with a high concentration of Bah√° º√≠ followers. The introduction of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Cambodia first occurred in the 1920s, not long after French Indochina was mentioned by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° as a potential destination for Bah√° º√≠ teachers. After a sporadic visits from travelling teachers throughout the first half of the 20th century, the first Bah√° º√≠ group in Cambodia was established in Phnom Penh in 1956, with the arrival of Bah√° º√≠ teachers from India. During the rule of the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s, all effective contact with the Cambodian Bah√° º√≠s was lost. The efforts of Bah√° º√≠ teachers working in Cambodian refugee camps in Thailand led to the establishment of Local Spiritual Assemblies among the survivors of the Khmer Rouge's campaign of genocide.The Universal House of Justice. Century of Light. p.104. http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/bic/COL/col-11.html The Bah√° º√≠ community has recently seen a return to growth, especially in the city of Battambang; in 2009, the city was host to one of 41 Bah√° º√≠ regional conferences, and in 2012, the Universal House of Justice announced plans to establish a local Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship there. According to a 2010 estimate, Cambodia is home to approximately 10,000 Bah√° º√≠s. China The Bah√° º√≠ Faith was first introduced in China during the lifetime of its founder, Bah√° ºu'll√°h. The first record of a Bah√° º√≠ living in China is of a Persian, H√°j√≠ M√≠rz√° Muhammad- ºAl√≠, who lived in Shanghai from 1862 to 1868. In 1928 the first Local Spiritual Assembly in China was formed in Shanghai. As China expanded her efforts of reform and increased its interactions with the worldwide community more Bah√° º√≠s moved to China. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in China has still not matured to the same point as in many other countries of the world where there is an established structure to administer its affairs. As a result of the lack of formal registration and structure, it is difficult to ascertain with some degree of certainty, the number of Bah√° º√≠s in China. The number of active followers of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's Teachings in China has spread beyond the scope of knowledge of the existing administrative structures. Certainly there are active followers of the teachings of Bah√° ºu'll√°h in all of the major cities of China and in many regional centers and rural areas. Good working relationships have been developed with China's State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA.) There are many aspects of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's teachings that match well with traditional Chinese religious and philosophical beliefs such as : 1) the Great Unity (world peace); 2) unity of the human family; 3) service to others; 4) moral education; 5) extended family values; 6) the investigation of truth; 7) the Highest Reality (God); 8) the common foundation of religions; 9) harmony in Nature; 10) the purpose of tests and suffering; and 11) moderation in all things.Cheung, Albert. \\"Common Teachings from Chinese Culture and the Baha'i Faith: From Material Civilization to Spiritual Civilization\\" Published in Lights of Irfan, Book 1, pages 37‚Äì52 Wilmette, IL: Irfan Colloquia, Web Published (2000); http://bahai- library.com/?file=cheung_chinese_bahai_teachings.htm =Hong Kong= Hong Kong has a long history of Baha'i activity being the second location in China with Baha'is. Two brothers moved there in 1870 and established a long-running export business. Hong Kong did not have its first Local Spiritual Assembly until 1956 and then formed a National Spiritual Assembly in 1974. This was allowed because of Hong Kong's status at that time as similar to a sovereign nation and also due to the growth of the religion there. In 1997 sovereignty of Hong Kong was transferred to the People's Republic of China and it operates as a Special Administrative Area of China. The coordinating Spiritual Assembly there is no longer considered a \\"National\\" Spiritual Assembly but it still operates in a similar manner coordinating the activities of a very vibrant Baha'i community. In 2005 the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated the Bah√° º√≠ population of Hong Kong at about 1100. =Macau= The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Macao (also spelled Macau) was established much later than in other parts of China (1953) due, most likely, to the unique conditions of Macao being a Portuguese colony until 1999 and it being somewhat in the shadow of Hong Kong and larger centers in mainland China like Shanghai. Macao formed its first Local Spiritual Assembly in 1958 and then formed a National Spiritual Assembly in 1989. In 1999 sovereignty of Macao was transferred to the People's Republic of China and it operates as a Special Administrative Area of China. The coordinating Spiritual Assembly there is no longer considered a \\"National\\" Spiritual Assembly but it still operates in a similar manner coordinating the activities of a very vibrant Baha'i community which is estimated at 2,500 and which is considered one of the five major religions of Macao. =Taiwan= Â∑¥Âìà‰ºäÊïô, The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Taiwan began after the religion entered areas of China[94] and nearby Japan.[95] The first Bah√° º√≠s arrived in Taiwan in 1949[96] and the first of these to have become a Bah√° º√≠ was Mr. Jerome Chu (Chu Yao-lung) in 1945 while visiting the United States. By May 1955 there were eighteen Bah√° º√≠s in six localities across Taiwan. The first Local Spiritual Assembly in Taiwan was elected in Tainan in 1956. The National Spiritual Assembly was first elected in 1967 when there were local assemblies in Taipei, Tainan, Hualien, and Pingtung. Circa 2006 the Bah√° º√≠s showed up in the national census with 16,000 members and 13 assemblies.[97] India The Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in New Delhi. The largest Bah√° º√≠ community in the world is said to be in India, with an official Bah√° º√≠ population of more than 2 millionBaha'i Faith in India , FAQs, National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of India and roots that go back to the first days of the religion in 1844. A researcher, William Garlington, characterized the 1960s until present as a time of \\"Mass Teaching\\". He suggests that the mentality of the believers in India changed during the later years of Shoghi Effendi's ministry, when they were instructed to accept converts who were illiterate and uneducated. The change brought teaching efforts into the rural areas of India, where the teachings of the unity of humanity attracted many of the lower caste. The growth of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in India has been greatly assisted by the recognition of Krishna as a Messenger or Manifestation of God, alongside Jesus, Muhammad, and others. Bah√° º√≠s have thus been able to reach out to Hindus, as well as to some extent Muslims, Adivasis (or tribal people), and others. According to the 2005 Association of Religion Data Archives data there are close to some 1,880,000 Bah√° º√≠s. Indonesia The Bah√° º√≠ Faith's presence in Indonesia can be traced to the late 19th century, when two Bah√° º√≠s visited what is now Indonesia, as well as several other Southeast Asian countries. The Mentawai Islands were one of the first areas outside the Middle East and the Western world where significant numbers of conversions to the religion took place, beginning in 1957. In 2014, the Bah√° º√≠ International Community (BIC) established a regional office in Jakarta. Iran Estimates for the early 21st century vary between 150,000 and 500,000 adherents in Iran. During the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and the subsequent few years, a significant number of Bah√° º√≠s left the country during intensive persecution. Estimates before and after the revolution vary greatly. *Eliz Sanasarian writes in Religious Minorities in Iran (Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 53) that \\"Estimating the number of Bah√° º√≠s in Iran has always been difficult due to their persecution and strict adherence to secrecy. The reported number of Bah√° º√≠s in Iran has ranged anywhere from the outrageously high figure of 500,000 to the low number of 150,000. The number 300,000 has been mentioned most frequently, especially for the mid- to late- 1970s, but it is not reliable. Roger Cooper gives an estimate of between 150,000 and 300,000.\\" *The Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa (2004) states that \\"In Iran, by 1978, the Bah√° º√≠ community numbered around 300,000.\\" *The Columbia Encyclopedia (5th edition, 1993) reports that \\"Prior to the Iranian Revolution there were about 1 million Iranian Bah√° º√≠s.\\" *The Encyclopedia of Islam (new edition, 1960) reports that \\"In Persia, where different estimates of their number vary from more than a million down to about 500,000. [in 1958]\\" Israel View towards the Shrine of the B√°b from the upper Terraces on Mount Carmel, Haifa The administrative centre of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and the Shrine of the B√°b are located at the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre in Haifa, and the leader of the religion is buried in Acre. Apart from maintenance staff, there is no Bah√° º√≠ community in Israel, although it is a destination for pilgrimages. Bah√° º√≠ staff in Israel do not teach their faith to Israelis following strict Bah√° º√≠ policy. Japan Shinjuku Ward. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith was first introduced to Japan after mentions of the country by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° first in 1875. Japanese contact with the religion came from the West when was living in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1902 converted; the second being . In 1914 two Bah√° º√≠s, George Jacob Augur and Agnes Alexander, and their families, pioneered to Japan. Alexander would live some 31 years off and on in Japan until 1967 when she left for the last time The first Bah√° º√≠ convert on Japanese soil was in 1915.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° undertook several trips in 1911-1912 and met Japanese travelers in Western cities, in Paris, London, and New York.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° met Fujita in Chicago and Yamamoto in San Francisco.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° wrote a series of letters, or tablets, in 1916-1917 compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan but which was not presented in the United States until 1919. Fujita would serve between the World Wars first in the household of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and then of Shoghi Effendi. In 1932 the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in Tokyo and reelected in 1933. In all of Japan there were 19 Bah√° º√≠s. In 1937 Alexander went on Bah√° º√≠ pilgrimage to return years later. In 1938 Fujita was excused from his services in Haifa out of fears for his safety during World War II and returned to Japan until 1956. In 1942, back in the United States, the Yamamoto family lived at a relocation camp during the war. Bah√° º√≠ Americans associated with the American Occupation Forces reconnected the Japanese Bah√° º√≠ community  Michael Jamir found Fujita by 1946 and Robert Imagire helped re-elect the assembly in Tokyo in 1948. In 1963 the statistics of Bah√° º√≠ communities showed 13 assemblies and other smaller groups. In 1968 Japanese Bah√° º√≠s began to travel outside Japan. In 1971 the first residents of Okinawa converted to the religion. In 1991 the community organized an affiliate of the Association for Bah√° º√≠ Studies in Japan which has since held annual conferences, published newsletters, and published and coordinated academic work across affiliates.Yerrinbool Report on Scholarship 1999 Affiliate Associations for Bah√° º√≠ Studies-Japan The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 15650 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005 while the CIA World Factbook estimated about 12000 Japanese Bah√° º√≠s in 2006. Kazakhstan The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Kazakhstan began during the policy of oppression of religion in the former Soviet Union. Before that time, Kazakhstan, as part of the Russian Empire, would have had indirect contact with the Bah√° º√≠ Faith as far back as 1847. Following the entrance of pioneers the community grew to be the largest religious community after Islam and Christianity, though only a few percent of the nation. By 1994 the National Spiritual Assembly of Kazakhstan was electedThe Bah√° º√≠ Faith: 1844‚Äì1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bah√° º√≠ Teaching & Consolidation Plan 1953‚Äì1963, Compiled by Hands of the Cause Residing in the Holy Land, pages 22 and 46. and the community has begun to multiply its efforts across various interests. Laos A Baha'i gathering in Vientiane in 2009. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Laos begins after a brief mention by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in 1916 and the first Bah√° º√≠ enters Laos in about 1955. The first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly is known to be first elected by 1958 in Vientiane and eventually Laos' own National Spiritual Assembly in 1967. The current community is approximately eight thousand adherents and four centers: Vientiane, Vientiane Province, Kaysone Phomvihane, and in Pakxe. and smaller populations in other provinces. While well established and able to function as communities in these cities Bah√° º√≠s have a harder time in other provinces and cannot print their own religious materials. Malaysia A large concentration of Bah√° º√≠s is also found in Malaysia, made up of Chinese, Indians, Ibans, Kadazans, Aslis and other indigenous groups. The Bah√° º√≠ community of Malaysia claims that \\"about 1%\\" of the population are Bah√° º√≠s. Given the 2017 population of Malaysia, such a claim represents about 310,000 Bah√° º√≠s. =Sarawak= The Bah√° º√≠ Faith is one of the recognised religions in Sarawak, the largest state in Malaysia. Various races embraced the religion, from Chinese to Iban and Bidayuh, Bisayahs, Penans, Indians but not the Malays or other Muslims. In towns, the majority Bah√° º√≠ community is often Chinese, but in rural communities, they are of all races, Ibans, Bidayuhs, etc. In some schools, Bah√° º√≠ associations or clubs for students exist. Bah√° º√≠ communities are now found in all the various divisions of Sarawak. However, these communities do not accept assistance from government or other organisations for activities which are strictly for Bah√° º√≠s. If, however, these services extend to include non-Bah√° º√≠s also, e.g. education for children's classes or adult literacy, then sometimes the community does accept assistance. The administration of the religion is through local spiritual assemblies. There is no priesthood among the Bah√° º√≠s. Election is held annually without nomination or electioneering. The Bah√° º√≠s should study the community and seek those members who display mature experience, loyalty, and are knowledgeable in the religion's beliefs. There are more than 50,000 Bah√° º√≠s in more than 250 localities in Sarawak. Mongolia The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Mongolia dates back only to the 1980s and 1990s, as prior to that point Mongolia's Communist anti- religious stance impeded the spread of the religion to that country. The first Bah√° º√≠ arrived in Mongolia in 1988, and the religion established a foothold there, later establish a Local Spiritual Assembly in that nation. In 1994, the Bah√° º√≠s elected their first National Spiritual Assembly. Though the Association of Religion Data Archives estimated only some 50 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005 more than 1700 Mongolian Bah√° º√≠s turned out for a regional conference in 2009. In July 1989 Sean Hinton became the first Bah√° º√≠ to reside in Mongolia, was named a Knight of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, and the last name to be entered on the Roll of Honor at the Shrine of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Nepal The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Nepal begins after a Nepalese leader encountered the religion in his travels before World War II. Following World War II, the first known Bah√° º√≠ to enter Nepal was about 1952 and the first Nepalese Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly elected in 1961, and its National Spiritual Assembly in 1972. For a period of time, between 1976 and 1981, all assemblies were dissolved due to legal restrictions. The 2001 census reported 1211 Bah√° º√≠s, and since the 1990s the Bah√° º√≠ community of Nepal has been involved in a number of interfaith organizations including the Inter-religious Council of Nepal promoting peace in the country. North Korea Bah√° º√≠s originally entered the Korean Peninsula in 1921 before the Division of Korea. Both the 2005 the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on the World Christian Encyclopedia for adherents estimates) and independent research agree there are no Bah√° º√≠s in North Korea. Pakistan The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Pakistan begins previous to its independence when it was part of India. The roots of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in the region go back to the first days of the B√°b√≠ religion in 1844 especially with Shaykh Sa'id Hindi ‚Äì one of the Letters of the Living who was from Multan. During Bah√° ºu'll√°h's lifetime, as founder of the religion, he encouraged some of his followers to move to the area. Jamal Effendi visited Karachi in 1875 on one of his trips to parts of Southern Asia. Muhammad Raza Shirazi became a Bah√° º√≠ in Mumbai in 1908 and may have been the first Bah√° º√≠ to settle, pioneer, in Karachi. National coordinated activities across India began and reached a peak by the December 1920, first All-India Bah√° º√≠ Convention, held in Mumbai for three days. Representatives from India's major religious communities were present as well as Bah√° º√≠ delegates from throughout the country. In 1921, the Bah√° º√≠s of Karachi elected their first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly. In 1923, still as part of India, a regional National Spiritual Assembly was formed for all India and Burma which then included the area now part of Pakistan. From 1931 to 1933, Professor Pritam Singh, the first Bah√° º√≠ from a Sikh background, settled in Lahore and published an English language weekly called The Baha ºi Weekly and other initiatives. A Bah√° º√≠ publishing committee was established in Karachi in 1935. This body evolved and is registered as the Baha ºi Publishing Trust of Pakistan. In 1937, John Esslemont's Bah√° ºu'll√°h and the New Era was translated into Urdu and Gujrati in Karachi. The Committee also published scores of Bah√° º√≠ books and leaflets in many languages. The local assemblies spread across many cities and in 1957, East and West Pakistan elected a separate national assembly from India and in 1971, East Pakistan became Bangladesh with its own national assembly.Notes on Research on National Spiritual Assemblies Asia Pacific Bah√° º√≠ Studies. Waves of refugees came from the Soviet Union invasion of Afghanistan and the Islamic Revolutionin Iran and later from the Taliban. Some of these people were able to return home, some stayed, and others moved on. In Pakistan the Bah√° º√≠s have had the right to hold public meetings, establish academic centers, teach their faith, and elect their administrative councils. However, the government prohibits Bah√° º√≠s from traveling to Israel to have Bah√° º√≠ pilgrimage. Nevertheless, Bah√° º√≠s in Pakistan set up a school and most of the students were not Bah√° º√≠s. as well as other projects addressing the needs of Pakistan. And the religion continues to grow and in 2004 the Bah√° º√≠s of Lahore began seeking for a new Bah√° º√≠ cemetery. The World Christian Encyclopedia estimated over 78,000 Bah√° º√≠s lived in Pakistan in 2000 though Bah√° º√≠s claimed less than half that number. The Philippines The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in the Philippines started in 1921 with the first Bah√° º√≠ first visiting the Philippines that year, and by 1944 a Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly was established. In the early 1960s, during a period of accelerated growth, the community grew from 200 in 1960 to 1,000 by 1962 and 2000 by 1963. In 1964 the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of the Philippines was elected and by 1980 there were 64,000 Bah√° º√≠s and 45 local assemblies. The Bah√° º√≠s have been active in multi/inter-faith developments. No recent numbers are available on the size of the community. Russia The Bah√° º√≠ Faith (–í–µ—Ä–∞ –ë–∞—Ö–∞–∏) in Russia begins with connections during the Russian rule in Azerbaijan in the Russian Empire in the form of the figure of a woman who would play a central role in the religion of the B√°b, viewed by Bah√°¬¥√≠s as the direct predecessor of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith - she would be later named Tahirih. Soon after, Russian diplomats to Persia\\"Notes on the B√°b√≠ and Bah√° º√≠ Religions in Russia and its Territories\\" , by Graham Hassall, Journal of Bah√° º√≠ Studies, 5.3 (September‚ÄìDecember 1993) would observe, react to, and sends updates about, the B√°b√≠ religion which was succeeded by their encounters with Bah√° ºu'll√°h, the founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. While the religion spread across the Russian Empire and attracted the attention of scholars and artists, the Bah√° º√≠ community in Ashgabat built the first Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship, elected one of the first Bah√° º√≠ local administrative institutions and was a center of scholarship. During the period of the Soviet Union Russia adopted the Soviet policy of oppression of religion, so the Bah√° º√≠s, strictly adhering to their principle of obedience to legal government, abandoned its administration and properties but in addition Bah√° º√≠s across the Soviet Union were sent to prisons and camps or abroad. Before the Dissolution of the Soviet Union Bah√° º√≠s in several cities were able to gather and organize as Perestroyka approached from Moscow through many Soviet republics. The National Assembly of the Russian Federations was ultimately formed in 1995. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated the Bah√° º√≠s in Russia at about 18,990 in 2005. South Korea Approximately 200 active Bah√° º√≠s reside in South Korea. Singapore A variety of materials have been published by Bah√° º√≠s in Singapore. See also Religion in Singapore. Taiwan Â∑¥Âìà‰ºäÊïô, The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Taiwan began after the religion entered areas of China and nearby Japan. The first Bah√° º√≠s arrived in Taiwan in 1949 and the first of these to have become a Bah√° º√≠ was Mr. Jerome Chu (Chu Yao- lung) in 1945 while visiting the United States. By May 1955 there were eighteen Bah√° º√≠s in six localities across Taiwan. The first Local Spiritual Assembly in Taiwan was elected in Tainan in 1956. The National Spiritual Assembly was first elected in 1967 when there were local assemblies in Taipei, Tainan, Hualien, and Pingtung. Circa 2006 the Bah√° º√≠s showed up in the national census with 16,000 members and 13 assemblies.  Turkmenistan  The first Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship was built in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Turkmenistan begins before Russian advances into the region when the area was under the influence of Persia. By 1887 a community of Bah√° º√≠ refugees from religious violence in Persia had made a religious center in Ashgabat. Shortly afterwards ‚Äì by 1894 ‚Äì Russia made Turkmenistan part of the Russian Empire. While the Bah√° º√≠ Faith spread across the Russian Empire and attracted the attention of scholars and artists, the Bah√° º√≠ community in Ashgabat built the first Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship, elected one of the first Bah√° º√≠ local administrative institutions and was a center of scholarship. However, during the Soviet period religious persecution made the Bah√° º√≠ community almost disappear ‚Äì however Bah√° º√≠s who moved into the regions in the 1950s did identify individuals still adhering to the religion. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late 1991, Bah√° º√≠ communities and their administrative bodies started to develop across the nations of the former Soviet Union; In 1994 Turkmenistan elected its own National Spiritual Assembly however laws passed in 1995 in Turkmenistan required 500 adult religious adherents in each locality for registration and no Bah√° º√≠ community in Turkmenistan could meet this requirement. As of 2007 the religion had still failed to reach the minimum number of adherents to register and individuals have had their homes raided for Bah√° º√≠ literature. United Arab Emirates The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in the United Arab Emirates begins before the specific country gained independence in 1971. The first Bah√° º√≠s arrived in Dubai by 1950,The Bah√° º√≠ Faith: 1844‚Äì1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bah√° º√≠ Teaching & Consolidation Plan 1953‚Äì1963, Compiled by Hands of the Cause Residing in the Holy Land, pages 4, 25, 28, 118. and by 1957, there were four Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assemblies in the region of the UAE and a regional National Spiritual Assembly of the Arabian Peninsula. Recent estimates count some 75,000 Bah√° º√≠s or 1.6% of the national population ‚Äì second only to Iran in number of Bah√° º√≠s in the nations of the Middle East. Uzbekistan The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Uzbekistan began in the lifetime of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, the founder of the religion. Circa 1918 there was an estimated 1900 Bah√° º√≠s in Tashkent. By the period of the policy of oppression of religion in the former Soviet Union the communities shrank away ‚Äì by 1963 in the entire USSR there were about 200 Bah√° º√≠s. Little is known until the 1980s when the Bah√° º√≠ Faith started to grow across the Soviet Union again. In 1991 a Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly of the Soviet Union was elected but was quickly split among its former members. In 1992, a regional National Spiritual Assembly for the whole of Central Asia was formed with its seat in Ashgabat. In 1994 the National Spiritual Assembly of Uzbekistan was elected. In 2008 eight Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assemblies or smaller groups had registered with the government though more recently there were also raids and expulsions.  Vietnam  Vietnamese Baha'is elect their National Spiritual Assembly in Danang, in 2009. The introduction of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Vietnam first occurred in the 1920s, not long after French Indochina was mentioned by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° as a potential destination for Bah√° º√≠ teachers. After a number of brief visits from travelling teachers throughout the first half of the 20th century, the first Bah√° º√≠ group in Vietnam was established in Saigon in 1954, with the arrival of Shirin Fozdar, a Bah√° º√≠ teacher from India. The 1950s and 1960s were marked by periods of rapid growth, mainly in South Vietnam; despite the ongoing war affecting the country, the Bah√° º√≠ population surged to around 200,000 adherents by 1975. After the end of the war, Vietnam was reunified under a communist government, who proscribed the practice of the religion from 1975 to 1992, leading to a sharp drop in community numbers. Relations with the government gradually improved, however, and in 2007 the Bah√° º√≠ Faith was officially registered, followed by its full legal recognition a year later. As of 2011, it was reported that the Bah√° º√≠ community comprised about 8,000 followers.

By itself, the SMCA measures 3.45 square miles. The SMCA protects marine life by limiting the removal of marine wildlife from within its borders, including tide pools. Dana Point SMCA prohibits take of living marine resources except: only the following species may be taken recreationally below the mean lower low tide line only: finfish by hook-and-line or by spearfishing, and lobster and sea urchin. The commercial take of coastal pelagic species by round haul net, and spiny lobster and sea urchin only is allowed. Spiny lobster Sea Urchin Dana Point's 7.5 miles of coastline consists of a myriad of marine habitats. Animals and plants suited to sandy beaches, rocky intertidal and kelp forest ecosystems abound here. Take pursuant to operation and maintenance of artificial structures inside the conservation area is allowed per any required federal, state and local permits, or as otherwise authorized by the department. Take of all living marine resources from inside tidepools is prohibited. For purposes of this section, tidepools are defined as the area encompassing the rocky pools that are filled with seawater due to retracting tides between the mean higher high tide line and the mean lower low tide line. Please see the following for official details on boundaries, regulations and other information: California Department of Fish and Game. \\"\\". History Dana Point SMCA is one of 36 new marine protected areas adopted by the California Fish and Game Commission in December, 2010 during the third phase of the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative. The MLPAI is a collaborative public process to create a statewide network of protected areas along California‚Äôs coastline. This initiative modified, updated and reorganized the MPAs along the shoreline of southern Orange County. The south coast‚Äôs new marine protected areas were designed by local divers, fishermen, conservationists and scientists who comprised the South Coast Regional Stakeholder Group. Their job was to design a network of protected areas that would preserve sensitive sea life and habitats while enhancing recreation, study and education opportunities. The south coast marine protected areas went into effect in 2012. Geography and natural features Dana Point SMCA is a marine protected area that includes the nearshore area off the area between Laguna Beach and Dana Point in Orange County on California‚Äôs south coast. Boundary: This area is bounded by the mean high tide line and straight lines connecting the following points in the order listed: # # # # # and # . Habitat and wildlife Dana Point SMCA protects kelp forest/surf grass and rocky reef habitat and associated species. It provides protection of intertidal invertebrate species such as Kellet's whelks, top shells, limpets and sea cucumbers and abalone while allowing lobster and urchin and finfish take. Recreation and nearby attractions Spanning the scenic shoreline of south Orange County from south of Newport Beach to the Dana Point Harbor, the south Orange County MPA complexes sit amongst some of southern California‚Äôs most visited coastal recreation amenities. Miles of sandy beaches, coves and points, and blufftop hiking trails are available for beachcombing, wading, surfing, snorkeling and kayaking. To the north, Crystal Cove State Beach abuts the Crystal Cove State Marine Conservation Area, providing access trails, interpretative signage and kiosks, along with restrooms and visitor facilities. Popular scuba diving and snorkeling spots also dot the State Park‚Äôs coastline. Laguna Beach SMR sits among numerous sandy coves with dramatic rock formations and fascinating tidepools, along with famous surfing spots such as Aliso Beach, Doheney, and Salt Creek. Throughout this area, collecting living marine resources from the intertidal area is prohibited to preserve wildlife, while some fishing opportunities are available offshore along the Crystal Cove and Dana Point coastline outside the Laguna Beach SMR and SMCA. Inland, both Crystal Cove State Park and Aliso Canyon Regional Park offer hiking and picnicking opportunities within their protected borders. Visitor services including fine dining and refreshments, lodging, museums and other visitor attractions abound within this urban and tourist-friendly area. The City of Laguna beach is a top southern California tourist attraction, hosting art galleries and beachside restaurants. Scientific monitoring As specified by the Marine Life Protection Act, select marine protected areas along California‚Äôs south coast are being monitored by scientists to track their effectiveness and learn more about ocean health. Similar studies in marine protected areas located off of the Santa Barbara Channel Islands have already detected gradual improvements in fish size and number.
