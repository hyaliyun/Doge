She lives and works in Porto Alegre (Brazil) and Berlin (Germany). Early life and education Born in Macei√≥ (Alagoas, northeast Brazil), Camargo moved to Porto Alegre at the age of nine. She began university there, before completing her arts education in Barcelona, New York, and Munich. She studied for a Bachelors and a master's degree in Visual Arts at Instituto de Artes / UFRGS (in Porto Alegre) and holds a Diploma from Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, where she studied with Peter Kogler. Work Marina Camargo has both her graduation and master in visual arts and works with photography, drawing, video and other media. The core subject of her production is the representation of the world apart from its origin. She took part in solo and collective exhibitions in Brazil and other countries, and received awards and scholarships to study abroad. In 2010, Camargo was awarded a one-year German Academic Exchange Service - DAAD scholarship to Munich. She devoted attention to the landscape and cultural history of Germany, making works where the social memory and representation of the alpine landscape are the main focus of research, such as Oblivion, based on a series of found postcards featuring the Alpine mountains, and Alpenprojekt. Other projects have concerned archival moving image, as the work Eva Braun's Mountains, a stop motion video based on historical footages taken by Eva Braun at Hitler's country house known as Eagle's Nest. > ‚ÄúMarina Camargo‚Äôs Alpenprojekt is a series of videos registering the action > of cutting out silhouettes of the Alps ‚Äì at once an attempt at capturing and > a reaction to this landscape, which wavers between the sublime and the > artificial.

She agitated for the Creole language spoken in Cura√ßao, Papiamento, to become an official language and was successful in the struggle, having created both language schools and texts to further its cultural significance. She was in favor of full independence of Cura√ßao from the Netherlands. Early life Joceline Andrea Clemencia was born on 30 November 1952 in Cura√ßao. She completed her higher education in Amsterdam, earning a doctorate degree in Spanish and Spanish literature from the University of Amsterdam. During her student days, she became involved in several activist movements including worldwide protests against the Vietnam War and the independence movements of the Netherlands Antilles. Career In the early 1980s, Clemencia returned to Cura√ßao and began working as a Spanish teacher at the Peter Stuyvesant College, now the Kolegio Alejandro Paula, in Willemstad, Cura√ßao. A large part of her activism centered on the Papiamento language and its suppression. By the early 1990s, she was serving as director of the Instituto di Nashonal Sede di Papiamentu (National Institute of the Papiamento Language) to promote usage and teaching of the native language of Aruba, Bonaire and Cura√ßao. Because Papiamento has roots in the slave trade, there was little public support in preserving the language or teaching it in the Dutch school system. She advocated for the language to be standardized and taught, as it was the mother-tongue of the country. In a report prepared for UNESCO, Clemencia argued that Papiamentu and English should be declared the national languages of the Antilles. Clemencia also served as a supervisor in the Government Bureau of Linguistics. She founded and became the director of the Instituto Kultural Independensha (Institute of Cultural Independence) in 1996 with the goal of teaching Papiamento. She also founded the Skol Nobo (New School) to teach cultural history, including, art, sport, and nature studies which were not included in other school curricula. Clemencia co-wrote with Omayra Leeflang a text for teaching Papiamento entitled Papiamentu Funshonal, which became a standard for secondary education instruction. Her efforts at recognition of Papiamentu as an official language were finally successful in 2007, when the government accepted it as one of the official languages, along with Dutch and English. Through her study of language, Clemencia wrote about women and their relationships to language and communication. The terms and customs that women used among themselves to give messages about themselves were one of the themes she often wrote about. As a member of the Caribbean Association of Women and Scholars (ACWWS), Clemencia participated in conferences and meetings to promote a feminist identity which recognized the diversity of women from the Caribbean and allow their contributions to be told in their own voice, be that Dutch, English, French, Spanish or Creole languages, as the language used defines an identity strategy for the writer. Though an ardent feminist, Clemencia believed that general emancipation, including identity, independence and language, were critical elements in attaining political freedom. During the early years of the 21st century, facing high unemployment and social unrest in Cura√ßao, Clemencia joined with other intellectuals and in 2006 formed the Grupo Pro Defensa di K√≤rsou (Group in Favor of the Defense of Cura√ßao) and a political party called Partido Indepensha (Independence Party). She was the party chair and campaigned vigorously for independence from The Netherlands. Though she combined her party's influence with 's Party Workers' Liberation Front 30 May, they were defeated and the final results of the referendum was not full independence. Cura√ßao became an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, dependent on the kingdom for defense and foreign policy decisions. Shortly after the results, Clemencia withdrew from politics because of her private battle with breast cancer. Personal Clemencia was married to Frank Kirindongo (also known as Frank Quirindongo), with whom she had three children before their divorce. She died on 30 May 2011 in Willemstad after a two-year battle with breast cancer.

The station is served by the California Zephyr. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q;) constructed the station in 1899, and is listed is on the National Register of Historic Places as the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad-Creston Station. Amtrak moved back into the historic station in 2019, after previously serving Creston via a small 1969-built station just east of the current location. It is also used by the city of Creston as a city hall and community center, known as the Creston Municipal Complex. History The station was built by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q;) in 1899 for $75,000. The Chicago architectural firm of Burnham and Root, who designed many of the CB&Q;'s stations, designed this station as well. Creston was a division headquarters, therefore all of the railroad's business in southwest Iowa operated from here. It also housed the office of the Master Carpenter, who oversaw all section and bridge work for the division, and the office of the trainmaster, who oversaw the switching and forming of trains in the Creston yards. In addition to the CB&Q; mainline, two branch lines originated from here, and another railroad operated from the depot as well. Creston also had various maintenance shops and contained a roundhouse; both have since been demolished or destroyed by a tornado. Passenger rail service in the United States heavily declined in the 1960s, and the large Creston station was deemed too expensive to maintain. In 1969, the CB&Q; built a small brick and steel depot to the east of the original station. This was later used by Amtrak after its creation in 1971. The original station was sold to the city of Creston for $1. The future of the station was seen in limbo, and the mayor of Creston noted in 1970 that the area would be a good site for a parking lot. Local residents launched a \\"Save the Depot Committee\\" and gathered 700 letters of support for saving the depot. The building was also listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Renovations were completed in December 1978, and the building houses various community rooms on the first floor and city government on the second floor. Amtrak service was restored to the historic station on August 1, 2019. Amtrak signed a 20-year lease with the city of Creston in 2017. Work was performed by Amtrak to make the waiting room ADA-accessible. The nearby platforms of the 1969-station are still in use to board trains.

Controversies =Gangaiah Murder= Ramesh had allegedly snatched a gun from his security guard Krishnappa and shot dead Gangaiah during clashes with Janata Dal supporters outside an inspection bungalow in Kunigal, Tumkur district. This happened during the assembly by-elections in the constituency in June 1992. Following the incident, an investigation was ordered by then Chief Minister Bangarappa, which gave a clean chit to Ramesh in its 'B' summary report to the Kunigal magistrate's court. Veerappa Moily, who took over as the chief minister in 1993 appointed retired judge M.S. Patil to inquire into the incident. In June 1995, Patil submitted his findings to the Government. In late February 1996, the Government tabled the report in legislature since such reports should be within eight months of submission. The report accused the police for clearing the minister of the murder charges and reiterated that Gangaiah had sustained the bullet injury as a result of the firing by Ramesh, which lead to his death. The report accused investigating officer G.K. Bekal \\"A cursory reading of the 'B' summary report would show that he (Bekal) played the role of a judge and virtually wrote a judgment of acquittal.\\" Following the tabling of the report, Home Minister P.G.R. Sindhia announced that the Government would withdraw the 'B' report and launch criminal proceedings against Ramesh and Krishnappa based on the Patil committee findings. Both the two accused had sought anticipatory bail. Death He died of heart attack on 7-July-2006. He was survived by his wife, a son and a daughter. Then Chief Minister H. D.

It is a shrub which branches from ground level and which has lance-shaped leaves and orange-red flowers. It occurs in South Australia and the Northern Territory. Description Eremophila neglecta is a shrub with its branches sticky and shiny due to the presence of resin and which grows to a height of between . Many of the branches arise from ground level and are rough due to the presence of raised leaf bases. The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and are mostly long, wide, narrow lance-shaped and which taper to a leaf stalk long. Young leaves are densely hairy but become glabrous, sticky and shiny as they age. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on an S-shaped, sticky stalk, mostly long. There are 5 overlapping, egg-shaped sepals which are mostly long, glabrous on the outer surface and hairy along the edges and on the inner surface. The sepals are coloured orange to purplish-red, or yellow with a pinkish tinge. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is orange-red with red petal lobes and the inside of the tube is yellow with fine orange spots. Occasionally the petal tube is pure yellow. The outside of the petal tube and both sides of the lobes are covered with glandular hairs and the inside of the tube is filled with long, soft hairs. The 4 stamens extend beyond the end of the petal tube. Flowering occurs mainly from July to September and is followed by fruits which are woody, oval to cone-shaped with a swollen base and a pointed end and are long. E. neglecta habit Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1914 by John McConnell Black and the description was published in Transansactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia. The specific epithet (neglecta) is a Latin word meaning \\"disregarded\\" or \\"overlooked\\". Distribution and habitat Eremophila neglecta occurs in the northern part of South Australia and the southern part of the Northern Territory where it grows in stony clay on rocky hills and plains, usually in mulga woodland. Conservation This species is classified as \\"of least concern\\" in the Northern Territory. Uses =Indigenous use= The leaves of this species were used by Aboriginal people in an infusion to promote well-being. =Essential oils= Eremophila neglecta leaves contain serrulatanes which have antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium species and the naphthoquinone biflorin. =Horticulture= The bright red flowers of this eremophila are especially attractive as well as providing food for nectar- feeding birds.

In 1615 the poet Sir William Mure of Rowallan Castle married Anna Dundas, the daughter of the laird of Newliston, an estate located near Edinburgh. William was the son of Elizabeth Montgomerie, sister of the well known poet Alexander Montgomerie of Hessilhead Castle near Beith. In 1643 William Mure was a member of the Scottish parliament through which the Solemn League and Covenant was ratified with England and took part in the English campaign of 1644. He fought and was wounded at the Battle of Marston Moor, shortly after commanding a regiment at Newcastle. As a first home or dower house he built Dalmusternock in 1615 for although he was the eldest son he had not as yet inherited the family properties and would not do so until 1639. Dalmusternock is in an attractive location on the Fenwick Water within easy reach of the family seat at Rowallan Castle. The coat of arms of Sir William and his wife are still located above the entrance door. The 1615 date of his marriage is carved on a stone to the right of the doorway with the initials A. D. for his wife Anna Dundas on a stone to the left.The Works of Sir William Mure of Rowallan Five sons and six daughters came of this first marriage, namely William who succeeded, Captain Allexander who was killed fighting rebels in Ireland, Major Robert who married Lady Newhall in Fife, John of Fenwickhill and Patrick, who in 1662 was created a baronet of Nova Scotia. Only one daughter, Elizabeth, reached maturity and married Uchter Knox, Laird of Ranfurly. His first wife Anna died comparatively young and Sir William then married Dame Jane Hamilton, Lady Duntreth, having two sons, James and Hugh and two daughters, Jeane and Marion from this union.The Works of Sir William Mure of Rowallan.

The program, distributed by isee systems (formerly High Performance Systems) allows users to run models created as graphical representations of a system using four fundamental building blocks. STELLA has been used in academia as a teaching tool and has been utilized in a variety of research and business applications. The program has received positive reviews, being praised in particular for its ease of use and low cost. History While working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1960s, Jay Wright Forrester developed the earliest understanding of system dynamics which he argued could only be understood using models. Dartmouth College systems science professor Barry Richmond founded High Performance Systems in 1984. With financial support of Analog Devices, Inc. and technical support from Apple Computer, he developed STELLA (short for Structural Thinking, Experimental Learning Laboratory with Animation) at his company. He presented the prototype for the visual programming language in 1985 at the System Dynamics Society's annual conference in a paper entitled \\"STELLA: Software for Bringing System Dynamics to the Other 98%\\". Within that paper, Richmond mused on the study of system dynamics: \\"If this stuff really is so great, then why hasn't the field 'taken off'?\\" Steve Peterson, a colleague of Richmond's, reflected after his death in 2002 that Richmond held the belief that modeling was a tool everyone should be using and that that notion was reflected in Richmond's work. He quoted a 1994 paper in which Richmond described STELLA as \\"quite unique, quite powerful, and quite broadly useful as a way of thinking and or learning. It's also capable of being quite transparent‚Äìleveraging the way we learn biology, manage our businesses, or run our personal lives\\". Functionality and features alt=A diagram with a blue rectangle (\\"Cat population\\") being fed by blue arrows (\\"Cat births\\" and \\"Cat deaths\\"). Pink arrows feed the blue arrows from \\"Cat birth rate\\" and \\"Cat death rate\\" circles. STELLA's approach to modeling systems shares some similarities with a precursor, the DYNAMO simulation language. DYNAMO explicitly defined \\"stocks\\" (reservoirs) and \\"flows\\" (inputs and outputs) as key variables in a system, a vocabulary which STELLA shares. Within STELLA, users are presented with a graphical user interface in which they may create graphical models of a system using four fundamentals: stocks, flows, converters, and connectors. Relationships between converters (which convey transforming variables) and other elements may be drawn with converters. Users are able to input values for stocks, flows, and converters (including with a variety of builtin functions). STELLA does not differentiate between external and intermediate variables within a system; all of them are represented with converters. The software produces finite difference equations that describe the graphical model and allows users to select a numerical analysis method to apply to the system, either the Euler method or various Runge‚ÄìKutta methods (either second or fourth order). Before running a model, users may also specify a time step and runtime for the simulation. STELLA can output data in graphical or tabular forms. STELLA runs one window at a time meaning that only one model can be run at any given moment. The program's native file formats are denoted either by an \`.stm\`, \`.stmx\`, \`.itm\`, or \`.itmx\` filename extension. STELLA also uses the emerging XML-based standard for storing models, XMILE . The language runs of Microsoft Windows and OS X and its most recent release was version 10.1.2. In 2012, two researchers released StellaR, software which can translate STELLA models into the R programming language. Applications =Education= A STELLA model from a paper on carbon impacts in forest biomass Because of its simplicity relative to more complex modeling languages, STELLA has been cited as a useful tool in educational settings. Richmond derisively viewed most education as \\"assimilating content\\" and proposed systems thinking as a remedy to this. In 1987, High Performance Systems released a guide to STELLA encouraging its use in academic settings and numerous textbooks have been published that teach modeling and systems thinking using the software. Sample exercises with STELLA include recreating the Daisyworld model, simulating the Easter Island population crash, and modeling the protagonist's motivation throughout William Shakespeare's Hamlet. A 2010 study of the efficacy of project-based learning upon a watershed-modeling project undertaken by 72 middle schoolers found that the addition of a STELLA modeling component in the project improved overall comprehension of the material over traditional methods, especially among female students who outperformed their male counterparts with the addition of STELLA. =Academia and commerce= The software is also used in research settings. Among other projects, researchers have used STELLA to apply Hubbert peak theory to the Chinese coal supply, to model atrazine dynamics within agricultural lands, and to simulate the interactions between marine macroinvertebrates. isee systems markets an identical software targeted at business consumers under the name iThink (previously STELLA for Business). iThink models have been applied to a variety of systems including manufacturing lines, hospital waste in developing nations, and competition in the home video market. Reception In a 1987 review of the program in BioScience, Robert Costanza wrote that \\"STELLA is a solid program‚Äìwell planned and executed‚Äìthat breaks new ground.\\" He praised its ease of use as beneficial both to beginners interested in learning how to build models and experts who could use it to test components of more complex models. A 1998 review of the program in the Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America concurred that the program was easy to use, especially for beginning modelers, but noted its lack of model optimization tools and the ability to run only one window at a time as drawbacks. Writing for Complexity in 1997, Benedikt Hallgr√≠msson found the program's accompanying manual to be overzealous in its promotion of systems theory but cautioned that \\"the manual need not detract from what is otherwise a very well-thought-out and constructed program.\\" A 1991 review of iThink in Planning Review noted that the software's strength was in its low cost (the program retailed at around $450 at the time) and the vast number of possibilities allowed by its open-ended form.

Pomeroy, and features Cromwell standing and pointing. The statue is approached by three steps of Aberdeen granite, with ornamental lamps on each corner. The location of the statue in the market place in St Ives had been proposed by the historian Thomas Carlyle in an 1849 letter. Carlyle wrote to I.K. Holland that: In 1899 the nearby town of Huntingdon abandoned their plan to erect a statue to Cromwell, and the opportunity was seized by St Ives. F. W. Pomeroy was commissioned as the sculptor, and the statue was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in London to good reviews. It is the only statue of Cromwell in England that was funded by public donations. The statue has been described as the \\"...second most visited and photographed monument\\" in St Ives after the town's bridge chapel on the St Ives Bridge dedicated to St Ledger.

Although he had never driven a car or seen a traffic jam, as a traffic reporter he used what he heard about traffic on police scanners and in calls with listeners on the road. Motivated to review films by his frustration with their visual language, he started a YouTube channel called Blind Film Critic with his friend Ben Churchill in 2011. His reviews focus on script, music and sound effects. The first film he reviewed was Scream 4; his favorites include Hugo, Goodfellas, Clerks and American Hustle.

Heck (June 9, 1869October 18, 1938) was an American politician and jurist from Wisconsin, who served as a County Judge and Progressive Republican Wisconsin State Senator. Biography Max Heck was born in Chicago, Illinois, one of seven children born to Jacob and Victoria (Schlund) Heck. His parents were both German American immigrants, but were well established in the United States by the time of his birth. When Max was six months old, his family moved back to Racine, Wisconsinwhere they had previously resided before his birth. He was raised and educated there, attending public schools. After his primary education, he attended Howlands Academy and studied law in the office of Hand & Flett while working as a paperboy and then letter carrier. Finally he attended the University of Wisconsin Law School, graduated in 1892, and was admitted to the State Bar of Wisconsin in June of that year. He practiced law in Racine, and became involved with the Democratic Party. In 1893, under the presidency of Grover Cleveland, Heck was appointed stamp collector of internal revenue for Racine, an office he retained until resigning in July of 1897 at the arrival of his successor. In 1894 he sought the Democratic nomination for district attorney, making a strong showing in the first round of balloting, but ultimately did not get the nomination. Nevertheless, he remained active and influential in the party and became chairman of the party in the city of Racine. As he rose in local political prominence, he also rose in prominence in his legal career, forming a law partnership known as Richie & Heck. In 1894, he earned local notoriety when he successfully won the acquittal of Mary Mayer, who had been charged with poisoning her husband, Herman Groenke. =War and City Attorney= At the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, in 1898, he enlisted in the United States Army and was enrolled as a private in Company F, 1st Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He left the state with the regiment in late April, but a week after his departure, the Racine City Council voted to name him City Attorney. Heck's volunteer regiment was billeted to Camp Cuba Libre near Jacksonville, Florida. They did not see any combat in the short war, but lost 40 men to disease. That fall, Heck received a thirty day furlough to return to Racine and accompany the body of fellow Racinian Charles Evenson, who had died of Typhoid Fever. During that trip, he formally took office as City Attorney on August 23, 1898, and the City Council passed a resolution requesting an honorable discharge for him so that he could continue to attend to his responsibilities in the city. The request was transmitted to the Governor, who was commander-in-chief of the state volunteer force, and Congressman Henry Allen Cooper, receiving a prompt favorable reply. =Elected office= In 1901, he ran for County Judge in the seat being vacated by Judge Ellsworth Burnett Belden, who was opting to run for the Wisconsin Circuit Court seat instead. He won the April election and was inaugurated in January 1902. He went on to win re-election in 1907. In 1913, Judge Heck suffered a form of mental breakdown and was admitted to the Pennoyer Sanitarium to recuperate. He did not run for re-election and left office at the end of his term, in January 1914. During his time as County Judge, Heck transitioned from the Democratic Party to become a member of the Progressive faction of the Republican Party, whichin Wisconsinwas closely identified with then- Governor Robert M. La Follette. In 1922, Judge Heck was elected to represent Racine County in the Wisconsin State Senate, running as a La Follette Republican, and he was a strong support of La Follette's campaign for the presidency in the 1924 election. Heck was not a candidate for re-election in 1926. In the 1925-1926 session of the Wisconsin Legislature, Senator Heck became the first chairman of the Joint Committee on Taxation. =Later years= Heck remained active in politics after leaving office, joining the Progressive Party when it officially split from the Republican Party and serving as a state party officer for over a decade. On the day of his death, he was scheduled to preside at a local meeting with U.S. Senator Robert M. La Follette Jr. La Follette still attended the event and paid tribute to the Judge at the event. He died on October 18, 1938, he fell from his roof while attempting to trim the trees around his home. Personal life and family Max Heck married Luella Margaret Pritchard on April 29, 1896. They had one daughter, Margery, who attended Marquette University and became a successful lawyer and worked for a time as deputy clerk of the Wisconsin Circuit Court in Racine County.

After the formation of the command, it was first necessary to take under U.S. control the German warships assigned to the U.S. as war prizes (for example, the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen). To this end, in Bremerhaven, a Naval Service Unit (MDG) was established. After the initial, purely administrative order, the settlement of the German Kriegsmarine and the merchant navy was in cooperation with the other allies, finished, the command was greatly reduced. It was intended to completely dissolve the command in 1948. However, the American military governor General Lucius D.

The book was re-published in April 2017 with a new preface by Kimmel discussing U.S. President Donald Trump. Overview Kimmel examines what he describes as the aggrieved entitlement of white men in early 21st-century American society. According to Kimmel, many white men, as members of a historically dominant group in America, have reacted to increases in social equality and the loss of economic advantage with overt anger and rage. Written from a scholarly perspective, the book describes various manifestations of this anger, including domestic violence, shootings, involvement in white supremacist groups, and the men's rights and fathers' rights movements. Each chapter of the book discusses a different topic and population of men, including young men and violence, men's rights groups, men's violence toward women, the white working class, and white supremacist groups such as Neo-Nazis. Reception Describing the book as a \\"missed opportunity\\", the Financial Times's Gary Silverman writes: Sarah Sobieraj from Tufts University writes that the book will \\"inspire robust debate in many undergraduate classrooms\\" but that it \\"will not, however, be popular with angry white men,\\" noting that it is a \\"shame\\" that the men who are represented within the book are likely the men that will not want to read it. Zak Foste from Ohio State University \\"honors\\" Kimmel for his work interviewing so many men with whom he disagreed on a fundamental level in order to write this book.

Although DCL1 is named for its homology with the metazoan protein Dicer, its role in miRNA biogenesis is somewhat different, due to substantial differences in miRNA maturation processes between plants and animals. Unlike Dicer, DCL1 is localized to the cell nucleus, where it initiates miRNA processing as the catalytic component of the so-called Dicing complex, which also contains HYL1, a double-stranded RNA binding protein, and a zinc-finger protein known as SE or SERRATE. Within the nucleus, Dicing complexes co- localize in Dicing bodies or D-bodies. In plants, DCL1 is responsible both for processing a primary miRNA to a pre-miRNA, and for then processing the pre- miRNA to a mature miRNA. In animals, the equivalents of these two steps are carried out by different proteins; pri-miRNA processing takes place in the nucleus by the ribonuclease Drosha as part of the Microprocessor complex, and processing to a mature miRNA takes place in the cytoplasm by Dicer to yield a mature miRNA. Although DCL1 is responsible for the majority of the miRNA processing in plants, most plants contain an additional three members of the same family (DCL2, DCL3, DCL4) with related roles in RNA processing.

Some of the main advantages to rapid tooling trades is that it decreases the time and cost of the product. With rapid tools being fast and easily reproducible, it requires less stock for finished tools. These tools will be produced on demand and are available almost immediately. Special tools or tools where no supplier is existing on the market any more can be reproduced without bigger design and production efforts. However, the disadvantages are that it is not as accurate and also shortens the lifespan of the product. Rapid tooling is mainly used for specific needs including prototyping and troubleshooting existing problems. Rapid prototyping is not often used for large scale and long term operations for a part. Nevertheless, rapid tooling is starting to be used to create molds for commercial operations because the time lag is so short between start to finish and since a CAD file is the only thing needed for the design stage. Since alternate methods require precious time and resources, rapid tooling provides a way to quickly provide molds for the required products. This allows companies to quickly make commercial products with the advances of rapid prototyping. In addition, rapid tooling provides the customization necessary for personal applications. Instead of tedious trial and error measurements, rapid prototyping processes allow scientists and doctors the ability to scan and digitize the item or patient. Then by putting it through a CAD program, a personal custom mold can be created to fix the problem. An example of this procedure is for dental patients. Originally to fabricate an oral application, an alginate impression or a wax registration is used to fit the teeth with the mold. With new advances, doctors can take a scan of the dental arches to correctly and quickly make a mold out of silicone for the patient. This allows for better accuracy and more acute customization of the mold in the future.

This episode introduces the major characters and focuses on protagonist Bea Smith being introduced to and trying to fit into prison life, while flashbacks reveal her domestic abuse at the hands of her husband and the circumstances that result in her coming to Wentworth. Plot The episode begins with Bea Smith being transported to Wentworth Prison. Just after arriving, she witnesses another prisoner in the van giving a guard oral sex in exchange for cigarettes. Bea is then processed by Will Jackson; when she realizes she hasn't spoken to her daughter Debbie, she becomes hysterical and has to be sedated. The next day, Bea is taken to her unit by Deputy Governor Vera Bennett. Bea is shocked to find Franky Doyle and Kim Chang having sex in her cell. Franky, the head of her unit, mocks Bea's name, but shows interest upon learning that Bea is a hairdresser. Bea then meets the other members of the unit, including Liz Birdsworth, Sue \\"Boomer\\" Jenkins, and Doreen Anderson. Bea offends Doreen a little when she notes that she wouldn't want Debbie seeing the inside of a prison, as Doreen has her daughter Kaiya living in the unit with her. Franky intimidates Bea into acting as a drug mule, receiving a balloon from a stranger during a conjugal visit. Governor Meg Jackson, who is determined to crack down on drug trafficking, observes Bea taking the drugs on CCTV and eventually catches her with them. Bea refuses to implicate Franky and Meg decides to \\"slot\\" her in solitary, where Bea overhears Jacqueline \\"Jacs\\" Holt singing On the Inside (the theme song of Prisoner, the series that inspired Wentworth). Will arrives with breakfast the next morning and, during a smoke break, tells Bea that her silent approach is the best way to be, especially with the women. When Bea again refuses to implicate Franky, she is returned to the unit, having earned the respect of Franky and her crew. Meg, against the concerns of the staff and especially prisoner advocate Erica Davidson, releases Jacs from the slot early as another attempt to weaken Franky's hold on the drug trade. Jacs attempts to intimidate Bea and turn her into a servant, but Bea, remembering how her husband used to do the same, refuses to be cowed, humiliating Jacs in front of the other prisoners. Jacs then promises retribution against Franky, who set her up to be slotted. Franky, seeing Jacs as too big a threat to leave alone, rallies support to start a riot, despite Liz's objections. A massive fight breaks out in the yard and Doreen leaves Kaiya with Bea while she joins Franky. Jacs avoids the riot and is confronted in her cell by Franky, who is then overpowered by two of Jacs' crew. Jacs starts to cut off Franky's tattoos, but is stopped when Boomer intervenes. Bea loses track of Kaiya and, while searching for her, trips over a dead body, which turns out to be that of Meg Jackson. The episode ends with Will crying over his wife's body, while Bea, covered in Meg's blood, stands in shock. =Flashbacks= Bea is regularly subjected to physical and sexual abuse by her husband Harry, flashbacks of which are occasionally triggered by events in the present. Bea works up the courage to try and kill Harry by drugging him, tying him up in his car and filling the garage with exhaust fumes, but cannot bring herself to follow through and saves him while Debbie calls for an ambulance. Harry later tells the police that he was feeling suicidal, but continues to hit Bea when they are alone. Reception TV Equals described this episode as \\"Things have been changed to suit modern sensibilities, of course, and this updated series has been stripped of the campy sets, dialogue and black humour and populated instead with sex, violence and a heroine with a journey to go on. That‚Äôs Bea Smith, a woman whose been put away for the attempted murder of her abusive husband, and her experience in this first episode will surely inform her future trajectory up the hierarchy of her new surroundings. But first she‚Äôll have to contend with warring queen bees Franky and Jacs, whose confrontation this week results in the death of a warden.\\" An IMDb review claims that the end scene between Franky and Jacs is \\"beautifully staged and filmed, forming a dramatic crux, to a largely introductory episode.\\" It was said by Elaine Atwell writing for AfterEllen, \\" I tell you this not to scare you off, but to caution you that if you‚Äôre looking for a show to fill the OINTB-shaped hole in your heart, this one is actually likely to wound you much deeper. Anyway, welcome to Wentworth prison. Let‚Äôs jump right into the trauma, shall we?\\" John Crace writing for The Guardian stated \\"Just with more lesbians, more tattoos and more violence. And fewer sets that wobbled any time someone accidentally knocked into them. I can't believe this is the best drama being made in Australia right now, but I also can't believe that the only place in the whole prison without CCTV is the exact spot where Governor Jackson got knifed, shortly after snogging one of her wardens ‚Äì male, surprisingly ‚Äì in her office. It was also disturbing to find the lead character ‚Äì wrongly banged up, obviously ‚Äì looking like a young Rebekah Brooks. If you like this sort of thing, you're in for a treat. I rather preferred the wobbly sets.\\" Ian Hollingshead writing for The Telegraph said \\"The final showdown between Franky (Nicole da Silva) and Jacs (Kris McQuade), a young tattooed lesbian and a schoolmarmish matron, laced with malice as they fought over who would be top dog, was so compelling ‚Äì and the cliffhanger so agonising ‚Äì that it would be a crime to miss the next instalment.\\" =Ratings= Wentworth drew in 244,000 viewers for its premiere. Meanwhile, Foxtel spokesperson Jamie Campbell said that \\"more people watched Wentworth last night than any other Australian drama series premiere in Foxtel history\\".

He primarily plays as a centre. Parata currently plays for Italian side Zebre in the Pro14. He previously played for Irish provincial side Connacht, having come through the team's academy. Early life Parata was born in Sydney, Australia to a father from New Zealand and a mother from Ireland. His family moved to his mother's native County Cork when he was nine years old. Parata played rugby league from a young age in Australia, but after his family moved to Ireland he found he disliked the non-contact rugby union played at under-age with Dolphin. He instead played Gaelic football with Passage West and soccer instead, before returning to rugby at a later age. After returning to rugby Parata played with another Cork city-based club, this time Sundays Well. Parata attended St Peter's Community School in Passage West and Rockwell College in Cashel. He played for Rockwell in the Munster Schools Senior Cup and was part of the starting team beaten in the final by Crescent College in the final in 2013. Club career =Connacht= Parata played for the Munster under-18 clubs team, but moved to Irish rivals Connacht at under-19 level. He joined the Connacht academy ahead of the 2013‚Äì14 season. With the move to the west of Ireland, Parata also joined All-Ireland League team Galwegians. While he was playing with Galwegians, the club won successive promotions, ending up in Division 1A. Parata's first senior appearance for Connacht came in a preseason friendly against Wasps in August 2013. He did not feature for the senior team in his first two years in the academy, but featured for the second tier side, the Connacht Eagles, in the British and Irish Cup. In the 2013‚Äì14 competition, Parata started three games, was named on the bench for two and didn't feature in the other. In the following season he played in two of the British and Irish Cup games, one of these appearances coming as a start, and also played for the Eagles in a friendly with the German national team in January 2015. In the 2015‚Äì16 preseason Parata made his first start for Connacht, featuring against Grenoble, Castres and Munster in friendly matches. With first choice centre Robbie Henshaw away at the 2015 Rugby World Cup, Parata made his competitive debut for Connacht in the opening game of the 2015‚Äì16 Pro12, starting against the Newport Gwent Dragons on 4 September 2015. He made his first European appearance just over two months later, when he featured in Connacht's opening 2015‚Äì16 Challenge Cup fixture. Parata scored a try in the game away to Russian side Enisei-STM, which took place in the team's Siberian base of Krasnoyarsk. During the course of the season, he played a total of 12 Pro12 games and six in the Challenge Cup. It was announced in December 2016 that Parata had signed a senior contract with Connacht, becoming a full member of the province's first team squad in the 2016‚Äì17 season. He played fewer games in that season, making five appearances in the 2016‚Äì17 Pro12 and three in the Champions Cup. In April 2017, it was announced that Parata would leave the province at the end of the season. =Harbour Dunedin= After leaving Connacht, Parata travelled to his father's native New Zealand. He was one of a number of released Connacht players to make the journey, along with Ciar√°n Gaffney, Cian Romaine and Jack Dineen. In New Zealand Parata joined Harbour, an amateur team in the Dunedin Premier. While he was playing with them, the side reached the final of the competition, where they were beaten 24‚Äì15 by Southern. =Zebre= In January 2018, it was announced that Parata would return to the Pro14, having signed for Italian side Zebre for the remainder of the season. The move saw him link up with former Connacht head coach Michael Bradley and his former Connacht teammate Ciar√°n Gaffney. International career Parata has represented Ireland at under-age level, though he is also qualified to play for Australia by birth and New Zealand through his father. In 2013 he was selected for the Irish under-19 squad in games against England and France. In the first game he featured as a replacement, before starting at out-half against France the following week.

The origin of this name is thus related by Pausanias:Pausanias, Description of Greece 8.23.5 in the neighborhood of the town of Caphyae in Arcadia, in a place called Condylea, there was a sacred grove of Artemis Condyleatis. On one occasion when some boys were playing in this grove, they put a string around the goddess's statue, and said in their jokes they would strangle Artemis. Some of the inhabitants of Caphyae who found the boys engaged in their sport, stoned them to death. After this occurrence, all the women of Caphyae had premature births, and all the children were brought dead into the world. This calamity did not cease until the boys were honorably buried, and an annual sacrifice to their manes was instituted in accordance with the command of an oracle of Apollo. The epithet of Condyleatis was then changed into Apanchomene. Many modern scholars view this curious epithet as being related to Greek traditions where icons and puppets of a vegetation goddess would be hung in a tree (aiora). Classics scholar Helen King however connects the myth to beliefs about female reproductive health, and points to signs of Artemis being an asexual goddess.

Because Creston was on the mainline of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, and it was a divisional headquarters, it received a steady flow of visitors. Hotels that featured fireproof construction and modern amenities, such as this one, started to enter Iowa's secondary markets in the 1910s and 1920s. A group of local businessmen formed the Hotel Investment Company, and built the hotel. They hired the Chicago architectural firm H.L. Stevens & Company, known for its hotels, to design and build the Iowana. The building was constructed from 1919 to 1920. It served as Creston's primary hotel until about 1958 when more convenient and economical motels were built along the highway. By this time rail travel was declining and highway travel was increasing. The Hotel Investment Company sold the building in 1971. It continued in operation under various owners into the 1980s. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. It stood vacant for several years until it was transformed into an apartment building. The six-story brick building measures . A annex is located to the west. The upper floors are set back in the rear and form an L-shape. Over-all, the Early Commercial style structure is plain in appearance. The decorative details are found in the wide first floor windows of the commercial space that feature elliptical arches with cast stone spring blocks and keystones. Another decorative feature is found at the top of the building where a modified entablature incorporates the brick-framed windows and the stucco panels between them into the architrave. Above it is a simple brick wall that acts as a frieze and a cast stone cornice above it.

United States is a court case, originally filed in 2012, in which a group of American Samoans sued the State Department and the Obama administration. They sued to force the government to recognize American Samoans' birthright citizenship, arguing that the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that anyone born in the United States is automatically granted citizenship. The case originated as a complaint filed in 2012 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, by American Samoan and U.S. national Leneuoti Tuaua, who was prohibited from becoming a police officer in California because he was not a U.S. citizen. The case was docketed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 2013. Briefs were filed on May 12, 2014, and an oral argument was made on February 9, 2015. On June 5, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled 3‚Äì0 to deny birthright citizenship to American Samoans, ruling that the guarantee of such citizenship to citizens in the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to unincorporated U.S. territories. On February 1, 2016, attorneys filed a petition requesting that the Supreme Court of the United States review the Appeals Court's decision. On June 13, 2016, the Supreme Court denied certiorari, meaning the case will not be heard, and the lower court's ruling stands.

Works  Creager is the author of The Life of a Virus: Tobacco Mosaic Virus as an Experimental Model, 1930-1965 (University of Chicago Press, 2002), on snuff mosaic virus As the field of molecular biology developed, Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) became a paradigmatic experimental model for the study of viruses and the development of new scientific techniques. Creager's historical analysis explores TMV as a model system within the social and political cultures of mid-twentieth century biomedical research. It has been described as \\"a first-rate book by ... a scientist who has fluently assimilated the historian's tools\\". Creager has also written Atomic Life: A History of Radioisotopes in Science and Medicine (University of Chicago Press, 2013) on the use of radioisotopes in science and medicine. She analyzes ways in which knowledge and technology from the Manhattan Project were used in the fields of medicine and biology. The X-10 reactor at Oak Ridge was used to produce radioisotopes such as cobalt-60, phosphorus-32, sulfur-35, and carbon-14. As \\"Atoms for Peace\\", their use in medicine and biology was promoted by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Sensitive radioimmunoassay techniques were developed for diagnostic and medical use. Natural radioisotopes were used as tracers to track atoms and illuminate biological processes in living creatures and ecosystems. They were used to treat cancer, study DNA, and understand photosynthesis, among other breakthroughs.

Early life and career  Born in Palo Alto, California, in 1960, Siler grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and received a bachelor's degree in American Studies from Brown University in 1982, a master's from Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism in 1985, and an M.B.A. from Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management in 1991. While on assignment in London for BusinessWeek magazine, she did additional postgraduate work at the London School of Economics. She was a staff correspondent for BusinessWeek magazine in Los Angeles, Chicago, and London, and a staff writer for The Wall Street Journal in London. She has been a longtime contributor to The Wall Street Journal from the San Francisco Bay Area.  The House of Mondavi  In 2004, Siler wrote a front-page article for The Wall Street Journal titled, \\"Inside a Napa Valley Empire, a Family Struggles With Itself,\\" about how brothers Robert and Peter Mondavi's past battles imperiled the Robert Mondavi wine empire in California. In 2007, Siler published The House of Mondavi: The Rise and Fall of an American Wine Dynasty, a nonfiction account of four generations of the Mondavi family. The House of Mondavi concerns a repeating pattern of sibling conflict in a family wine business. The book details the 2004 board coup that led to the breakup and the forced sale of the publicly-traded Robert Mondavi company. The House of Mondavi revealed that patriarch Robert Mondavi's philanthropic gifts to the University of California at Davis and elsewhere had led to a personal financial crisis for the company, which was one of the factors leading to its $1 billion takeover. The book was a finalist for a Gerald Loeb Award for distinguished business and financial journalism in the category of business books in 2008. It was also a James Beard Foundation finalist that year in the category of books on wine and spirits. BusinessWeek picked it as one of the top ten business books of the year for 2007. New York Times wine writer Eric Asimov wrote about it: ‚ÄúCall it Greek tragedy or Shakespearean drama, Biblical strife, Freudian acting out or even soap opera. You wouldn‚Äôt be exaggerating, and you wouldn‚Äôt be wrong.\\" It also received criticism for focusing on the salacious.  Lost Kingdom  In 2011, Siler published Lost Kingdom: Hawaii's Last Queen, the Sugar Kings, and America's First Imperial Adventure, a narrative history of the overthrow of Hawaii's Queen Liliuokalani. Lost Kingdom was a 2011 Northern California bestseller. It was also a New York Times bestseller. In Fortune magazine, Nin-Hai Tseng wrote ‚ÄúThe story of an island grappling to hold onto traditions in the face of burgeoning capitalist powers‚Ä¶Siler gives us a riveting and intimate look at the rise and tragic fall of Hawaii‚Äôs royal family.\\" The White Devil's Daughters  In May of 2019, Alfred A.

In response to the unrest in Saddam City, Saddam Hussein's son Qusay Hussein led a siege of the district, with dissent being repressed. Baghdad as a whole remained quiet, with the capital serving not as a center for the uprisings, but as a staging-post for the government counter- offensive. The Saddam City unrest Whilst the uprisings saw the Iraqi Government lose control over 14 of Iraq's 18 provinces in March 1991, Baghdad remained largely passive. This was in part due to the fact that the Dawa Party, the Communist Party, and the pro-Syrian Ba'ath splinter party had all failed to build underground structures in the capital. Instead, the unrest within Baghdad was limited to the vast suburban Shia-populated slum of Saddam City, which by 1991 had a population of 1 million, and which was a stronghold of Shiite cleric Mohammad Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr. Baghdad also saw more limited unrest due to the fact that strict government control over the media and communication prevented the full scale of the Iraqi defeat in the Gulf War being apparent to the residents of Baghdad, who unlike the residents of southern Iraq, had not witnessed the Iraqi defeat unravel on their doorstep. Whilst many parts of the country which also saw some degree of power vacuum, the Iraqi government maintained a large security presence within Baghdad. In response to the uprising Qusay Hussein led a government siege of the district. Some 7,000 troops were transferred to Baghdad on 4 March in order to augment the city's defenses, and the Iraqi Government would declare a state of emergency in Baghdad on 21 March. Aftermath Following the uprising, Saddam stationed an elite Special Republican Guard battalion (the 10th Battalion) at the al-Rashid barracks near to Saddam City. The battalion was charged with sealing off and indiscriminately bombarding the district in the case of future revolts, in a manner similar to the Republican Guard actions in Najaf and Karbala.p.6 References External links * The 1991 Uprising in Iraq And Its Aftermath * Uprising Anniversary Saddam City Saddam City Saddam City Basra Category:20th century in Baghdad Saddam City Saddam City Saddam City Category:Rebellions in Iraq Category:Iraqi war crimes Category:March 1991 events in Asia ","title":"Battle of Saddam City"},{"id":"49467202","text":"The New Year Honours 1898 were appointments by Queen Victoria to various orders and honours to reward and highlight good works by members of the British Empire.

The model rests on three conditions that influence the path, speed, and outcomes of self-organizing processes in complex adaptive systems. These conditions are necessary and sufficient to create patterns that emerge and can be perceived in all kinds of complex adaptive systems. Depending on the interactions of those conditions, the emergence process and its outcomes can be fast or slow, direct or meandering, and ambiguous or clear. The same conditions can be intentionally changed to influence the current situation and emerging future patterns of the system. The three conditions are therefore described as the Eoyang CDE Model. Eoyang CDE Model * C: Container. Any feature of the system that holds agents together until system-wide patterns form can function as a system container. Large or loose containers lead to slow and ambiguous self-organizing processes. Small, tight containers set conditions for faster and clearer emergence. Examples of containers include physical containers: rooms, buildings, geographic areas, etc. Psychological or contextual containers include relationships, charismatic leaders, ideology, shared beliefs, etc. Organizational or structural containers include departments and offices‚Äîeven agendas can be containers. * D: Difference. Diversity or energy that is important to the system can help to shape patterns. Few or small differences contribute to slow and subtle pattern formation. Many or large differences may contribute to disruptions that are apparently random. Differences that are few in number, but significant in size, are most likely to generate patterns that are timely and clear. * E: Exchange. The connections that transfer energy, information, or resources across differences within a container are considered to be exchanges. Tight exchanges create fast and predictable changes, while loose exchanges set conditions for slow and unpredictable change. Examples include: speaking and listening, feedback and data, money exchanges, shared event or opportunities, etc. In 2003, Eoyang founded The Human Systems Dynamics Institute (HSDI) to develop the theory and practice of human systems dynamic. As a not-for-profit organization (501c3) located in the US, the institute invests in research and education around the globe to help individuals and organizations cope with complexity and uncertainty.

History Quadracycle for two. John Kemp Starley, a 19th-century English inventor is often considered the inventor of the modern bicycle. He began producing the Rover Safety Bicycle in 1885. In the late 19th century, the city of Coventry was the largest producer of bicycles in the world. The National Clarion Cycling Club, which has member sections across the country, was started in the 1890s and was instrumental in the promotion of the socialist movement as well as the growth in popularity of cycling. Utility cycling The numbers of people commuting to work by bicycle increased by 17% to 760,000 in England and Wales between 2001 and 2011, a total proportion of 2.9% of all commuters. At the governmental level, cycling is a responsibility of the Department for Transport. Cycling UK advocates in the areas of utility and recreational cyclists, as opposed to cycle sport which is governed by British Cycling. Initiatives such as the Cycle to Work scheme are designed to encourage cycling as a mode of transport, particularly for its environmental benefits against automobile use. The DfT administers the Bikeability national cycle training programme, which educates both children and adults in bike handling skills and safe cycling on public roads. Segregated Bicycle Paths These are being installed in some cities in the UK such as London, Glasgow, Manchester, Bristol, Cardiff for example. In London Transport for London has the Cycle Superhighways. https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/routes-and- maps/cycle-superhighways Cycle routes The National Cycle Network, created by the charity Sustrans, is the UK's major network of signed routes for cycling. It uses dedicated bike paths as well as roads with minimal traffic, and covers , passing within of half of all homes. Other cycling routes such as The National Byway, the Sea to Sea Cycle Route and local cycleways can be found across the country. Cycle sport The governing organisations for cycle sport in the UK is British Cycling and Cycling Ireland. The 21st century has seen a dramatic increase in the performance of British cyclists at the top levels of international cycling. Great Britain dominated the medal tables in cycling at the 2008, 2012 and 2016 Olympics, while riders such as Bradley Wiggins, Mark Cavendish and Chris Froome have recorded multiple wins in professional road races such as the Tour de France. Major professional road races include the Tour of Britain, the Tour de Yorkshire, The Women's Tour and the London‚ÄìSurrey Classic. On the track, the Revolution series events are most prominent. London hosted the 2016 UCI Track Cycling World Championships. The Tour de France included stages in Britain in 1974, 1994, 2007 and 2014. =Velodromes and other permanent tracks= There are five Olympic-size indoor velodromes in Britain: the Olympic Velodrome in Lee Valley VeloPark, Manchester Velodrome, the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, Wales National Velodrome and Derby Arena. The National Indoor BMX Arena is located at the National Cycling Centre in Manchester. Leisure and mass-participation cycling events Well-known regular events amateur and leisure cyclists include RideLondon and the Dunwich Dynamo. More than 100,000 people took part in cyclosportives in 2014.  Rules  Cyclists may not use the British motorway network Cyclists cannot use certain roads in the United Kingdom, most notably Motorways. Further, some roads can be marked off-limits to cyclists by the presence of either a No Cycling sign (a bicycle in a red circle), or a No Vehicles sign (an empty red circle). In the latter case, cycles may be pushed. Other than these restrictions, cyclists can use any public highway in the United Kingdom, such as A roads (including dual carriageways). The use of dedicated cycle facilities is not compulsory, and use \\"depends on your experience and skills\\". However, riding on the pavement is illegal. Bicycles must furthermore be road-worthy, which in Great Britain means that the bicycle must have \\"two efficient braking systems\\" that operate independently on both wheels. This includes fixed-gear bicycles, where backwards pressure on the pedals acts as a brake, so only a front brake is required in this case. For riding in the hours of darkness between sunset and sunrise, cyclists must have at least a red rear light and a white front light, as well as a red rear reflector and four amber pedal reflectors (one at the back and one at the front on each pedal).

Early years Evelyn Dove studied singing, piano, and elocution at the Royal Academy of Music from 1917 until 1919, when she graduated, and on 27 September that year married Milton Alphonso Luke in London. Howard Rye records that she was using the name \\"Norma Winchester\\" when she became a member of the Southern Syncopated Orchestra (SSO), a band composed of British West Indian and West African and American musicians who were popularising black music on the UK club scene.\\"London's jazz legends ‚Äî Southern Syncopated Orchestra\\", BBC, 24 September 2014.

Dove and other SSO survivors such as Cyril Blake took part on 14 October in the \\"Survivors Sacred Concert\\". When in 1925 the all-Black revue Chocolate Kiddies toured Europe from New York, she joined the cast, replacing Lottie Gee,Chip Deffaa, Voices of the Jazz Age: Profiles of Eight Vintage Jazzmen, Illini Books/University of Illinois Press, 1992, p. 14. who had to return to the US, and the show toured western Europe for a year, before going to the USSR to play in Leningrad and Moscow, where the audience included Stalin, according to Stephen Bourne, who has researched and written about Dove for the Dictionary of National Biography and elsewhere. Dove's career burgeoned internationally in the 1920s and '30s. She was performing at London's Mile End Empire in June 1926, then five months later Evelyn Dove and Her Plantation Creoles ‚Äì \\"the only singing and dancing act of its kind in Europe\\" ‚Äì appeared at Wintergarten in Berlin, and her revue appeared in the Netherlands in February 1927. She was very popular in Italy, where she lived for some years, before in 1932 going to France to replace Josephine Baker starring in a revue at the Casino de Paris.Stephen Bourne, \\"The Untold Story Of Britain‚Äôs First Black Female Superstar\\", The Voice, 30 March 2017. She subsequently went to the US, where in 1936 she was the headline cabaret act at the famous Harlem nightclub Connie's Inn. In New York she was photographed by the celebrated photographer Carl Van Vechten.\\"Evelyn Dove wearing a mantilla and carrying a folding fan\\". Photograph by Carl Van Vechten, 27 December 1935. Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library. Her travels also took her to Bombay, India, where on 7 October 1937 The Evening News of India reviewed her opening night performance at the Harbour Bar: \\"She is an artist of international reputation, one of the leading personalities of Europe's entertainment world. She is described as the closest rival of the great Josephine Baker herself. Evelyn didn't get just the big hand. She got an ovation, a roaring welcome.\\" 1939‚Äì49 The decade from 1939 to 1949 marked the height of Dove's career in Britain, when she did much notable radio work broadcasting with the BBC. As Stephen Bourne has written: \\"Throughout World War II she enjoyed the same appeal as the 'Forces Sweetheart', Vera Lynn. The BBC employed Evelyn all through the war, and she proved to be one of radio‚Äôs most popular singers, appearing in a wide range of music and variety programmes.\\" A memo from producer Eric Fawcett to a colleague on 6 June 1947 states: \\"She is a contralto with a perfect microphone quality and although I have used her mostly in music of negro origin this has ranged from spirituals to Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. She is, of course, a highly trained singer. She is an extremely charming person with a very attractive personality.

She appeared regularly on such popular music and variety radio programmes as Rhapsody in Black, Calling the West Indies, Variety Bandbox, Music For You, Caribbean Carnival, and Mississippi Nights.Radio Times listings, BBC. Particularly successful was the series Serenade in Sepia (1945‚Äì47), for which she made more than 50 broadcasts with Trinidadian folk-singer Edric Connor, attracting so many listeners that the BBC decided to make a television version.Stephen Bourne, Black in the British Frame: The Black Experience in British Film and Television, Continuum, 2001, pp. 62, 82. In 1947 Dove and Connor ‚Äì along with other artists including Mable Lee, Cyril Blake and his Calypso Band, Buddy Bradley, Winifred Atwell, and Adelaide Hall ‚Äì performed in Variety in Sepia, an early example of a UK television special dedicated to Black talent, which was filmed live on 7 October 1947 at the RadiOlympia Theatre, Alexandra Palace, London, and aired on BBC TV.\\"Variety in Sepia (1947)\\", Internet Movie Database. Later career Leaving the BBC in 1949, Dove worked in cabaret in India, Paris and Spain. When she returned to Britain at the end of 1950, as Stephen Bourne has written, she struggled to find work, \\"though she did appear in the cast of London Melody with ice-skater Belita and comedian Norman Wisdom at London's Empress Hall in 1951. Despite her experience and talent, she found herself understudying Muriel Smith in the role of Bloody Mary in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical South Pacific at Drury Lane.\\" In 1955, her search for work led her to apply for a job as a Post Office telephonist, asking the BBC for a reference. In 1956 the BBC cast her as Eartha Kitt's mother in a television drama called Mrs Patterson, and more television work followed, and then a role on the West End musical stage, as one of the stars of Langston Hughes's Simply Heavenly, directed by Laurence Harvey. Bourne notes that another cast member was Isabelle Lucas, who later recalled: \\"We became friends, but Evelyn's life took a bad turn. Her reputation as a singer faded, and she became very ill. She lost contact with her family. Her spirit was broken.\\" Evelyn Dove died of pneumonia at Horton Hospital in Epsom, Surrey, aged 85, on 7 March 1987, registered as \\"Evelyn Dove, otherwise Brantley\\" (she had married her third husband William Newton Brantley, in 1958, having previously been married to Felix John Basil Inglis Allen in 1941).\\"Evelyn Mary Luke (born Dove), 1902 ‚Äì 1987\\" at MyHeritage.

Kwok-ming steps in to assist in hunting the criminals, but Sammi was hit by a stray bullet and was seriously injured, leading her into a coma. Several months later, Sammi awakes from her coma.

Since Kwok-ming is often busy and handling cases at the police station, Sammi is left home along to recover and have been hallucinating often lately. One time, Sammi sees a female celebrity, Kitty Chow (Tiffany Lee), killed in her hallucination. While being skeptical, Sammi walks into the back alley of a bar and discovers the corpse of Kitty. Since then, Sammi's mental became more severe. When Kwok-ming wanted to take a leave at the police station, his supervisor demands him to cancel all his leaves and investigate the case of Kitty Chow's murder. One night, Kwok-ming returns home and sees the walls being covered in words written with blood. The same night, Sammi also goes mad and heads into the road, causing serious traffic congestion. Afterwards, Sammi was taken to hospital to be examined by a psychiatrist. Meanwhile, Kwok-ming was investigating another case where a lawyer was murdered and discovers that the case is linked to the murder of Kitty Chow. While the crime scene, Kwok-ming shockingly witnesses the lawyer coming back to life and takes him to the hospital.

Lognon, Obituaires de la province de Sens Tome I (Diocese de Sens) (Paris 1902), p. 18 (16 August): hic debet fieri sollempne anniversarium bone memorie Symonis, cardinalis, quondam fratris venerabilis in Christo patris Johannis de Bello-loco, abbatis ecclesie nostre. Gallia christiana XII (Paris 1770), p. 152. Simon had another brother, Raoul, who was also buried (1286) at Jouy along with their mother.Piganiol de la Force, pp. 65-70. Early career Simon studied at the University of Paris. He enjoyed the title of Magister. Simon de Beaulieu became Archdeacon of ChartresP. Glorieux, p. 33, in a document of the year 1276. and of Poitiers. He was a Canon of the Cathedral Chapter of Bourges and of S. Martin de Tours. He was Administrator of the abbey of Notre-Dame de la Charit√© √† Besan√ßon. On 17 August 1276, Master Simon was commissioned (subdelegatus) by Cardinal Simon de Brion, the Papal Legate in France, to handle the case of the Masters of the Sorbonne, which had already begun, but which had been interrupted by the death of Master Nicholas, Treasurer of the Church of Ch√¢lons. Simon renewed the citations addressed to the Bishop of Paris and the Bailly, warning them either to produce their arguments by 16 November, or their charges would be dismissed.P. Glorieux, p. 33 and pp. 399-400 no. 335. He was also given the case of the Sorbonne and the monastery of S. Genevi√®ve, which had similarly been interrupted. His report to the Cardinal survives in a document dated 6 March 1277.P. Glorieux, p. 33 and p. 402-404, no. 337 and 339; pp. 409-411 no. 344. In another report of 10 March 1277, he reports progress in the case against the Canons of S. Beno√Æt for molesting the Masters of the Sorbonne.P. Glorieux, pp. 411-413, no. 345. Despite Master Simon's work, however, these cases dragged on, and in September, 1279, Cardinal Simon was recalled by the Pope.P. Glorieux, p. 34. Archbishop (1281-1294) In 1281 Simon de Beaulieu was appointed Archbishop of Bourges by Pope Martin IV (Simon de Brion). After the death of Archbishop Guy on 5 March 1281, the Chapter of the Cathedral decided to proceed to an election of a successor by means of a compromise. The committee chose Jean de Soliaco, a fellow canon, but when his case came before Pope Martin IV for confirmation, he resigned the election. Pope Martin thereupon 'preferred' Magister Simon de Beaulieu.Denis Sammarthani, Gallia christiana II (Paris 1720), p. 73, and Instrumenta, p. 25. His election was confirmed by Pope Martin IV (Simon de Brion) on 23 December 1281, in a letter to the Canons of the Cathedral of Bourges.Augustus Potthast, Regesta pontificum Romanorum II (Berlin 1875), no. 21825. Conradus Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii aevi I, editio altera (Monasterii 1913), p. 138. The post of Archbishop of Bourges made Archbishop Simon the Primate of Aquitaine, with supervisory powers over all the bishops of (modern) southwestern France.L. de Lacger, Revue d'histoire de l'Eglise de France 23 (1937), 29-50. The Province of Aquitanica Prima included: Bourges, Clermont, Rodez, Albi, Cahors, Limoges, Mende, and Le Puy; Aquitanica Secunda included: Bordeaux, Agen, Engoul√™me, Saintes, Poitiers and Perigueux. Archbishop Simon was eager and active in carrying out visitations in his own diocese as well as in those of the other bishops of his ecclesiastical province. Between September and November, 1284, the Archbishop conducted a visitation of the diocese of Bordeaux.F. Delivr√©, RM 74 (2002) 133-160. J. D. Mansi, Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio Tomus 24 (Venice 1780), pp. 649-766. In 1285-1286, he visited the diocese of Cahors.E. Depeyre, Visites du dioc√®se de Cahors par Simon de Beaulieu, archev√™que de Bourges, 1285-1286, 1290-1291 (Cahors: F. Delp√©rier, 1901). In September, 1286, Archbishop Simon held an ecclesiastical Council at Bourges with his suffragan bishops, Guy of Clermont, Gilbert of Limoges, Rainaldus of Cahors, Bernard of Albi, and Raimundus of Rodez.Joannes Dominicus Mansi, Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio Tomus 24 (Venice 1780), pp. 625-648. The Council produced thirty-seven statutes, many derived from papal documents and those of the onetime Papal Legate, Cardinal Simon de Brion. In 1290-1291, Archbishop Simon again visited the diocese of Cahors.E. Depeyre, Visites du dioc√®se de Cahors par Simon de Beaulieu, archev√™que de Bourges, 1285-1286, 1290-1291 (Cahors: F. Delp√©rier, 1901). Cardinal Archbishop Simon was created cardinal by Pope Celestine V in the Consistory of 18 September 1294, and appointed Cardinal Bishop of the Suburbicarian See of Palestrina.Eubel, p. 11. Cardinal Simon participated in the very brief Conclave of 23‚Äì24 December 1294, which was held at Naples after the resignation of Celestine V on 13 December. Cardinal Benedetto Caetani was elected on the first scrutiny, and took the throne name Boniface VIII.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante and Conclave, December 1294. retrieved 02/18/2016.  Embassy to France and England (1295-1297)  On 18 February 1295, Pope Celestine's successor, Boniface VIII (Benedetto Caetani), appointed Cardinal B√©rard de Got and Cardinal Simon de Beaulieu as Nuncios to King Edward I of England and King Philip IV of France to do everything possible to arrange a peace in the conflict that had broken out in the previous year. Next day the Pope sent a letter to King Edward, advising him of the appointment, and apologizing that he had not done it sooner, due to the dangerous roads between Naples, where he had been elected, and Rome, where he was crowned on January 23, 1295.Augustus Potthast, Regesta pontificum Romanorum II (Berlin 1875), nos. 24026-24027. The two ambassadors, B√©rard de Got and Simon de Beaulieu, arrived in London around the time of Pentecost,In a letter of 28 April 1295, to Cardinal B√©rard de Got, King Edward expresses his happiness that the Cardinal has arrived in his domains. Thomas Rymer, Foedera, Conventiones, Literae et cujuscunque generis Acta Publica Tomus II (London: A. and J. Churchill, 1705), p. 679. where they awaited the King's return from Wales, which came around August 1. The Cardinals presented the King with a request for a truce of two years. The King replied that treaty obligations to the King of the Romans forbade him to make a truce or peace without his consent. The Cardinals asked the King to obtain it, and he agreed to do so. On 14 August, the King wrote directly to Pope Boniface, rehearsing the same difficulties as well as his immense willingness. On the same day he signed a document authorizing the two Cardinals to treat for a truce with King Philip.Rymer, p. 685-686. The Cardinals returned to France around September 8, 1295.'Thomas of Walsingham', Historia Anglicana, p. 51. On 22 June 1295, Pope Boniface mentioned in a letter to his ambassadors to King Adolf that he had ratified a truce (treuga, not a peace) among Edward I, Philip IV, and Adolf, King of the Romans.Potthast, no. 24107. On 13 April 1296, the Pope approved another truce among the three Kings, to begin on 24 June 1296.Potthast, no. 24315. On 21 April 1296, Boniface ordered the two cardinals to publish in France and England his Constitution on Ecclesiastical Liberties, Clericis laicos, which he had signed in February.Potthast, no.24321 and 24386. In the Spring of 1296, Cardinal B√©rard de Got returned to England alone, but was unable to extract any promise of peace from King Edward, who was eagerly pursuing his Scottish war. He left Cardinal Simon de Beaulieu in France to deal with King Philip on his own, as the conflict between King and Pope intensified. On 18 August, Pope Boniface repeated his order to the two cardinals to publish Clericis Laicos in England and France.Potthast, no. 24386. Marrone and Zuckerman, pp. 210-217. On 25 September, he wrote directly to King Philip, complaining about Philip's ingratitude in the face of the Pope's efforts to restrain King Adolf from invading his kingdom, and notifying him that he was sending an ambassador, Guillaume de Falgariis, O.Min., Bishop of Viviers, to compose their differences.Potthast, no. 24398. On 30 September Pope Boniface renewed the Bull Clericis Laicos and warned King Philip that, unless he did what the Pope wanted, the Pope was prepared to suffer not only persecutions but even death itself for the sake of the liberty of the Church.Potthast, no. 24404. A. Theiner (ed.), Caesaris Baronii Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus 23 (Bar-le-Duc 1871), under year 1296, ¬ß 25, pp. 193-196 (\\"Ineffabilis amoris\\"). Philip retaliated by forbidding the exportation of money, horses or arms from France without a royal licence. On 7 February 1297, Pope Boniface complained about Philip's general edict.Potthast, no. 24468. Baronius-Theiner, under year 1297, ¬ß 46, pp. 217-218. Two days later the Pope wrote to the two cardinals, that, if Philip or any of his agents should attempt to impede the flow of money or supplies for the Crusade, they should be publicly denounced and made subject to canonical penalties.Potthast, 24469. Dupuy, \\"Preuves\\", p. 25. On 20 April 1297, Cardinal B√©rard and Cardinal Simon issued a joint declaration that they had attempted to treat with King Philip face to face about the truce which had expired on 24 June, and that they wanted to acquaint the King with Pope Boniface's proposals for its extension. Before the letter of the Pope could be read out, King Philip made a formal protest that no one could dictate to him about the temporal affairs of his realm. The cardinals at that point could only publish the truce, its prorogation, and the letters of Pope Boniface.Dupuy, \\"Preuves\\", pp. 27-28. The documents were signed at Credulium in the Diocese of Beauvais. On 11 August 1297, Louis IX of France, grandfather of Philip IV, became Saint Louis in a ceremony held at Orvieto by Pope Boniface VIII.Potthast, nos. 24560-24562. Death Cardinal Simon de Beaulieu died at Orvieto on 18 August 1297, and was buried in the Franciscan church, before the High Altar.F. Ughelli and N. Colet, Italia sacra, editio secunda Tomus I (Venice 1717), p. 213, quoting the funeral inscription. Eubel, p. 11, n. 11, states that he died at Civitavecchia (apud Civitatem vetulam), rather than Orvieto (Urbs vetula)‚Äîa slip of the pen. Even after his death, Cardinal Simon continued to play a part in the struggle between Philip the Fair and Boniface VIII. It was alleged by the persecutors of Boniface VIII in the famous posthumous trial of 1310-1311 that Cardinal Simon had warned Philip IV that Boniface had been accused of heresy and that Boniface had tricked Pope Celestine out of the papacy. Cardinal Simon, however, was a supporter and defender of Pope Boniface during his lifetime, and such charges are completely unconvincing.Dunbabin, p. 206. The same imputations could not be placed on the other Nuncio, Cardinal B√©rard de Got, since he had been the brother of Pope Clement V (Bertrand de Got). Cardinal Simon, therefore, was made to bear the burden of being a posthumous false witness.

History  Daily Table was founded in 2012 by Doug Rauch, the former president of Trader Joe's. The not-for-profit company aims to sell healthy food at a price point suitable for working poor families. It is designed to compete with fast food restaurants. Daily Table sells inexpensive produce and pre-packaged meals. Its prices are significantly lower than the lowest options at a traditional grocery store. The company is able to achieve these prices by sourcing foods close to their \\"sell-by\\" expiration dates. Distributors of these foods would prefer to donate or discount these products before discarding them. Daily Table considers itself the first not-for-profit supermarket of its kind.

Strictly speaking, the Forest Tradition of Ajahn Chah denotes the institutions who have a branch affiliation with Wat Pah Pong, the administrative center of the organization. History =Ajahn Chah's early training= Ajahn JayasƒÅro relates that while many Mahanikai monks would reordain in the Dhammayut order as an act of devotion to Ajahn Mun, a handful of other followers of Ajahn Mun would choose to stay Mahanikai monks. Luang Por Thongrat Ajahn Jayasaro relates that Ajahn Thongrat was considered \\"Zen Like\\", in the sense that he was very \\"Vigorous and outspoken ‚Äî and outrageous ‚Äî in his behaviour. Which of course in Thai monastic idiom, where etiquette and good behavior is so stressed, it quite made him stand out.\\" Little is known of Ajahn Chah's relationship with Ajahn Thongrat, though Ajahn Chah relates a story about the first time he had met Ajahn Thongrat. Upon hearing of Ajahn Thongrat's whereabouts, Ajahn Chah traveled a long distance to meet Ajahn Thongrat. When Ajahn Chah walked into the monastery where Ajahn Thongrat was staying, Ajahn Thongrat looked at Ajahn Chah for the first time and said \\"Oh, Chah! You've arrived at last!\\", which surprised Ajahn Chah, because there should have been no way that Ajahn Thongrat knew who Ajahn Chah was or that he was coming. Ajahn Kinnari Ajahn Chah met Ajahn Kinnari while wandering dhutanga. Ajahn Jayasaro talks about how when dhutanga monks encounter each other, they will sometimes relate information about good spots to meditate, or good monasteries or meditation teachers. Establishment of Wat Pah Pong Prior to establishing monasteries, Ajahn Chah wandered Dhutanga for 7 years, practicing in wilderness areas, caves and cremation grounds. After that period, he settled in a \\"fever ridden, haunted forest\\" known as \\"Pah Pong\\", and drew a following from there. A monastery was formed in the area, known today as Wat Pah Pong, in spite of poor living conditions and sparse food. In 1967, Venerable Sumedho came to stay with Ajahn Chah at Wat Pah Pong. He found out about the monastery from one of Ajahn Chah's existing monks who happened to speak \\"a little bit of english\\". =Taking root in the west= Thailand The first Thai monastery run by and for English-speaking monks was Wat Pah Nanachat which is located in Northeast Thailand about 15 kilometres from the city of Ubon Rachathani, founded in 1975. England Chithurst Buddhist Monastery or Cittaviveka was the first English monastery. In 1976, Ajahn Sumedho met George Sharp, Chairman of the English Sangha Trust. The Trust had been established in 1956 for the purpose of establishing a suitable residence for the training of Buddhist monks in England. By the 1970s, the Trust possessed a property in Hampstead that was not yet deemed suitable for what was desired. During a brief stay in London in 1978, Ajahn Sumedho, while undertaking the traditional alms round of Theravada monks (on Hampstead Heath), encountered a lone jogger who was struck by the Bhikkhu's outlandish attire. The jogger had, by chance, just acquired a piece of overgrown woodland in West Sussex. After expressing an interest in Buddhism, the gentleman attended a ten-day retreat at the Oaken Holt Buddhist Center near Oxford after which he offered the forest as a gift to the Sangha. In 1979, George Sharp purchased Chithurst House (a property adjacent to the wood) on behalf of The English Sangha Trust. Chithurst House gained legal recognition as a monastery in 1981. The monastery was named Cittaviveka, a Pali word meaning \\"the mind of non-attachment\\". Harnham Buddhist Monastery, Aruna Ratanagiri was founded in June of the same year. Amaravati Buddhist Monastery (now the main headquarters of the U.K. monasteries) was established in 1984 and formally opened in 1985. A fourth location is The Forest Hermitage (Santidhamma & Bhavanadhamma) (founded by Ajahn Khemadhammo). United States In the 1980s Ajahn Sumedho started getting requests to teach in California. Visits by either himself or one of his senior monks or nuns resulted in the Sanghapala Foundation being set up in 1988. A plot of about north of Ukiah, California was given directly to Ajahn Sumedho by Chan Master Hsuan Hua, founder of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas in Talmage, California, before he died in 1995, would become Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery. Currently, the monastery rests on of mountainous forest land. Other western countries The Thai Forest Tradition also exists in: * Australia (Buddha Bodhivana Monastery, Bodhisaddha Forest Monastery, BodhipƒÅla Monastery, Dhammagiri Forest Monastery, Vimokkharam Forest Hermitage, Wat Buddha Dhamma ) * Brazil (SuddhavƒÅri Monastery) * Canada (Tisarana Buddhist Monastery, Arrow River Forest Hermitage, Birken Forest Monastery) * New Zealand (Bodhinyanarama Monastery and Vimutti Buddhist Monastery) * Switzerland (Kloster Dhammapala monastery) * Germany (Muttodaya Waldkloster Forest Monastery, Metta Vihara and Anenja Vihara) * Italy (Santacittarama monastery) * Norway (Lokuttara Vihara (Skiptvet Buddhist Monastery)) * Portugal (Sumedharamahttps://sumedharama.pt/projecto-2/) * Slovenia (Samanadipa Forest Hermitage) =The Order of Siladhara= Establishment The Siladhara Order is a Theravada Buddhist female monastic order established by Ajahn Sumedho at Chithurst Buddhist Monastery, England. In 1983, he obtained permission from the Sangha in Thailand, to give a ten-precept pabbajja to the women, making them officially recognized female renunciants trained in the Ajahn Chah lineage. The reasons for its establishment are due to the historical loss of the bhikkhuni (nun's) ordination in Theravada Buddhism. The female monastic community began in 1979, when Chithurst Monastery admitted four Western women as anagƒÅrikƒÅs. From 1979-1983 the women lived in a cottage a short walk from the main house, on the edge of Chithurst forest. In 1983, Ajahn Sumedho ordained the nuns as 10 Precept sƒ´ladhƒÅrƒÅ nuns at Chithurst. In 1984 the order outgrew the cottage, and the nuns community moved to Amaravati. According to the Forest Sangha newsletter: \\"Some years later a small group of nuns returned to Chithurst Monastery to establish a second sƒ´ladhƒÅrƒÅ community there.\\" Milntuim House In 2012, another center for the Siladharas was purchased in Perthshire, Scotland, known as the Milntuim House. Ajahn Candasiri writes: =2009 Ordination at Bodhinyana= On 22 October 2009 Ajahn Brahm facilitated an ordination ceremony for bhikkhunis where four female Buddhists, Venerable Ajahn Vayama, and Venerables Nirodha, Seri and Hasapanna, were ordained into Ajahn Brahm's lineage. The ordination ceremony took place at Ajahn Brahm's Bodhinyana Monastery at Serpentine (near Perth, WA), Australia. For his actions of 22 October 2009, on 1 November 2009, at a meeting of senior members of the Thai monastic sangha, held at Wat Pah Pong, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand, Brahm was removed from the Ajahn Chah Forest Sangha lineage and is no longer associated with the main monastery in Thailand, Wat Pah Pong, nor with any of the other Western Forest Sangha branch monasteries of the Ajahn Chah tradition.ASIA: WA Buddhist temple banned after ordination of female monks.

Publication history Marvel began publishing a comic series titled Wolverine and the X-Men in 2011, but the series ended when the lead character died in 2014. Writer Elliott Kalan and artist Marco Failla continued the storyline, replacing Wolverine with Spider-Man. This volume lasted six issues from December 2014 to April 2015. A trade paperback collecting all six issues was released August 4, 2015. Synopsis Following the death of Wolverine, Spider-Man honors a request in his will to become a faculty member at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning and tries to teach ethics to troubled students. At the same time, he secretly investigates the students because Wolverine asked him to locate a traitor. After a number of unrelated fights and adventures, one of his students, Ernst, reveals that she made a deal with the evil Mister Sinister in an effort to help No-Girl. Sinister betrays Ernst, who then works with her classmates and Spider-Man to defeat Sinister and save nearby civilians. Because of their teamwork, no one is expelled from the school and the students are allowed to go on weekly patrols with Spider-Man. Critical reception Spider-Man and the X-Men #1 sold 61,952 copies the month of release, making it the 14th best selling issue in December 2014. It received an average score of 6.9/10 based on 20 reviews according to review aggregator Comic Book Roundup.

It comes under Nagamangala gram panchayat in Chikkaballapura district. Geography Nadipinayakanahalli is located 27 km south-east of Chikballapur, the district's headquarters, and 64 km from the state capital Bangalore. Surrounding cities and towns include Vijayapura to the west, Hoskote and Devanahalli to the south, and Sidlaghatta and Chintamani to the north. Demographics The population of the village ranges from 1000 to 1200. Most of the village inhabitants are farmers and are lower middle class. The literacy rate is above 80% thanks to the successful implementation of schemes such as Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and illiteracy eradication schemes. Most of the village children attend Navodaya school, a government-run school located in the village. Others attend schools in Jangamakote Cross, near Jangamakote, and Vijayapura. Occupation Sericulture and agriculture are the two major occupations, with 90% of the working population rearing silkworms. Men in this area are famously hard working. Ragi is the main crop during the rainy season. Edible fruits and vegetables such as beetroot, carrot, cabbage, grapes, potato, mango, banana, cucumber, watermelon, cashew nuts, papaya, jack fruit, and jambu are also farmed. Mulberry plants are prolific in the village. Water is scarce in Nadipinayakanahalli. Village inhabitants have invested in bore wells, and agricultural land has been converted to drought land because of the scarcity of water. Drip irrigation is commonly used to water plants. The lake at the end of the village covers an area of approximately 150 to 250 acres. The lake partially fills during the rainy season when rain water is collected, but is drained within days. Desperate farmers cultivate the land during the rainy season to produce ragi. This practice is strictly prohibited by the state government. ‡≤∞‡≤æ‡≤ó‡≤ø ‡≤¨‡≥Ü‡≤≥‡≥Ü‡≤Ø ‡≤™‡≥à‡≤∞‡≥Å View of Ragi crops plantation from the peaks of the village Domestic life Dairy farming (cattle rearing) is widely practiced and is a secondary source of income for average middle-class families. Two non-indigenous breeds, Holstein Frisian and Jersey, are favored because of their high production of milk. Indigenous (desi) cows like hallikar are disappearing as farmers rely on tractors for the cultivation of the land. The number of hallikar cows in the village has fallen from several hundred to under ten, due to lack of food. Cows are worshiped yearly during the Sankranthi festival. Lakshmi and Gowri Dogs play a prominent role in Nadipinayakanahalli. Dog ownership is high because of the belief that dogs are loving, affectionate and protective. They often accompany villagers when gardening and during routine walks. There are rare encounters between humans and snakes. Cobras sometimes enter houses looking for prey such as rats, frogs and hens. Snake bites are often reported but are successfully treated at nearby hospitals. Transportation Every family owns one or more vehicle, such as a bike, tractor or car. There is excellent road infrastructure. In addition to vehicle parking, cows, buffalo and goats are frequently tethered on the road frontage outside a home. Forest Area The village is surrounded by dry forest towards the east. Eucalyptus, tamarind, sandalwood, teak and other trees are grown, as well as bamboo. Forest guards patrol the boundary regularly to prevent villagers from taking trees. Tree poles from eucalyptus are in demand as building material, leading to the possibility of illegal logging. There is a forest reserve where wild animals are abundant. Forestry activities contribute to ground water level depletion. Villagers standing at the mid of mulberry plantation Sports Cricket is popular in the village, with volleyball, and kabbadi also played occasionally. Village sights There are several temples near the village, including temples to Hanuman, Gangamma, and Muneeswarar. Kaivara, the popular hill station is 10 km away via the forest road. There is a cave that was damaged by a landslide but is still visible. The Hanuman temple is also in poor condition. Culture Cultural events are held during Ganesh Chaturthi and Sankranthi. Fairs (‡≤ú‡≤æ‡≤§‡≥ç‡≤∞‡≥Ü) are held every two years. Some villagers travel to religious destinations such as Tirupathi, Dharmasthala and the Nandi Hills. Environmental issues Depletion of ground water is a major challenge, with most bore wells having run dry. Rainfall is extremely low at 20 cm ‚Äì 30 cm annually. A major reason for the water depletion is the absence of micro-irrigation systems and the intensive farming that occurred during the 1980s and 1990s. The state government has initiated the Gundia river/Yettinahole Project to bring new water to the district by diverting the west-flowing Nethravathi river to Chikkaballapura and Kolar, but the project has been delayed due to ecological concerns and protests. Men desperately watching for water while drilling borewell APC RIG drilling for ground water Criticisms The village has a poor reputation for dirty caste politics and factionalism, and fights between villagers are frequent.

In 1317, the city rebelled against the rule of Robert, King of Naples, and locals overpowered the Catalan mercenaries who had taken shelter in the castle.The Lombard Communes: A History of the Republics of North Italy, by William Francis Thomas Butler, page 415.

It is ovoviviparous, the eggs hatching inside the female's body; she then gives birth to 5 to 25 live young per litter. This species is known to live over 30 years. It is an adaptable animal, often finding habitat in urban and suburban areas, including residential areas of Sydney. The lizard is considered beneficial in these areas, with its appetite for garden pests such as slugs and snails. When threatened it may hiss and reveal its blue tongue, startling potential predators. It has strong jaws and can deliver a damaging bite. There are three color-morphs that are part of the Tiliqua scincoides.

In 1994, when the PLA Hong Kong Garrison was being formed in preparation for the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, Liu was named its first commander. In this capacity, he toured Hong Kong's military bases and facilities in July 1996, accompanied by Major General Bryan Dutton, the outgoing commander of the British Forces Overseas Hong Kong. Soon after Hong Kong's handover from Britain to China on 1 July 1997, Liu was promoted to lieutenant general at the end of the month, outranking his British predecessors. He commanded about 15,000 soldiers in the garrison, most of whom were based across the border in mainland China. In September 1997, he became an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In March 1999, Liu became Deputy Commander of the Guangzhou Military Region, which oversaw the Hong Kong Garrison. He was promoted to Commander of the Guangzhou MR in January 2002, and became a full member of the 16th Central Committee in November. He was awarded the rank of full general (shang jiang) in June 2004. In June 2007, Liu was transferred to Beijing to serve as Deputy Chief of the PLA General Staff Department, a position he held until July 2009. He retired from his military career, and was appointed in February 2010 as deputy director of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the 11th National People's Congress.

The Bx23 provides local service in Pelham Bay and Co-op City, while the Q50 provides limited-stop service between Co-op City and subway hubs in Pelham Bay and Flushing. Both routes are city- operated under the MTA Bus Company brand of MTA Regional Bus Operations, and are the only two local routes in the Bronx to operate under the MTA Bus brand. The two routes are the successor to the QBx1 route, privately operated by the Queens Surface Corporation until 2005, and later operated by MTA Bus. This route ran several confusing service patterns between Co-op City and Pelham Bay, with only select runs continuing to Flushing. In September 2010, the QBx1 was split into the Bx23 and Q50 to simplify service in the Bronx, and provide full-time service between Queens and the Bronx. Route description and service =Former QBx1= The original QBx1 service began at the Flushing‚ÄìMain Street subway station in Downtown Flushing, Queens (within a section of Flushing also known as Flushing Chinatown). It ran north on Main Street to Northern Boulevard, then east to Linden Place. It then ran north on Linden Place to the Whitestone Expressway, sharing the street with the and . The QBx1 proceeded north on the Whitestone Expressway service road and then onto the Bronx‚ÄìWhitestone Bridge crossing into the Bronx, and then onto the Hutchinson River Parkway service road to Lafayette Avenue. This portion of the route across the bridge to Bruckner Boulevard was shared with the , the only other local bus between the Bronx and Queens. At the Bruckner Interchange, the QBx1 turned onto Bruckner Boulevard (the Bruckner Expressway service road), traveling east then north to the Pelham Bay Park station. This section is shared with the Bx5. Only selected buses ran between Flushing and Pelham Bay; most QBx1 runs remained in the Bronx.    North of Pelham Bay Park, the QBx1 ran several different services to different parts of Co-op City. The full route circumscribed the entire development, running (clockwise) north along the New England Thruway service road to Bartow Avenue (near the current Bay Plaza Shopping Center), through Section 1, via the Dreiser Loop, through Sections 2 and 3, via the Asch Loop in Section 4, and through Section 5 before returning to Pelham Bay. This pattern operated clockwise (sections 1-2-3-4-5) or counterclockwise (sections 5-4-3-2-1). The full Flushing‚àíCo-op City service either ran clockwise from Flushing or counterclockwise to Flushing. The QBx1 operated a total of ten service patterns, varying on the time of day. During weekday off-peak hours and weekends, the route operated either between Flushing and all five sections of Co-op City, or as a circulatory shuttle service between Pelham Bay and the five sections. During the AM peak a total of five service patterns were used. The three primary AM patterns were Pelham Bay to Bellamy Loop, serving Section 3 via sections 1-2-3; Pelham Bay to Asch Loop, serving Section 4 only; and Pelham Bay running clockwise via Bartow Avenue, serving Sections 4 and 5 before returning to Pelham Bay. The intermittent service to and from Flushing ran via the Bellamy Loop route. The three PM peak hour services were Flushing to Pelham Bay and Bellamy Loop; Pelham Bay to Bellamy Loop; and Pelham Bay running counterclockwise to Sections 5 and 4, Asch Loop, and back to Pelham Bay. While this structure provided direct service to individual sections of Co-op City, the structure was considered confusing and inconvenient due to the many different service patterns under one route designation, and the lack of service between Queens and the Bronx. =Current bus service= Orion V bus on Q50 service near the Main Street station in Downtown Flushing The Bx23 constitutes a simplified version of the former QBx1 route between Pelham Bay Park and Co-op City, running either clockwise (1-2-3-4-5) or counterclockwise (5-4-3-2-1) before returning to Pelham Bay. The Q50, meanwhile, runs between Co-op City and Flushing via Pelham Bay, with its northern terminal at Erskine Place and Earhart Lane in Section 5. Q50 buses travel clockwise in Co-op City northbound, and counterclockwise southbound. The Q50 also employs limited-stop service, making fewer stops in Queens and bypassing the individual loops of Co-op City served by the Bx23. The routes run at all times except late nights; at these times, Co-op City service is replaced by the , while there is no direct Co-op City-to-Queens service. At Pelham Bay Park, both directions of Bx23 and Q50 service share three adjacent bus stops on the southbound Bruckner Boulevard to the south of the subway station. The southernmost stop at the intersection of Bruckner and Amendola Place is used by Flushing-bound Q50 service. The middle stop is used by all clockwise Co-Op City service (Q50s to Section 5 and Bx23s via 1-2-3-4-5). The northernmost stop is used by Bx23s operating the counterclockwise loop. Because of this setup, Bronx-bound Q50 buses must U-turn at Westchester Avenue to stop at Pelham Bay, then U-turn again towards Co-op City. Prior to 2014, the Bx23 employed additional service patterns during rush hours, similar to its predecessor route. Buses would travel via 1-2-3-4 (AM rush) or 4-3-2-1 (PM rush) and return to Pelham Bay, or directly to Section 5 via Bartow Avenue/Bay Plaza/Section 4 (clockwise AM; counterclockwise PM) and return to Pelham Bay. This was eliminated to maintain one consistent service pattern at all times, and allow service between all sections of Co-op City at all times. The Bx23 and Q50 are two of the several local bus routes to serve Co-op City, which is heavily dependent on bus service. They are among five routes (along with the on weekends, , and ) to feed into Pelham Bay Park station from the neighborhood, and the only two to serve all five sections of the development (except for the late night Bx28 service). History The QBx1 was in operation since at least the mid-1960s under the Queens Transit Corporation, labeled the \\"Bx1\\" on Queens bus maps. The route originally operated between Flushing and Pelham Bay Park. By 1968, the QBx1 was extended to Co-op City. The bus company would become Queens- Steinway Transit Corporation in 1986, and Queens Surface Corporation in 1988. On February 27, 2005, the MTA Bus Company took over the operations of the Queens Surface routes as part of the city's takeover of all the remaining privately operated bus routes. In 2009, ten buses from the Eastchester Depot near Co-op City (the former New York Bus Service depot) began to operate on QBx1 service. Two additional stops in the Bronx were added to the route in June 2010, at Baisley Avenue (southbound) and Kearny Avenue (northbound) both at Bruckner Boulevard, to connect with a pedestrian overpass to the Country Club neighborhood. On September 12, 2010, the QBx1 was split into the Q50 Limited and Bx23 routes, simplifying the many service patterns of the former QBx1 route, but eliminating direct service between Pelham Bay and the individual sections of Co-op City. In addition, the changes were made in conjunction with controversial cuts in service to other Co-op City routes during the MTA's 2010 budget crisis, and received negative input from the community. On June 29, 2014, the rush hour service pattern of the Bx23 was eliminated, with the off-peak pattern going into effect at all times. In addition, a stop on the Bx23 was added at Adler Place in the Asch Loop. A stop for the Q50 was also added outside the Dreiser Loop. These changes were the result of a study of bus routes in Co-op City.  Bike racks  Bike racks installed on a Q50 bus in Flushing in 2018. In April 1994, bike racks were installed onto QBx1 buses to carry bicycles over the Whitestone Bridge. This was the first bike-on-bus program in the city. The service was offered on a seasonal basis (April to September), with pick-up/drop-off points at 20th Avenue in Whitestone, Queens and Lafayette Avenue near Ferry Point Park in the Bronx. However, the bike-on-bus program was eliminated on February 27, 2005, the same day as the MTA takeover. In 2017, it was announced that bike racks would be installed on the fronts of Bx23 and Q50 buses by spring 2018. Each rack, mounted on the front of each bus, would be able to carry two bicycles. This was part of the MTA's ongoing pilot program to mount bike racks on several bus routes. In September 2015, the and routes in Staten Island had been the first routes to receive the racks. The expanded program restored bike racks on the Flushing to Co-op City bus corridor for the first time since 2005. On July 1, 2018, bike rack service was inaugurated on the Bx23 and Q50 routes.

It is a small, compact shrub with serrated leave, blue to purple flowers and unusually-shaped sepals. Description Eremophila obliquisepala is a compact, rounded shrub which grows to a height of between . Its leaves are arranged alternately and scattered along the stems, mostly long, wide, lance-shaped to egg-shaped, hairy and have serrated margins. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a hairy stalk usually long. There are 5 overlapping, hairy sepals which are long but which enlarge after flowering. The sepals are green with a purplish tinge and are egg-shaped to heart-shaped but asymmetrical and unequal in size, with the largest sepal emerging from the side of the stalk. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is blue to purple on the outside, white with brown or purple spots inside. The outer surface of the petal tube and its lobes is hairy, the inside of the lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is filled with long, soft hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from June to August and the fruits which follow are woody, oval to almost spherical, long with a hairy, yellow, papery covering. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The specific epithet is from the Latin obliqui-, 'with sides unequal' and sepala, 'sepals', referring to the oblique bases of the anterior sepals. Distribution and habitat Eremophila obliquisepala occurs between Meekatharra and Byro Station in the Gascoyne and Murchison biogeographic regions. It grows on stony plains and sandy flats. Conservation This species is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat. Use in horticulture The evenly-serrated leaves, large blue flowers and large, yellow fruits are attractive features of this small shrub. It can be propagated from cuttings but is often difficult to maintain on its own roots and grafting onto Myoporum rootstock is preferable. It is ideal for growing in a rockery, performing best in full sun in well-drained soil and only requires an occasional watering during a long drought. It has been grown in gardens in drier areas of Victoria but its response to frost is not well-known.

They were signed to Dirty Water Records until 2009; they were also signed to CITYFIDE MUSIC GROUP from 2013 until 2018. They are currently signed with RFlow Rekordz. The band consists of Michael Anthony King - vocals, guitar; Nicholas Brae King - bass, vocals; Jonathan Barnes - drums, percussion. Thirteenth Step have released two studio albums: No More War and Carry On, as well as six studio EPs. Thirteenth Step was put in the national spotlight when they were flown to Arlington Heights, Illinois to perform for alternative rockers Days of the New at Home Bar Chicago in front of a capacity crowd. That event scored them endorsements from Gibson Guitars, Ernie Ball Strings and a national distribution deal with Best Buy. Thirteenth Step tours nationally, having opened up shows for groups including Black Label Society, Suicidal Tendencies, Bad Religion, Black President, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, NOFX, Filter, We Are the Fallen, Living Sacrifice, Demon Hunter, Dead Kennedys, Social Distortion, Danzig, Eagles of Death Metal, Tenacious D, Mike & The Mechanics, and Days of the New. 13th Step early years (2006‚Äì2007) 13th Step was formed by brothers Nicholas and Michael King in the summer of 2006; they wanted to form a rock band. Nicholas started out as the guitarist and keyboardist, and they performed covers of Christian rock bands like Third Day, MercyMe, and Jars of Clay. They recruited guitarist Brent Evans and drummer Jonathan Barnes as official band members, and bassist Angie Thompson at one point drummer. Chad Walls played duo drummer combo with Jonathan, as seen by The Allman Brothers Band in the 1960s and 70s. The band recorded four EPs in 2006. Their debut five-song covers release was More Than Words. They wrote four original acoustic songs for Don't Be Afraid. They wrote and recorded four more songs for the release of Hit The Ground. Their self-titled promotional cover CD, used for booking bars and clubs, was released that fall. The band opened the WLRS Festival in 2006 alongside 7 Day Sun, and SubRosa. They ended the summer of 2007 by opening the Christian rock Ichthus Festival. That same summer Thirteenth Step opened for Tantric and Drowning Pool at Phoenix Hill Tavern. The band was known for the sexual-related artwork of porn star Jada Fire as seen on MySpace. 13th Step (2008‚Äì09) Thirteenth Step released a music video featuring Vietnam War footage in July 2008 with their song \\"My Suicide\\", and an acid-trip-driven music video for \\"Don't Be Afraid\\" the following month for fans on YouTube. The band also released live footage video from concerts and weekly vlogs to update their fans. The band hired Wyndell Williams as a full-time guitarist after Brent Evans was dismissed due to musical differences and drug abuse. The band recorded four albums with Williams but did not break into the mainstream. Break-up (2008‚Äì2014) After remaining inactive for over a year, it was announced in October 2009 that 13th Step had disbanded. Nicholas cited tensions between Michael and the rest of the band. He said that the relationship with Michael had become so strained that the creative juices were no longer flowing. The reality was that Michael was in Beechmont, Louisville battling his addiction to alcohol and drugs. Almost simultaneously with the announcement, Michael opted for a solo career. On July 3, 2013, Cityfide Music Group released 13th Step's What Hits!?, and Michael released his debut solo album when we were young in 2013 with Cityfide Records recording artist LIL Aizy. Meanwhile, Nicholas and Jonathan had reunited with Wyndell Williams to form a new band, called Brothers in Arms with singer Chuck Willis, formerly of Breckinridge and the current frontman of Heaven Hill's latest project. Side projects (2007‚Äì2016) =Altered Addiction original line-up and post-breakup legal battles= Altered Addiction was formed in 2008 in Portland, Louisville by vocalist/guitarist Michael King, keyboardist, guitarist, songwriter and producer Steve Mings, guitarist Matt Crowley, bassist Joe Lewis and drummer Jonathan Barnes. In 2008, Altered Addiction signed with Little Heart Records. With the loss of bassist Joe Lewis, Matt Crowley covered both bass and guitar duties on the debut Sweet Dreams - EP. Steve Mings and Michael King of Altered Addiction formed their own imprint record label in the Portland, Louisville area where they had an in-house recording studio and video production company called Addiction Entertainment L.L.C. Jason Fagan began performing with Michael King and Steve Mings in 2011, under the name \\"Altered Addiction\\", until Matt Crowley's estate issued a legal challenge to the use of the trademarked name for a venture not including Crowley. As a result, they changed their name to \\"Altered Addiction with Jason\\" in January 2012. The group played at the 2012 Portland Festival embarked on their first tour in 2012, and released their debut album, Vendetta (LP), on November 1, 2012. Fagan left the band on December 22, 2012. Altered Addiction second line-up Matt, Steve and Michael regrouped with a new band by the same Altered Addiction in December 2012 with blues guitarist William Mellor (Seth Mellor) to record the covers EP Brown Sugar, released exclusively to ReverbNation. Their original EP Here I Am was released exclusively on PureVolume. Seth left the band the following year and Dujan Burton was hired to record on the covers EP Change The World. He also wrote the songs \\"Jug Band\\" and \\"Hard Headed\\", which are now unreleased singles and out of print. =Post-Steve Mings era, session musicians and arrests= Steve was fired in December 2013 after an argument with the band that resulted in Joe P. Kelly and Dwight Cummins becoming his replacements in the band, thus leaving only Mike and Matt as the founding members of the group. Dujan Burton remained in the band and recorded a new album with the group entitled Glances. His departure came after his legal battles and drug habits got in the way of his performance. He was arrested three times in 2015, on August 11, on September 9, and on October 29. This led to his dismissal from the group. In the following months, Dwight Cummins was arrested for charges of identity theft. Joe P. Kelly was later fired due to musical differences with Mike and Matt. Matt and Mike parted ways for a short time. =Jeffrey Hughes era= While Michael and Colin Price, the bassist for Incarnational Sonship, was attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in South Louisville, he met guitarist and visual artist Jeffrey Hughes, and asked if he would join him and Matt in Altered Addiction. Later Jesse Brennan and his wife Mindy were asked to join the band, and they recorded the album Sinking Ships within a month of joining the band. This didn't last long due in part to the album's failure in the charts. (It was later discovered that Jesse and Mindy had nothing to do with the writing and recording of Sinking Ships. They had, in fact, been kicked out of the band.) =Dave Eged and Patrick Lee Douglas era= Patrick Lee Douglas asked if Matt and Mike would jam at his place. The acoustic covers EP was recorded in his home that night. He added bass lines to the recordings. within a month, Michael Glenn King, Mike's father, suggested bringing Dave Eged into the band to change up the sound and make something fresh with their music. Being friends from back home in Campbellsburg, Kentucky during the original Thirteenth Step days he agreed. He now resides in Cleveland, Ohio but comes to Louisville to record and practice on a regular basis. The band recorded the Up Left Mofo demo tape in Patrick's home studio, and their debut studio EP Fallen at American Recording Company in Louisville. A second EP was recorded during these sessions also that only included Dave, Mike and Matt; it featured covers selected from their favorite rock bands, and was entitled Breeze. \\"Cumbersome\\" was re-recorded twice, once with the band as a four piece, and then as a three-piece. It had been recorded once under the Steve Mings and Dujan Burton era of the band on the Change the World EP, and on a Thirteenth Step release, thus making it the fourth studio version Michael had cut to date. A live acoustic version had been issued by 13th Step during that time as well. \\"Simple Man\\" was recorded twice, in both sessions. =Incarnational Sonship Christian rock spin off to Altered Addiction= Incarnational Sonship was a Christian alternative rock band that formed in 2011 in Hikes Point, Louisville at the Southeast Christian Church. At that time, the band consisted of vocalist Matt Singleton, bassist Michael \\"Mike Higgins\\" King, guitarist Steve Mings, and drummer Jerimy Lindsey. The pastor of the church was throwing a Saturday night concert. A band had backed out and he needed a replacement. Matt, Mike, Steve and Jeremy Mehler formed \\"Pull Me Apart Trenita\\" to perform. Incarnational Sonship current line-up Steve and Michael started a new band after not hearing from the original members of the group. To start the guys toyed around with different band names but settled on the old band name they had with the original group. Colin Price had met Michael while attending Bridgehaven with his wife and asked him if he'd like to start a band; he agreed. Cory Brandon Arledge became the group's guitarist and was later replaced by keyboardist Blaine Grant, a childhood friend of Steve's. Michael has said the reasoning for letting such a great guitarist go was his criminal history. This line-up has remained in place to date. They play shows on a regular basis in coffeeshops and churches around Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio. The band was also known as The Morning Freaks. Upon learning the name was already used by another band, they accepted the fate of Incarnational Sonship and Christian rock being the claim in music. The band issued two singles, \\"Jesus\\" and \\"Single Dreams\\", on Purevolume. =Fallen Down= Fallen Down was an acoustic rock band from St. Matthews, Kentucky, formed in 2011. It consisted of vocalists and multi-instrumentalists Nicholas King and Danny Roach, and a wide array of session musicians. Reunion and touring (2014‚Äì2016) From 2008 onward, Nicholas promised that Thirteenth Step would never reform. However, on April 11, 2014, Thirteenth Step's website announced that the band had reunited for a new tour and planned for a new album. According to Nicholas, \\"We're all very excited to reconnect with our fans and each other after one long Year.\\" He later added that being in Thirteenth Step again was \\"the last thing [he] expected.\\" Jonathan also stated: \\"Our career as Thirteenth Step came to a very abrupt and unforeseen ending. After reflecting on some of the greatest personal and professional moments of our lives, we've come to realize that we are still very capable of continuing that career and our friendship on a grander scale than ever before.\\" In an interview with LEO Weekly magazine, Michael elaborated on the reunion, saying, \\"We never felt like we weren't together. We're not looking at this as a reunion. It's more of a rebirth.\\" Hiatus and family issues (2016‚Äìpresent) The band had announced after its reunion tour that there was not going to be a new album in the works via its Facebook page and that the band would be on a long-awaited hiatus. The hiatus was due in part to bassist Nicholas Brae King having legal issues, and Michael having family issues with their parents' divorce. The tickets for the last few shows were refunded for those who would rather see Thirteenth Step over Mike's new project with former multi-instrumentalist Steve Mings who he had performed within the bands Never October, Altered Addiction and Incarnational Sonship. They simply dubbed their new project Michael Cash and Steve Mings of Altered Addiction. They had vowed to do remakes acoustically live of Thirteenth Step's hit songs \\"My Suicide\\" and \\"Don't Be Afraid\\", and fan favorites like \\"Hit the Ground\\", \\"Heaven's Gates\\", \\"Misery\\", and \\"My Angel\\".. The duo was set to do a regional headline acoustic tour in the fall of 2016. Steve and Michael re-released their entire acoustic demo package online, spanning 10 years of over 50 plus acoustic rock originals and covers, 40 or more newly recorded acoustic rock originals and classic folk rock covers, and the unreleased Altered Addiction demo tapes originally recorded under the band name Altered State. The remastered cassette tapes are now offered as digital downloads via PureVolume for free. The duo had the tapes digitally transferred from modern tape deck to computer technology in Mings's home studio in Portland, Louisville using Mixcraft. A box set was set to be released on July 4, 2016, containing all three unreleased discs plus the Bad Things EP, Drive EP, Here I Am EP, and Change the World EP, containing unreleased studio sessions and live recordings from their debut tour in 2007 and other unreleased tracks from all four studio sessions. =Legal issues= Michael has been arrested for domestic violence with his girlfriend in Bedford, Kentucky three different times and was arrested once for failure to appear in court in Henry County. He has been in and out of group homes growing up and has had many other legal issues related to drugs and car theft. Side projects (2014‚Äìpresent) =Midtown Cocaine= Michael joined guitarist Charlie and Steve after a jam session at the Urban Goatwalker coffee house to form an acoustic post grunge rock trio entitled Midtown Cocaine. They have released over 50 demo tracks via ReverbNation, mostly rough covers and original songs. The group is an acoustic guitar duo of Steve and Charlie, and singer Michael. They have an early Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains and Soundgarden voice meets Bob Dylan and Neil Young guitar work sound. =Red (Nicholas King solo project)= Nicholas began working as a solo artist again as of July 2016 and plays open mics. He holds a day job and tries to get out and play in his free time. He has released a demos EP on PureVolume. =Shorty Doowop (Jonathan Barnes solo project)= Jonathan Barnes has been recording solo work off and on for over 15 years. He has since returned to recording solo music and touring small clubs and bars. He lives in Phoenix, Arizona and plays nightly gigs all over the city. In-print record company Michael King started 13th Step Productions, a production company for underground Louisville area artists that he promotes and manages. He also has started a management company, Michael King Music, Inc. 13th Step Productions has signed Chainfire and most notably Bury The Willing. Michael King Music is the parent company of Burkhart Management L.L.C. The pair produce live recordings and do video production for local area artists, most notably Steve Hunnicutt of Tommyrot. Michael produced Hunnicutt's acoustic live at Wick's Pizza, which was engineered and recorded by Josh Gray of the band Common Collective.

The Fenton Story is a garage rock compilation consisting of songs released by Fenton Records in Grand Rapids, Michigan and the assorted vanity labels that it had pressed and distributed for various regional acts, primarily from western Michigan in the 1960s, and is available on identical LP and CD formats.Note: The AllMusic review depicts the title of the compilation as having two exclamation points, rather than the three shown on the album cover, so a decision has been made to use three in the title the articlekeeping in mind that the quote presented here uses twobut that is intentional not a mistake. The set focuses on basic upbeat and rocking material, but includes a couple of odd and more eclectic expetions. Fenton's founder was musician and entrepreneur Dave Kalmbach, who intended the label to be a place where un-established groups could have a place to record on either the Fenton label itself or on their own vanity labels, which were usually given special custom names chosen by the bands and their management, often under the arrangement that the bands would pay themselves for most of the recording and pressing costs, but receive a certain share in royalties. Commenting on how these recordings more-or-less function as aural snapshots taken from the bygone scrapbook of a more innocent time, Stephen Thomas Earlewine commented: :They preserve a whole gaggle of bands that were bashing out three chords for the love of the music with little hope of hitting the big time. As such, the double-disc/triple-LP set Scream Loud!! The Fenton Story  a collection of these rare, collector-cherished 45s assembled by those very same collectors  almost functions as a piece of regional folk art, capturing bands from Grand Rapids, Holland, Lansing, Muskegon, and elsewhere in western Michigan and thereby offering a specific portrait of a place, or perhaps more specifically a time.* The set begins with the snide \\"I'm Tempted\\", by Grand Rapids' the Quests, who are represented with three other numbers, including the collection's title cut, \\"Scream Loud\\", and the fuzz-driven \\"Shadows in the Night\\" (replete with its Beach Boys style falsetto harmonies) which should already be highly familiar to many garage aficionados, having been previously \\"comped\\" on Hit Records' Trash Box. Tonto and the Renegades from nearby Grand Ledge, are also represented by four songs, including the disc's sophomore track \\"Little Boy Blue\\", their-known song, as well as \\"I Knew This Thing Would Happen\\" and \\"The Easy Way Out\\", which provides the set with a horn-based counterpart to the set's customary \\"clang\\". In likewise fashion, The JuJus's own quartet of songs, is scattered throughout the disc, beginning with the doleful \\"I'm Really Sorry\\", as well as \\"You Treated Me Bad\\", then \\"Do You Understand Me\\" (which includes the incidental sound of crashing broken glass objects in the background), and finally \\"Hey Little Girl\\". The Mussies from South Haven are responsible for the feedback-saturated instrumental \\"12 O'Clock, July\\" and also their rendition of Paul Revere & the Raiders' \\"Louie Go Home\\". The 9th Street Market do a hypnotic \\"You're Gone\\" and the proudly insolent \\"I'm a Baby\\". The Jades (Sparta, Michigan) are featured on several numbers, including \\"We Got Something Going\\" and \\"Please Come Back\\", as well as two topical songs critical of religion and convectional social mores: \\"Surface World\\" and \\"Confined Congregation.\\" \\"Boy is Gone\\", is by Lyn & the Invaders and showcases Linda \\"Lyn\\"Nowicki on the compilation's only female vocal. The set contains two organ-drenched songs from Lansing's the Chancellors, \\"5 Minus 3\\" and \\"Dear John\\". The Assortment are repreented by two songs, \\"First I Look At The Purse\\", and the punky \\"Bless Our Hippy Home\\". The Plagues, from Lansing have several cuts such as \\"I've Been Through It Before\\" and \\"Through This World\\" and the Aardvarks from Muskegon have four including \\"I Don't Need You\\" and the \\"I'm Higher Than I'm Down\\". The set concludes with the Pedestrians' \\"Think Twice\\".

(23 September 1923 ‚Äì 12 February 2008) was an Australian librarian, who was University Librarian at the University of Queensland and University of Sydney and later Director-General of the National Library of Australia.  Early life  Harrison Bryan was born in Brisbane, Queensland, the son of Walter Heywood Bryan and his wife, Myee. He attended Brisbane Grammar School. After enrolling at the University of Queensland in 1941, he joined the Army during WW2, and worked on his B.A via correspondence. He would return to study in 1946 and took Honours in history in 1947. He would later take his M.A. in history in 1954. He married his wife Florence Jolly in 1948. Despite the intention of pursuing a career in journalism or teaching, he was encouraged to consider the new field of library science. After completing the one-year course of the Public Library of New South Wales (now State Library of NSW), the only library science course then available in Australia in 1949, Bryan returned to Brisbane.  Career  The University of Queensland Library, had only had one official librarian appointed to it since its establishment in 1910. Previous staff were either part time, or were doing double duty in some other role within the new University. In 1949, UQ was seeking an Assistant to the Librarian, despite there being no Librarian at all. Bryan took the job, and the position changed to an official University Librarian position a year later. The University of Queensland was undergoing a significant period of transition as it moved from its original location in George St, Brisbane, to its new location at St Lucia. Only a handful of buildings had been constructed by 1950, and the new site had been occupied by the Army during WW2. The collection was small, and most departments maintained their own smaller libraries to support their research needs. Over the next 13 years, Bryan would work steadily to increase the size of the collection, improve funding, and hire new staff. Bryan's father was a Professor in Geology at the University from 1947-1959 and the younger Bryan was well aware of the issues of the poor support of the library, and its ability to support and facilitate research. He had worked as a volunteer library staff member during his undergraduate days. Bryan believed that the library's staff, especially the librarians, needed to have experience in research in order to have the respect of the academics on staff. After taking a Qualifying Certificate in Librarianship from the Library Association of Australia in 1951, he then went on to study his M.A in history. Bryan's report on his study leave to Great Britain in 1957 would be published as a thesis for an Associate's Diploma of the Library Association of Australia in 1960. In 1962, Bryan was invited to become the University Librarian at the University of Sydney. The Fisher Library building was completed in 1963, and its design demonstrated significant changes to modern library design. While Bryan had had no hand in the design of the Fisher Library he would be responsible for the design of the next library building, and be influenced by new ideas emerging from Great Britain. His understanding of the need for a functional building that could adapt to future needs, and which had been designed by an architect sympathetic to libraries, would make Bryan a frequent consultant to other libraries, as they also strove to invent new models. Bryan would give librarianship a higher profile at the University of Sydney over the next 17 years under his leadership. The book collection alone increased from 775,000 to 2.7 million volumes. But this expansion also meant considerable problems in book processing, as many titles acquired through donation or book deposit meant individual cataloguing, because of their specialised nature.  National Library of Australia  In 1980, Bryan became Director-General of the National Library of Australia in Canberra. The Library had been suffering from some decline due to reduced government funding of the book collection and staff cutbacks. Bryan's appointment would resolve some of the morale issues, as he worked to rebuild the reputation of the collection and its strengths. He would work toward rebuilding its leadership in the Asia-Pacific library community. His most significant achievement as Director-General was overseeing the establishment of the Australian Bibliographic Network (ABN) which had been in development for many years, enabling libraries all over Australia to link their collections and make improved interlibrary loan and collection choices. Bryan retired in July 1985.  Memberships and awards  Bryan was twice President of the Library Association of Australia. He was on its General Council for 25 years. He was Chair of the Committee of Australian University Librarians a number of times. Bryan wrote over 300 items of professional literature in library science and history, the most extensive list of any Australian librarian. He was a member of the Board of Examiners for Australian Academic & Research Libraries. This Board set the syllabus and examination papers for those seeking registration as librarians by the Library Association of Australia. For eight years, Bryan would chair this Board and oversee it as it evaluated courses and qualifications offered by the growing number of schools of librarianship in Australia. He served as Editor of the Australian Library Journal from 1954-1957. Bryan's reputation would lead him to be involved with the selection of almost every Australian university librarian from 1964-1979. Through contacts forged in Great Britain during a study tour in 1957, his reputation led to his involvement with UNESCO and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs. Bryan was a member of the UNESCO Australian Advisory Committee on Libraries for almost 10 years. He acted as an advocate for libraries in developing economies. He helped to influence a fund through the Department of Foreign Affairs to provide training for senior librarians from Africa, Asia and the Pacific region, in particular, Indonesia. He received the HCL Anderson Award in 1984. In 1984 he was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia. He would go on to receive honorary doctorates from three universities - Monash, Queensland and Sydney.  Legacy  Bryan died in 2008. He was survived by his wife, four children, six grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

The cell wall (3) swells around the septal pore to form a barrel-shaped ring. Perforations in the parenthesome allow cytoplasm to flow between (4) and (5). Dolipore septa are specialized dividing walls between cells (septa) found in almost all species of fungi in the phylum Basidiomycota. Unlike most fungal septa, they have a barrel-shaped swelling around their central pore, which is about 0.1‚Äì0.2 ¬µm wide. This structure is typically capped at either end by specialized membranes, called \\"parenthesomes\\" (after their parenthesis-like appearance under a microscope) or simply \\"pore caps\\". The rusts (Pucciniales) and smuts (Ustilaginales), although classified in Basidiomycota, have not been observed to have dolipore septa. Dolipore septa vary significantly between monokaryotic and dikaryotic hyphae, which form at different points in basidiomycete life cycles. In monokaryotic but not dikaryotic hyphae, the parenthesomes are continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum, and the septal walls are constructed from different material than the cell walls. All dolipore septa can allow cytoplasm, and sometimes mitochondria, to flow through their pores; those in monokaryotic hyphae have perforated parenthesomes, which allow cell nuclei to flow through as well.

History The site of the promenade was formerly occupied by the Kwun Tong Public Cargo Working Area, which was home to many waste paper recycling businesses. The cargo area was reduced in size in 2009 to make way for the first phase of the promenade, a 200-metre long section near the ferry piers. This section opened to the public in January 2010. The existing Hoi Bun Road Sitting-out Area, south of the Kwun Tong Promenade, was built by the Urban Council in 1982. After the new promenade opened in 2010, this existing sitting-out area was reconstructed to adopt the same architectural style. In addition, a dry weather flow interceptor (DWFI) belonging to the Drainage Services Department was demolished and moved underground. This was completed in December 2013. The DWFI would have otherwise served as a barrier between the Kwun Tong Promenade and the Hoi Bun Road Sitting-out Area. The reconstruction of the sitting-out area was completed in 2014, effectively extending the promenade about 80 metres southward. The waste paper recyclers in Kwun Tong protested the closure of the public cargo working area. The government responded that there was adequate space at other cargo areas in Tuen Mun, Rambler Channel, and Chai Wan and encouraged them to relocate. The public cargo working area was fully decommissioned in December 2011. The promenade was subsequently extended by 750 metres to the north, to a total length of about one kilometre.

In the early 1950s, Carmi abandoned the informal style and adopted a geometric rigor in his works. His works often used factory materials such as welded steel and iron. Between 1958 and 1965 Carmi collaborated with the steel company Italsider (later Ilva) as their responsible for the image.

The group, which claimed a membership of 500 prostitutes, was not registered with the Federal Elections Commission as a political action committee and did not, therefore, directly provide political donations. Its members, instead, evangelized support of Clinton to their clients and, in some instances, reportedly offered enhanced sexual services to existing customers in exchange for direct donations to Clinton's presidential campaign. The organization centered its support of Clinton on her health care policy proposals and foreign policy experience. According to a 2015 press release from the group, the perceived benefits of a Clinton foreign policy would include avoiding \\"a repeat of the Secret Service's Colombian prostitution scandal by making sure that her detail 'buys American'\\". Some of its members had been previously affiliated with Pimpin' for Paul, an organization of Nevada-based prostitutes that campaigned for Ron Paul in the 2008 United States presidential election and 2012 United States presidential election. Members of the group were largely drawn from brothels owned by Nevada prostitution mogul and Libertarian Party member Dennis Hof, and the organization has been described as his \\"brainchild\\". Hof said that one of his motivations was that he wanted his workers to get involved in politics, with some of them starting Hookers for Hillary and others forming the rival organisation Tarts for Trump. While stopping short of calling Hookers for Hillary a publicity stunt, Hof indicated that the group's existence helped build awareness for his businesses. Nonetheless, despite characterizations of the group as a public relations ploy designed to drive media coverage of Hof's brothels, a reporter for The Guardian who interviewed Hookers for Hillary members described their support for Clinton as genuine.

It claims itself as a sect of Buddhism. According to the official website of Rulaizong, in 2015, the organization had more than 90,000 followers. History Miaochan, whose birth name was Liu Jinlong, was a stuntman during his youth. He learned qigong during that time and could sit on a bed of nails. Liu married three times and had three children. Peng, his third wife, had the Buddhist name \\"Miaodianlian\\" (miao means wonderful, dian means palace, lian means lotus). In 1990, Liu and his wife practiced through Master Wujue Miaotian. Miaotian gave Liu a Buddhist name, \\"Miaodianming\\" (ming means understanding). Liu was involved in a series of lawsuits with Miaotian in the late 1990s. In 1998, Liu accused Miaotian of bilking consumers in the sale of cubicles for cremation urns. In March 1998, Liu gave himself a Buddhist name, \\"Xingbenjue\\" (xing means actions, ben means roots, jue means enlightenment), declared himself a Buddha, and called a press conference to criticize Miaotian. In August of the same year, Liu apologized to Miaotian and was allowed to rejoin Miaotian. In 2004, Liu declared himself a Buddha again and changed his name to Liu Miaoru. Liu claimed he was \\"Master Miaochan\\" (which literally means \\"the wonderful Zen\\") and established Rulaizong. It was rumored that the reason behind the breakaway from Miaotian was due to the dissatisfaction of Liu towards Miaotian on the selling of his products towards believers. According to the official saying from Rulaizong, Liu became the \\"Master with Great Achievement\\" and established Rulaizong in 1998, and officially started to spread his teachings in 2004. Doctrines According to the official website of Rulaizong, the belief system uses the works Three Holy Teachings, Compassionate Teachings from Miaochan, Dharma's Speeches towards Heredity, Heart Sutra, and Diamond Sutra as the \\"most exacted rules of Dzogchen\\". Of these books, Three Holy Teachings was authored by Miaochan himself. The book states that besides TathƒÅgata, all things (including things from ten spiritual realms) are empty and are created by TathƒÅgata. Rulaizong believes that Miaochan had a great force to remove believers' bad karmas. Rulaizong also states that Miaochan was sent to the SahƒÅ World by TathƒÅgata, and believers would accept Miaochan when they were enlightened. Miaochan stated that although there were not many people believing him, their eyes from the sky had seen the spirituality of the three wise men and the three lower realms. Nonetheless, if they did not follow the \\"Rules of TathƒÅgata\\" proposed by Rulaizong, they would not see TathƒÅgata. Miaochan also stated that if a bodhisattva's reincarnation did not follow Miaochan's practice, he would only retrieve his identity as a bodhisattva or even lower his status. Activities thumbleft Believers in each special municipality and county in Taiwan Rulaizong has 30 monasteries in the northern, middle, and southern parts of Taiwan. Moreover, 101 university clubs related to Rulaizong were established in Taiwan. For example, in the National Taiwan University, the \\"Buddhism Witness Club\\", which had the background of Rulaizong, organized band practices, exchanges, and pujas. In 2015, the \\"Buddhism Witness Club\\" at the National Taiwan Ocean University was awarded the \\"Excellent Award in Academic and Art Clubs\\" by Evaluation of Nationwide University Clubs of Taiwan. These clubs also cooperated with Taiwanese police to organize anti-crime promotion activities. According to its official website, Rulaizong has 90,000 believers, most of them intelligentsia and their families. More than 8,000 university students are believers of Rulaizong. Some Taiwanese artists, such as Sonia Sui, Yao Yao, Annie Yi, Harlem Yu, Joanne Tseng, and Chiang Shu-na are also believers of Rulaizong. Matthew Lien, a Taiwan-based Canadian artist, composed a song called \\"All Rise Together\\" for Rulaizong. When Chiang Shu-na participated in an activity organized by Rulaizong, she was blessed by Miaochan. At that time, her body shook for 20 seconds, making discussions in the Internet society of Taiwan. A person who is willing to become a believer of Rulaizong must be introduced by a believer in order to enter Rulaizong. A handbook is published for senior believers to answer newcomers' doubts. According to Rulaizong's confidential documents, Rulaizong does not accept critically ill patients and children as believers. Controversies According to the Shakyamuni Buddhist Foundation founded by Miaotian, Miaochan cheated his master, destroyed his reputation, and apprenticed privately. Hence, the Foundation gave a verbal warning to Miaochan in 2012. After the incident of Chiang Shu-na in 2014, the Foundation found that Miaochan also used sorcery to cheat people, misled people, and made trouble among believers. Consequently, the Foundation decided to expel Miaochan from Zen. The Foundation also described the behavior of believers of Rulaizong, saying that using the phrase \\"Thank the Master, Praise the Master,\\" which is repeated by believers during gatherings to praise Miaochan is like parroting. The Foundation also stated that the activities of Rulaizong were a kind of idolatry, violating the concept that all sattvic beings are equal in Buddhism. Besides its doctrines, Rulaizong has been criticized for attracting believers in a direct marketing fashion. Believers of Rulaizong must pay 300 New Taiwan dollars for admission, while students and other believers pay 200 New Taiwan dollars and 2000 New Taiwan dollars for the extra fee each month, respectively. Although the official position is that the extra fee is voluntary, it has led to controversy. Moreover, a bank issued a credit card that frequently deducted an amount of cash to cover the extra fee, and deducted 1% from each transaction to the \\"Buddhism Witness Association\\". According to an estimation by the Apple Daily, Rulaizong earned the accumulated revenue of a few billion New Taiwan dollars in 2014. University clubs related to Rulaizong were also involved in controversies. Some students accused these clubs of forcibly receiving revenue and occupying classrooms for promotions. Some students from the National Taiwan Normal University said that they had to pay an extra fee of 200 New Taiwan dollars after they attended activities related to Rulaizong. Although the president of the club declined the accusation of the extra fee, according to the regulations of university clubs in Taiwan, these clubs were responsible to report other revenues besides the club fees. The club at the National Taiwan Normal University did not report the extra fees to the university, leading the university to launch an investigation. After the clip about Chiang Shu-na shaking for 20 seconds during an activity organized by Rulaizong was revealed, the Shakyamuni Buddhist Foundation criticized the behavior as the result of a strange power that made believers act crazy. A psychologist said that Chiang's behavior was something like expressing emotions or hysteria. A religious expert said that it was irrelevant to induction. An expert of qigong said that it was a way of hypnosis using qigong.

Biography Telegraph Less (1943) (Art.IWM PST 4041) Nachshen was born in the city of Zhitomir, which was then part of Russia and is now in the Ukraine. Nachshen was born into a Jewish family and after an anti-Jewish pogrom in the city in 1905, the family fled Zhitomir and eventually settled in London. Nachshen did well at school in London and enrolled in the Slade School of Art. By the 1920s she had established herself as a successful book designer. She illustrated translations of works by Arthur Schnitzler and the Nobel Prize winner Anatole France in a style based on Russian folk art and art deco elements. Nachshen also illustrated a version of the Jewish text the Haggadah in 1934 and also illustrated editions of works by Oscar Wilde and Samuel Butler. She also produced illustrations for the Radio Times. During World War Two, Nachshen produced poster designs for a number of high-profile campaigns, notably the Make Do and Mend campaign run by the Board of Trade and also Telegraph Less for the General Post Office. She continued with her book illustration work during the War, producing designs for versions of Diary of a Madman by Nikolai Gogol and a 1945 collection of short stories by Feodor Dostoyevsky as well as books by Enid Blyton. After the War, Nachshen lived in London and continued to illustrate Russian novels and poetry, mainly for the publishers Constable & Co and also for the Lindsay Drummond company. For the Russian novels, Nachshen used scraperboard to create dramatic illustrations that resembled a style of eastern European woodcuts, while for the children's book that she illustrated she used much lighter pen drawings. Books illustrated Books illustrated by Nachshen include, * The Works of Anatole France by Anatole France, (Bodley Head, 1925) * Topsy Turvey by V.

It appears in the Libro de los juegos of 1283. Rules The following rules are from the reconstruction given on the website of Jean- Louis Cazaux, based on work by him and Sonja Musser. The game is played on a 12√ó12 board. *The king and rook move as they do in modern chess. Their Betza notations are thus K and R respectively. *The aanca (a beautiful and fearsome bird, very similar to a roc, sometimes translated incorrectly as gryphon) moves one square diagonally (like a ferz), before optionally continuing orthogonally outward any number of squares. Its Betza notation is t[FR]. *The rhinoceros moves like a modern knight, before continuing diagonally outward any number of squares. (In H. J. R. Murray's translation, its first move is a non-capturing knight move, after which it acts as a bishop for the rest of the game.) Its Betza notation is t[NB]. *The lion moves like a threeleaper or a camel, and can jump (a combined (3,0)-leaper and (3,1)-leaper). (In Murray's translation, it can only move as a threeleaper.) Its Betza notation is HL. *The giraffe moves like a zebra, a (3,2)-leaper. (In Murray's translation, it is a (4,1)-leaper.) Its Betza notation is J. *The crocodile moves like the modern bishop. Its Betza notation is B. *The pawn moves like the modern pawn, but cannot make an initial double step or capture en passant. Its Betza notation is mfWcfF. When it reaches the other end of the board (the twelfth rank for White, or the first rank for Black), it promotes to the piece that was originally there: the exception is that a pawn promoting on the g-file becomes an aanca. For example, a pawn promoting on the a-file would become a rook. Castling does not exist in Grant Acedrex. On its first move, however, a king may make a diagonal or orthogonal leap of two squares (Betza notation AD) in addition to its normal moves. =Using dice= The game could be sped up by using eight-sided dice to dictate which piece could move that turn, ranking them in the order: king (8), aanca (7), rhinoceros (6), rook (5), lion (4), crocodile (3), giraffe (2), and pawn (1). Computer players The multi- variant Chess engines Fairy-Max and Postduif can play Grant Acedrex under the XBoard or WinBoard user interface.

The frauds where victims part with their money by promising cash, prizes, and services and high returns on investment are part of mass market fraud. Characteristics and classification Such scams or consumer frauds generally fall into four categories: # Pretending to sell something you do not have, and taking the money # Supplying goods or services which are of lower quality than those paid for, or failing to supply the goods and services sought # Persuading customers to buy something they do not really want through oppressive marketing techniques # Disguising ones identity in order to perpetrate a fraud Alternatively, mass market fraud may also be classified as follows: #On basis of communication mechanism: 'Internet fraud', 'mail fraud' and 'tele-marketing fraud' #On basis of Scheme central to fraud: 'lottery fraud', 'insurance fraud', 'loan fraud', 'mobile tower fraud', 'quiz fraud' Victim reporting reveals that Internet-based solicitations are among the most common: in the United States, web sites and e-mails accounted for 60 percent of reported contacts in 2009, and Canada noted a 46 percent spike in Internet- related complaints from 2008 to 2009. As per United States Department of Justice the mass-marketing fraud schemes generally fall into three main categories: (i) advance-fee fraud schemes; (ii) bank and financial account schemes; and (iii) investment opportunities. Advance fee fraud schemes are most popular. This type of scheme is based on the concept that a victim will be promised a substantial benefit ‚Äì such as a million-dollar prize, lottery winnings, a substantial inheritance, or some other item of value ‚Äì but must pay in advance some purported fee or series of fees before the victim can receive that benefit. The mobile phones, internet and electronic media have given following distinct advantages to the mass market fraudsters: *Low setup cost and mass scale reach *Fraud at a distance *Ease in financial transaction Nature Mass marketing fraud schemes are predominantly transnational/interstate in nature. Perpetrators operate from multiple foreign countries and utilize the financial infrastructure of one or more countries to transfer and launder funds. Law enforcement investigations have exposed that such schemes operating not only in multiple countries in North America, Europe, and Africa, but in other countries and jurisdictions as diverse as Brazil, Costa Rica, Hong Kong, India, Israel, the Philippines, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. Many of the frauds perpetrated online, work on the principle of large number of victims losing relatively small sums of money. The Office for Fair Trading (2006) research illustrates that in many of the frauds relatively small sums of money are lost ‚Äì frequently less than ¬£100. The tactic of the fraudster is to secure such a sum of money that the victim will be less bothered to report the fraud. Mass-marketing fraud ‚Äì whether committed via the Internet, telemarketing \\"boiler rooms,\\" the mail, television or radio advertising, mass meetings, or even one-on-one talks over people's kitchen tables, has two elements in common. First, the criminals who conduct any mass-marketing fraud scheme aim to defraud multiple individuals or businesses to maximize their criminal revenues. Second, the schemes invariably depend on persuading victims to transfer money or funds to the criminals based on promises of valuable goods, services, or benefits, and then never delivering the promised goods, services, or benefits to the victims. The reporting of mass marketing fraud is quite low, as per OFT there is only 1 to 3% reporting. Common examples Common mass marketing scams in Australia, Canada, US, UK and other western countries include foreign lotteries and sweepstakes, traditional West African fraud schemes and 419 letter scams, charity scams, romance scams, boiler room or share sale fraud, credit card interest reduction schemes, auction and retail website schemes, investment schemes, counterfeit check fraud schemes (including schemes targeting attorneys), emergency assistance schemes, merchandise purchase/product misrepresentation schemes, psychic/clairvoyant schemes, bank and financial account schemes, recovery schemes, sale of merchandise/overpayment schemes, and service schemes. Bank and financial account schemes not only involve fraud but also identity theft through phishing and vishing. In developing countries including India the lottery scam through e-mails, SMSs and other unsolicited messages, 'Nigerian letter fraud', phishing and pyramid scams are popular. Recently, the Mass Fraud Quiz Competition, normally known as \\"Chehra pechano\\" (identify the Face of Actor/Actress), is being run by fraudsters using communication mechanisms such as print media (daily newspaper), television and through online websites. The fraudsters run a quiz campaign in classified/business columns in daily newspapers, also airing on live TV programs on popular Indian channels such as Sony TV, Sahara One, B4U, Mahua, Houseful, Cinema TV and Maha Movie Channel etc., and through online websites. At present, there is no authoritative statistical data available on financial loss due to mass market frauds. However, in 2006, the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading (OFT) study estimated that each year 3.2 million United Kingdom adults (6.5 percent of the adult population) fall victim to mass-marketing schemes, collectively losing ¬£3.5 billion. Similarly, a June 2008 study by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) found 453,100 of those victims (56.2 percent) reportedly lost AU $977 million (US$905.7 million as of June 27, 2008) in selected schemes such as lottery, pyramid, and phishing schemes. In India there is no single agency to estimate the loss due to such mass market fraud. As per IMMFWG, there are strong indications that the order of magnitude of global mass-marketing fraud losses is in the tens of billions of dollars per year.  Initiatives to combat fraud  MMF frauds are committed by fraudsters and the illicit proceeds are received by their counterparts in countries on every continent in the world. Methods of MMF and its money laundering components are similar to drug trafficking. A project led by Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), examined global money flows relating to mass marketing fraud schemes. One of major step to combat the mass marketing Fraud is the formation of International Mass-Marketing Fraud Working Group (IMMFWG) in September 2007. It consists of law enforcement, regulatory, and consumer protection agencies from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Netherlands, Nigeria, UK, US and Europol. US and Canada had made changes in substantive and procedural laws. Canada made changes in Competition Act (Bill C-20); the Extradition Act and Canada Evidence Act (Bill C-40); and Omnibus Criminal Code Amendments (Bill C-51), as well as legislation related to Proceeds of Crime, and Wiretapping which includes impact on telemarketing cases. US provided significant enhancement to fraud related criminal offenses in the Senior Citizens Against Marketing Scams Act of 1994 and the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act of 2000. One significant piece of legislation affecting mass-marketing fraud that was enacted since 2003 is the U.S. SAFEWEB Act. Competition Bureau Canada partnered with Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and Royal Canadian Mounted Police and upgraded earlier telemarketing fraud call centre PhoneBuster to a Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC), which is now a central agency in Canada that collects information and criminal intelligence on such matters as mass marketing fraud (i.e.: telemarketing), advance fee fraud (i.e.: West African letters), Internet fraud and identification theft complaints. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Canada has also started a Reporting Economic Crime On-Line (RECOL) initiative. Canada has created a system known as CANSHARE, a web-based database connecting consumer affairs departments across. US has had a 'Consumer Sentinel' complaint database maintained by FTC since 1997. Consumer Sentinel collects information about all types of consumer fraud and identity theft from the FTC and over 125 other organizations and makes those data available to law enforcement partners around the world for use in their investigations. In United States, the FBI and a nonprofit private-sector entity, the National White Collar Crime Center has started an 'Internet Crime Complaint Center' (IC3) for online reporting of complaints about Internet-related crime like Internet fraud and lottery/sweepstakes scams. Canadian and American law enforcement authorities have shown great creativity in developing and participating in a wide range of public education and prevention measures that involve cross-border fraud. For example, in Canada, the \\"Stop Phone Fraud ‚Äì It's a Trap' marketing campaign, as described above, provided public- and private-sector entities with a variety of educational materials and resources. In the United States, the National Consumers League, with a grant from the United States Department of Justice, developed a \\"Telemarketing Fraud Education Kit\\" for distribution to government agencies, nonprofit consumer, civic, community, and labor organizations, and schools. ScamWatch is a central portal of Government of Australia administered by Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, for issuing news and alert on fraud and scams and online reporting of the frauds and scams. Stay Smart Online is the Australian Government's online safety and security website, designed to help everyone understand the risks and simple steps we can take to protect our personal and financial information online. The Little Book of Scams has been published by Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The book is available free of cost. The little black book of scams highlights a variety of popular scams that regularly target Australian consumers and small business in areas such as fake lotteries, internet shopping, mobile phones, online banking, employment, investment opportunities. The Office of Fair Trading in, which is closed now, was earlier responsible for all Mass Marketing Frauds in . OFT had provided the advice and support to the fraud victim through letter or email, leaflets, DVD, website with advice and prevention advice to chronic victims. OFT published the 'Research on impact of mass marketed scams' in December 2006, document on support for victims of fraud and fraud typologies and victims of fraud. The government has a separate act known as the 'Fraud Act' to cover frauds mainly committed by false representation, failing to disclose information and abuse of position. The Action Fraud is the 's National fraud and internet crime reporting centre. Action fraud covers all type of A-Z frauds including Mass Marketing Frauds. Action Fraud has partnered with charity 'Victim Support' to help the victims. The Government of New Zealand has also a scamwatch portal on their Consumer Protection Website. The portal is being maintained by Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. The aim of Scamwatch is to provide you with information you need to protect yourself from scams, so you can recognize a set-up and avoid the hook and the inevitable sting of a scam. Consumer Protection has teamed up with its trusted partner Netsafe to allow victim report through the ORB. Consumer Affairs does not have investigative or enforcement powers. Fraud Victim Report is sent to Consumer Protection who may publish information about it on the Alerts section of their Scamwatch website. ORB is working with partner agencies to direct victim reports through to the organization best able to investigate or advice on various types of online incidents that include scams and frauds, spam messages, objectionable material, privacy breaches and problems whilst shopping online.

He laid out part of the North Island Main Trunk railway through the King Country. Early life Hursthouse was born in 1841 in Norwich, England. His parents were John Hursthouse (1811‚Äì1860) and Helen, n√©e Wilson (1803‚Äì1895). His parents and other family members (his father's brother, Charles Hursthouse, and a cousin, Thomas Newsham, and their families) came to New Zealand on the Thomas Sparks; they arrived in Wellington on 31 January 1843. John Hursthouse and family proceeded to New Plymouth, where Charles Hursthouse received his education. Professional life and militia In 1855, Hursthouse joined the survey department as a cadet, being promoted to assistant surveyor in 1857. He was sent to undertake the Waitara survey after land there got confiscated, but the situation escalated into the First Taranaki War. Hursthouse participated in the First and Second Taranaki War until 1864, and was present at the Battle of Waireka and at Mahoetahi. In 1866, he was made an ensign of the Military Settlers; in 1869, he was promoted to lieutenant of the Taranaki militia; and in 1881, he was promoted to captain of the New Zealand militia. He retired from the militia in 1905. Political career Hursthouse represented the Grey and Bell electorate on the fourth and fifth Taranaki Provincial Council from 25 September 1868 to 10 February 1870. Life after the Taranaki Wars In 1871, Hursthouse was appointed by Taranaki Province as a surveyor in their public works department. In 1875, he was promoted to resident engineer, based in New Plymouth. In 1880, he was surveying roads to Parihaka and in November 1880, he was present at the invasion of Parihaka. In late 1882 and early 1883, he accompanied the Minister of Native Affairs, John Bryce, to Kawhia and the King Country, and was present at Mangaorongo when Te Kooti was pardoned. In March 1883, Hursthouse and his cousin, Thomas Newsham, were imprisoned by Te Mahuki of the NgƒÅti Maniapoto tribe. After 41 hours of ill-treatment, their rescue was facilitated by Wetere Te Rerenga. From the end of 1884, Hursthouse worked on the survey for the North Island Main Trunk railway between Te Awamutu and Otorohanga through the King Country, and later to Mokau (since renamed to Puketutu). Hursthouse supervised the construction of the tunnel near Poro-o-Tarao. In 1891, Hursthouse transferred to the Lands and Survey department, and he was in charge of road construction in the King Country. The Rotorua road district was later came under his responsibility, too. In 1899, he was transferred to Wellington. In 1901, a separate department for road works was established, and Hursthouse was appointed its chief engineer. He retired from public service on 30 March 1909. Family and death His mother, Helen Hursthouse (n√©e Wilson), was the aunt of a number of Richmond siblings: Henry Robert Richmond, William Richmond, Jane Maria Atkinson, and James Crowe Richmond. Richmond Hursthouse, born in 1845, was his younger brother. Charles Wilson Hursthouse married Ellen Humphries. She was the daughter of Dr. Edward Larwill Humphries, who was a surgeon and speaker of the Taranaki Provincial Council for four years. They had at least seven children. Hursthouse had a daughter with Mere Te Rongopamamao Aubrey; Rangimarie Hetet was born in 1892. Hetet's biography states that both her parents had previous relationships. Hetet's daughter was Diggeress Te Kanawa, with her first name honouring her father, who was a digger with the New Zealand (MƒÅori) Pioneer Battalion in World War I. Hursthouse's daughter and granddaughter were both regarded as master weavers, and his daughter was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. After a long illness, he died on 25 February 1911 at his residence in Lower Hutt. He was survived by his wife, three daughters, and four sons. He is buried at Taita Cemetery in Lower Hutt. Ellen Hursthouse died in 1925 and is buried next to him.

Along with large-scale Scrum (LeSS), disciplined agile delivery (DAD), and Nexus, SAFe is one of a growing number of frameworks that seek to address the problems encountered when scaling beyond a single team. SAFe is made freely available by Scaled Agile, Inc., which retains the copyrights and registered trademarks. SAFe promotes alignment, collaboration, and delivery across large numbers of agile teams. It was developed by and for practitioners, by leveraging three primary bodies of knowledge: agile software development, lean product development, and systems thinking. The primary reference for the scaled agile framework was originally the development of a big picture view of how work flowed from product management (or other stakeholders), through governance, program, and development teams, out to customers. With the collaboration of others in the agile community, this was progressively refined and then first formally described in a 2007 book. The framework continues to be developed and shared publicly; with an academy and an accreditation scheme supporting those who seek to implement, support, or train others in the adoption of SAFe. Starting at its first release in 2011 already five major versions have been released while the latest edition, version 5.0, was released in January 2020. While SAFe continues to be recognised as the most common approach to scaling agile practices (at 30 percent and growing),, it also has received criticism for being too hierarchical and inflexible.  Challenges of scaling agile principles and practices  = Coping with longer planning horizons = Development teams typically refine their backlog up to two to three iterations ahead, but in larger organizations the product marketing team needs to plan further ahead for their commitments to market and discussions with customers. They will often work with a very high level, 12 to 18-month roadmap, then plan collaboratively with the teams for three months of work. The development teams will still get into detailed refinement 2-3 iterations ahead, only getting into detailed task plans for the next iteration. = Keeping agile at abstract levels of responsibility = While development teams have a number of frameworks that define how they should be agile, there is very little that describes this for management. SAFe delivers many of the same principles, such as cross-functional teams, to the groups that handle the more abstract levels of responsibility and planning (product and portfolio). SAFe has also been criticized for aggregating too many disparate practices. = Dealing with delegated authority = In Scrum, the product owner is expected to assume responsibility for the full product life- cycle, including the return on investment of development decisions, as well as performance in market. On large-scale developments, the organization wants a view across multiple team backlogs, such as provided by a product manager. Although SAFe assumes the product owner role sits with product management, it has nonetheless been criticized for separating product owners into the development organization. = Synchronizing deliverables = Agile frameworks are designed to enable the development team to be autonomous and free to design how they work. SAFe acknowledges that, at the scale of many tens or hundreds of development teams, it becomes increasingly chaotic for teams to fully self-organize. It therefore puts some constraints on this, so that where teams are working on the same product, their deliverables can be better synchronized for releasing together, although this has been one area in which SAFe has been criticized. = Allowing time for innovation and planning = The SAFe planning cycle recommends including an additional iteration after a release, so that teams can improve their practices and are ready for the next planning increment. Earlier editions of SAFe also designed this to be a hardening iteration, that is to stabilize or harden the product before releasing it. This was predicated on the complications of working with large integration environments where dependencies meant that you could not test everything until the very end. SAFe was criticized for this as it represented an anti-agile or waterfall element, but was in line with lean 90-day increments which make 13 weeks, and if doing two-week sprints you need six of them plus a one-week planning or hardening cycle. This is not included in recent editions of SAFe. Implementation = Underlying principles of SAFe = According to its authors, SAFe is based upon ten underlying concepts, which are derived from existing lean and agile principles, as well as observation: # Take an economic view # Apply systems thinking # Assume variability; preserve options # Build incrementally with fast integrated learning cycles # Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems # Visualize and limit work-in-progress, reduce batch sizes, and manage queue lengths # Apply cadence (timing), synchronize with cross-domain planning # Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers #Decentralize decision- making # Organize around value = The SAFe framework = In SAFe version 5.0, there are four configurations: essential, portfolio, large solution and full: * Essential SAFe is the most basic configuration. It describes the most critical elements needed and is intended to provide the majority of the framework's benefits. It includes the team and program level (which it calls agile release trains or ARTs). * Large Solution SAFe allows for coordination and synchronization across multiple programs, but without the portfolio considerations. In earlier versions of SAFe, this level was referred to as value stream. * Portfolio SAFe includes concerns for strategic direction, investment funding, and lean governance. * Full SAFe combines the other three levels. = Certifications = Scaled Agile provides certifications that cover different areas and knowledge levels.

It runs through southern Hesse through the Hessian Ried (Hessische Ried) and so it is also called the Riedbahn (Ried Railway). The section between Darmstadt and Riedstadt-Goddelau is now largely closed. The section between Riedstadt-Goddelau and Biblis, which is now considered part of the Mannheim‚ÄìFrankfurt railway, is of great importance for long-distance passenger services and rail freight traffic. The last section from Biblis to Worms is used by regional passenger services and rail freight traffic.  History  The Darmstadt‚ÄìWorms railway was originally built by the Hessian Ludwig Railway (Hessische Ludwigsbahn), to connect Darmstadt, the capital of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, with Worms, the second most important city in the province of Rheinhessen of the Grand Duchy. The riparian communities contributed significantly to the financing of the project. On 29 May 1869, the line from Darmstadt via Riedstadt-Goddelau and Biblis to Rosengarten station, on the opposite side of the Rhine from Worms, was opened by the Prime Minister of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, Reinhard Carl Friedrich von Dalwigk. From Rosengarten station, trains crossed the Rhine from 1870 to 1900 using the Worms- Rosengarten train ferry, as there was no bridge across the Rhine at Worms. In December 1900, a railway bridge was opened over the Rhine to Worms, creating a direct connection to Worms and replacing the existing terminus at Rosengarten and the ferry crossing over the Rhine. In 1975, the railway between Darmstadt and Goddelau was closed due to lack of traffic and partly dismantled. All that remains of the line is a siding from Darmstadt to Weiterstadt-Riedbahn, where the line ends.  Operations  = Darmstadt‚ÄìRiedstadt-Goddelau= A siding to the industrial area of Weiterstadt-Riedbahn still exists on the largely disused section between Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof and Riedstadt-Goddelau and it is occasionally used by freight traffic. = Riedstadt-Goddelau‚ÄìBiblis = Almost all Intercity-Express and InterCity trains between the Frankfurt railway node in the north (the stations of Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof, Frankfurt South station and Frankfurt Airport) and Mannheim Hauptbahnhof in the south run on the middle section between Riedstadt-Goddelau and Biblis. In addition, the RE 70, a Regional-Express service, runs from Frankfurt via Gro√ü Gerau-Dornberg, Riedstadt-Goddelau, Biblis and Lampertheim to Mannheim. = Biblis‚ÄìWorms = The southern section is operated only by two Regionalbahn services: RB 62 from Biblis to Worms Hbf and RB 63 on the route from Hofheim (Ried) to Worms Hbf (originating in B√ºrstadt and Bensheim, see also Nibelung Railway).

Shak's origins in Mainland China, inherited wealth, connections to the Catholic Church and passion for contemporary education allowed her to become highly influential in Chinese educational reform and UK-China relations.  Childhood  Born in Southeast China on the 18th of March 1932, at birth Shak's name was originally Lee Ho-Yee. She was baptised in 1942 when she was ten years old and thereafter had her name changed. Therese was baptised by Rev. Edmund Sullivan at St. Therese's Church, Kowloon, Hong Kong. The surname ‚ÄòShak‚Äô was acquired through her stepfather Shak Chung-Shan (traditional: Áü≥ÈêòÂ±±) (Christian name: Joseph Stephen Shak). The fate of Therese's biological father Lee Shui-Chuen (Chinese: ÊùéÂ∞èÊ≥â) is unknown. Therese's mother, Shak Wong Fung-Lin (traditional: Áü≥ÈªÉÈ≥≥ËìÆ), married Shak Chung- Shan before moving with Therese and her sister and brother, to Hong Kong. It is implied Fung-Lin and Chung-Shan had two daughters, one of whom, Catharine Shak, had learning difficulties.  Family  Born in 1901 Therese Shak's stepfather Shak Chung-Shan overcame humble beginnings to become a successful businessman. At the age of nine he and six other siblings were orphaned. In 1920, at 19 years of age Chung-Shan was the Principal of Sacred Heart Canossian College (traditional: ËÅñÂøÉÊõ∏Èô¢). Shak Chung-Shan was the founder of two film companies Naam Wa Motion Picture Company (traditional: ÂçóËèØÂΩ±ÁâáÂÖ¨Âè∏), which produced movies from 1935 to 1940 and Wa Ngai Motion Picture Company (traditional: ËèØËóùÈü≥È†ªÂÖ¨Âè∏; simplified: ÂçéËâ∫ÂΩ±ÁâáÂÖ¨Âè∏; pinyin: Hu√°-Y√¨ Yƒ´np√≠n G≈çngsƒ´). After World War II in 1947 Chung-Shan invested HK$2,000,000 into Lai Chi Kok Hotel (traditional: ËçîÊûùËßíÈÖíÂ∫ó) expanding the 0.7 hectare enterprise to an eleven hectare estate which became Lai Chi Kok Amusement Park (traditional: ËçîÊûùÂúíÈÅäÊ®ÇÂ†¥) and operated from 1948 until the land was reallocated for public housing by the Hong Kong Government in 1997. Shak Chung-Shan was well recognised for his contributions to the Catholic Church and received and an award in 1953 from Pope Pius XII in January. Unfortunately his wife, Shak Wong Fung-Lin who is also Therese's mother died that same year. Born in 1908, Shak Wong Fung-Lin died February aged 45. Her remains are located in St. Michael Cemetery in Happy Valley, Hong Kong. One month after the death of Shak Wong Fung-Lin, Therese's stepfather remarried to Tso Pin-Chun (traditional: Â∑¶ËÅòÂêõ) in May, 1953. She was 37 years old and come from Beijing, at the time was the headmaster of Ho Tung Technical School For Girls (traditional: ‰ΩïÊù±Â•≥Â≠êËÅ∑Ê•≠Â≠∏Ê†°). It is implied Pin Chun and Chung-Shan had one son together. Shak Chung-Shan died in 1958 and raised a total of five children, two boys and three girls. His daughter Leung Man-fong (simplified: Ê¢ÅÊñáËä≥) founded Shak Chung Shan Memorial Catholic Primary School (traditional: Áü≥ÈêòÂ±±Á¥ÄÂøµÂ∞èÂ≠∏) in his memory in 1997.  Research  Theresa undertook extensive research into contemporary educational theory throughout her life. Therese's education is punctuated by long periods of time. After the death of her mother, the then 21 year old Therese W. H. Shak soon began her undergraduate degree at the University of Hong Kong. Shak completed her Bachelor of Arts in English 1957. In 1963 Shak was awarded a Graduate Certificate in Indigenous Education from the University of Hull aged 31. In 1972 Shak received her Master of Arts from the University of Hong Kong. Her thesis titled ‚ÄòA study of errors in the written English of Learners in Anglo-Chinese Secondary Schools in Hong Kong‚Äô explored the relationship between word length and grammatical errors in Anglo-Chinese schools. In 1982 Shak received a Master's of Education from the University of Hong Kong. Her thesis titled ‚ÄòAdministrative Arrangements and a Curriculum for a University Training Programme for Adult Educators in Hong Kong‚Äô aimed to address the requirements of adult education assessed though various research methods . In 1984 Shak began to undertake a Ph.D. at the University of British Columbia, delivering her doctoral defence in 1989 aged 57. Her doctoral thesis titled ‚ÄòLifelong Education: Definition, Agreement and Prediction‚Äô follows on from the Faure Report and UNESCO's 1972 model for lifelong education. The thesis then became the basis of her book ‚ÄòLifelong Education: Consensus in Characteristics & Practices‚Äô published in September 2009. In July 1994 Shak resumed post- doctoral research at the University of Hong Kong following her Ph.D. under the guidance of Professor Kai-Ming . Therese Shak may have undertaken some post- doctoral research at the IOE, University of London.  Career in Hong Kong  After obtaining her undergraduate degree from the University of Hong Kong, Shak appears to have immediately pursued a career in professional teaching. Therese's work history from 1957 to 1969 is not well known however she taught in St. Joan of Arc School, Hong Kong in this time alongside attending the University of Hull in 1963. In 1969 Shak worked in a senior administrative capacity at the Hong-Kong Caritas Higher & Adult Education Service, a position she held for 22 years until 1991; even after she relocated to the United Kingdom in 1989. While working here between 1969 and 1991 Shak also obtained her M.A., M.Ed. and PhD.  Career in Overseas Chinese Community  Therese's sister Catherine Shak experienced a traumatizing event in June 1989. As a result, Therese relocated to the United Kingdom to care for Catharine and left her position at the Hong-Kong Caritas Higher & Adult Education Service shortly after delivering her doctoral defence at University of British Columbia, Canada. Despite living in Golders Green from 1992 until her death in 2010, Therese's country of residence was France for much or all of this time. Dr. Therese Wai Han Shak beside Queen Elizabeth II at the opening of Camden Chinese Community Centre In October 1992 the Fung Shan Foundation was founded in the memory of Shak Chung-Shan and Shak Wong Fung-Lin by Therese and her sister Catherine. With support from Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster, UK and Caritas Hong Kong the foundation financed the establishment of the Ming-Ai Association and the Ming-Ai (London) Institute that same year. Shak would remain the Dean of the Ming-Ai (London) Institute for the duration of her natural life. Shak was a founding member and Chairperson of the East Asian Forum for Adult Education (EAFAE) founded in December 1993 in response the growing need for collaboration in Adult Education across East Asia seminars include representative from Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Macau, Thailand and Malaysia. In January 1995, Therese lost her sister, Catharine Shak who died in Middlesex. Catharine was a founding patron of the Ming-Ai (London) Institute. In September 1996, Shak become the director of the Camden Chinese Community Centre. She would maintain this role for the rest of her life and serve a year as a Secretary from 2002 to 2003. The community centre was officially opened in 2005 by Queen Elizabeth II. Shak was also involved in the establishment of other various cultural centres which are no longer operational in the UK and France. In 1999 Shak became the director of the Sino-UK Education Association. In 2001 Shak became the director of the Camden Training Network. In 2007 Shak founded the St. Thomas More Ming-Ai College. Each of these ventures appear to have been short lived and have since been dissolved.  Death and Memorials  Therese Shak died on 21 March 2010 aged 78, the day after her Birthday in Lourdes France. Her Memorial Mass as held on 31 May 2010 at the Cathedral of Immaculate Conception, Hong Kong. The Rev. John B. Tsang (traditional: ÊõæÊÖ∂ÊñáÁ•ûÁà∂) presided at the Mass. Her ashes joined those of her mother, Shak Wong Fung-Lin in St. Michael Cemetery in Happy Valley, Hong Kong.

Females can grow up to long, but the males are generally smaller. Taxonomy The male and female holotypes were originally identified as Phoneutria fasciata when they were first described by Lenz in 1886. In 1889, Eug√®ne Simon described and identified a male as P. pulchripes, placing it in the new genus Viridasius in the Ctenidae. In the same work, Simon described the genus Vulsor, which he would later merge with this one.

Career She saw action on the 9 July 1745 (according to the old style date, or 20 July 1745 according to the act of 1750 adopting the new Gregorian calendar), when she accompanied by the ship ‚ÄòElizabeth‚Äô (L'Elisabeth) she was fired upon by HMS Lion.National Maritime Museum The Du Teillay at the time was carrying Charles to Scotland. Prince Charles had boarded the French ship on 2 July 1745 (New style date) and left Saint-Nazaire on the 3 July 1745 (New style date) bound for Ardmolich. They were joined by a French escort ship the ‚ÄòElizabeth‚Äô on the island of Belle-Ile of the south-west coast of Brittany, but not until the 13 July 1745 (new style date). The ships departed from Belle-Ile on the 15 July 1745 (new style date). A few days later, they were intercepted by the ‚ÄòLion‚Äô, commanded by Captain Piercy Brett off the coast of Cornwall. A close action began at 17.00 between the ‚ÄòLion‚Äô and ‚ÄòElizabeth‚Äô, with the ‚ÄòDu Teillay‚Äô attacking the ‚ÄòLion‚Äô several times and, at 18.00, the ‚ÄòLion‚Äôs‚Äô mizzen topmast came down. By 20.00, The ‚ÄòLion‚Äô with her mizzen top and topmast shot away and hanging over the side was still in close action with the ‚ÄòElizabeth‚Äô. The ‚ÄòDu Teillay‚Äô shielded by the Elizabeth continued firing at the ‚ÄòLion‚Äô who returned fire with her stern guns. The ‚ÄòLion‚Äô continued firing at the ‚ÄòElizabeth‚Äô until the latter broke free at 22.00 to join the ‚ÄòDu Teillay‚Äô; by this time the ‚ÄòLion‚Äô was too damaged to follow, with 52 of her men were dead and about 110 wounded. The ‚ÄòElizabeth‚Äô had lost about 57 men with 175 wounded with her commander, Captain Dau, among the dead, obliging her to give up and return to France, leaving the Du Teillay to proceed alone. On 23 July 1745 (old style date) i.e. 2nd of August 1745 (new style date), the 'Du Teillay' arrived at Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides with his 'seven men of Moidart', before sailing onto Loch nan Uamh where Charles disembarked two days later, the ship then returning to Brittany.

Lin- Manuel Miranda wrote both the music and lyrics to the song. It speaks of Aaron Burrs undying determination in the face of Hamilton's swift rise to influence and power. Background Miranda explained that the song's refrain appeared to him essentially in its final state while taking the subway to a friend's party. He sang the melodic refrain into his iPhone, briefly attended the party, then completed the song on his trip home. It was at this party that Miranda heard Megan Amos recite \\"death doesn't discriminate between the sinners and the saints\\", and with Amos' permission, included the line as a subtle nod to the night of the party; of which he claims to be a memorable night. He has commented that \\"Wait for It\\" and \\"The Room Where It Happens\\" are \\"two of the best songs I've ever written in my life and Leslie Odom Jr. got them both\\". Odom originated the role of Aaron Burr on Broadway. Miranda further explained the out-of-context significance of the song: \\"I feel like I have been Burr in my life as many times as I have been Hamilton. I think we've all had moments where we've seen friends and colleagues zoom past us, to success, or to marriage, or to homeownership, while we lingered where we were‚Äîbroke, single, jobless. And you tell yourself, 'Wait for it.'\\" Synopsis After contemplating his own misfortunes, and Alexander Hamilton's successes, Aaron Burr decides to hang on for now and lie in wait, knowing that his time to shine is coming soon. The A.V. Club further explains \\"the song finds sympathy for Burr's chronic caution; with a legacy and reputation to protect, he can't risk as much as the ambitious Hamilton, and what will become a murderous rage begins here as mournful jealousy over his rival's ability to openly work for what he wants and believes in\\". Style Pitchfork wrote that the song \\"moves with a dancehall lilt\\". Allmusic described it as a \\"tender pop ballad\\". Critical reception The song has received critical acclaim. The Huffington Post wrote that the song \\"has perhaps the most profound lyrics of the entire libretto\\", and praised its ability to present Burr as a tragic hero rather than a villain, noting \\"it complicates everything that comes after because we find ourselves rooting for him\\". Jezebel noted that this song is \\"stand-alone enough outside the narrative that it contains no real spoilers\\", and further described it as a \\"rich...post-Gyptian meditation\\". Vibe wrote that in this song, Burr \\"lifts his own spirits up.\\" The A.V. Club listed it as one of 20 musical theater numbers from the past 20 years that should become standards, writing that the number, \\"one of the catchiest, most haunting numbers of an already landmark show...may be the track that best expresses the show's complex perspective\\". New York Theatre said it was \\"one of Odom's show- stopping numbers in the musical\\". The Daily Telegraph said it is an \\"instant classic anthem\\". Screen Fellows writes that the \\"powerful\\" song \\"make[s] a moving case for [Burr's] humanity\\" by portraying him as an \\"ultimately sympathetic character\\". DVC Inquirer deemed it a \\"standout track\\". Vogue praised the song as being a \\"Broadway crossover hits [that] sound[s] like bona fide iTunes single\\".  Recordings  Leslie Odom Jr. performed the song for the 2015 cast album. The Hamilton Mixtape, which was released in December 2016, includes a recording of the song in a different arrangement with Usher as the lead vocalist. Usher's version peaked at number 16 on the R&B; Digital Song Sales chart.

Having achieved some success as a novelist, in 1953 he became a film critic, contributing regularly for Le Monde till 1983. Life Marie Joseph Henri Jean de Baroncelli was born in Paris a few months before the outbreak of the First World War. On his father's death he would become the tenth Marquis of Baroncelli, although the title was little mentioned. His father was the pioneering film director, Jacques de Baroncelli and the family was based in southern France. More remotely the family, which had grown prosperous through commerce during the nineteenth century, traced their origins back to Tuscany. De Baroncelli studied Law and Humanities, emerging with a degree from the prestigious Institut d'√©tudes politiques de Paris (Sciences Po). During the 1940s he had several novels published including the wartime novel \\"Vingt-six hommes\\" (1942 - \\"Twenty-six men\\"), and \\"Le disgraci√©\\" (1946) He married the theatre star Sophie Desmarets in October 1950 and the couple moved into an old farm that he had inherited on the northwestern side of Montpellier where for several years during the summers they followed a celebrity life-style, with frequent parties. However, unseasonal frost in 1956 ruined the wine harvest that year and much of the farmland had to be sold. Further land sales followed, and most of the 300 hectares had been sold and developed for housing by the later 1960s. Meanwhile, the couple's daughter was born in 1952. From 1953 till 1983 he contributed regularly to Le Monde, supplying numerous film reviews along with interviews and investigative pieces. He served on several film festival juries (Berlin 1957, Cannes 1958 and 1963, and Venice 1961). At one stage he was a member of the organising committee for the Cannes Film Festival. He has also featured several times on French radio the arts and review programme \\"Le Masque et la Plume\\". He was an early contributor to Lib√©ration, originally a resistance newspaper, and was a founding member of Association fran√ßaise des cin√©mas d'art et d'essai (Confederation of Arts Cinemas).

It used styling cues from Chrysler Airflow cars. Most of the units produced, a few hundred, were fitted with streamlined tank truck bodies, and were used by major oil companies, like Texaco, Socony-Vacuum Oil Company and Esso. Airflow trucks were based on standard Dodge models, so from an engineering point of view they were rather conventional, despite their striking look. Five model names were assigned successively to the Airflow production; namely K-52, LM-70, LM-71, RX-70 and RX-71. Garwood Industries and Heil Co. of Milwaukee, Wis, among others, were the producers of the tank bodies; while the bodies of two beer trucks for Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company were built by H. Barkow Co., of Milwaukee. Other streamlined tanker trucks By the same years other streamlined tanker bodies were fitted to more conventional chassis-cabs of other truck makers, like Mack, International and Diamond T. Specially unconventional and noteworthy were the impressive Texaco's Diamond T Doodlebug tankers, designed by the futuristic industrial designer Norman Bel Geddes. They featured a Heil low profile body and used a Hercules six-cylinder engine mounted in the rear and a large radiator behind it. Air pressure actuated the four-speed gearbox and clutch, using the same pneumatic system for braking. A compound-curved windshield and curved side glass were also noticeable features. In Australia the Socony Vacuum Oil Company owned several remarkable streamlined Reo Speed Tankers. These trucks were built on Reo Cab over-engine three-Ton chassis.

Most famously, in the late 1980s and 1990s the Republic of Ireland manager Jack Charlton sought out players in England and used what became known as the \\"granny rule\\", with the stronger pool of talent helping the team to qualify for several tournaments, which had never been achieved prior to Charlton's appointment. There were a few England-born internationals in the squads of that era who had been raised in Ireland and learned to play football at local clubs, not least Paul McGrath and David O'Leary as well as Curtis Fleming and Stephen McPhail.

Slowe started his career as a youth player at Brighton & Hove Albion, however he left to focus on school work and exams. At the age of 17, he headed to Ghana to pursue his footballing career after not attaining the grades he wanted. He helped found the Cantonments Soccer Academy in 2006, and spent two seasons with the first team. In 2008, he was offered a contract with Cypriot side Onisilos Sotira, having impressed two Newcastle United scouts who happened to be in Ghana at the time. He spent two seasons with Sotira, before being offered trials with English sides AFC Wimbledon and Gillingham. As he was still under contract in Cyprus, he was not allowed to accept these trial offers. He was also offered a trial with Newcastle, but due to the Icelandic volcanic eruption of 2010, he had to travel for 4 days to reach England. He was injured in his first training session, and ultimately was not selected for the team. Slowe joined Northampton Town in 2010, but despite making the bench a number of times, he never made a first team appearance and was released the next year. He then joined Yeovil Town, but again failed to make a first team appearance in his one season there.

The route was originally a railway, the Oldham Loop Line, which was built in stages: The first railway to reach Oldham was a branch line which opened in March 1842, constructed by the Manchester and Leeds Railway (M&LR;). This line ran from Middleton Junction, from the Manchester to Leeds line which had opened the previous year, to Oldham Werneth railway station: Oldham Werneth was located inconveniently from the town centre in the lower part of Oldham, so in 1847, the line was extended one mile to Oldham Mumps railway station. By this time the Manchester and Leeds Railway had become part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR). In August 1863, a six-mile (10 km) extension was opened from Oldham Mumps to Rochdale, also connecting to the Manchester-Leeds line, effectively creating a loop from Middleton to Rochdale. The line between Middleton Junction and Oldham was steeply inclined and therefore difficult to work; until 1854 the line had been cable-worked. In 1873, the LYR obtained an act to build a more direct, and less steeply inclined line between Oldham and Manchester, running via Failsworth, and joining the Manchester-Leeds line at Thorpes Bridge Junction. This line was opened in May 1880, therefore completing what became known as the Oldham Loop Line. The original line from Middleton Junction to Oldham closed in 1964. Unlike the Bury and Altrincham lines, the Oldham line was never electrified, and was operated by steam and then, from 1958, by diesels. =Conversion to Metrolink= The Oldham Loop Line was identified by transport planners in the 1980s, as one of the local railway lines in the Greater Manchester area, which was used mostly for local traffic, and could therefore be split off from the main line network and converted to light-rail operation.Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (1984). \\"Light Rapid Transit in Greater Manchester\\". GMPTE. - publicity brochure The network was however to be built in stages, and the Oldham line was not included in the first phase of the Metrolink in the early 1990s due to cost reasons. The Bury Line and Altrincham Line being chosen for conversion instead. The line was however included in the third phase of the system's development, which also included new lines to Ashton-under-Lyne, East Didsbury and Manchester Airport. Several new features were to be included as part of the conversion: *In order to better serve Oldham town centre, a new street running line was to be constructed, with four new stops at , , and . This would allow a 1.5 mile (2.4 km) section of the old railway through the former Oldham Mumps railway station to be abandoned. *In order to better serve Rochdale town centre, a short street-running line was to be constructed from to . *In addition to these, several entirely new stops were to be added on the former railway sections at , , and . Railway operations ended on 3 October 2009, and the Oldham Loop Line was closed for conversion. The line was completely rebuilt, with all of the former infrastructure, including the former stations and station buildings demolished, and replaced, and overhead wiring added. A M5000 tram running through Union Street, on the Oldham town centre line opened in January 2014. The line was re-opened in phases: Tram services started on 13 June 2012 between Manchester and : As a temporary measure, until the town centre line was completed, the former railway line through Oldham Mumps was retained, and a temporary tram stop constructed in place of the former railway station. A permanent stop called Oldham Mumps was later opened on the town centre line in a different location. Services were extended to on 16 December 2012, and to Rochdale Railway Station on 28 February 2013. The Oldham town centre line opened on 27 January 2014, allowing the section of former railway line, and temporary stop at Oldham Mumps to be permanently closed. The Rochdale town centre line opened on 31 March 2014. Proposed future development In January 2016, Jim McMahon, MP for Oldham West and Royton, proposed two loop extensions to the metrolink system around Oldham. The link would add a spur from Westwood tram stop to Middleton town centre, before joining the Bury Line near , in line with the proposed Middleton extension. The Ashton Loop would extend the line beyond Ashton town centre to Oldham Mumps. Both would connect Rochdale to its neighbouring towns without the need to travel in and out of Manchester city centre. Initial high level feasibility work was undertaken by officials at Transport for Greater Manchester which demonstrated the route is technically possible. Services As of February 2018, the ORL forms the northern half of the Metrolink route 5 which runs as follows: *During daytime hours Mondays to Saturdays, trams run every six minutes from in south Manchester, via Victoria and Oldham to , half of these continue to Rochdale Town Centre every twelve minutes. On weekday evenings and Sundays the frequency is reduced to 12 minutes on the whole route and all trams run through to Rochdale Town Centre.

It built on the tradition of the penny gaff and \\"singing saloon\\". Writing in the mid-1860s, Thomas Wright as itinerant social observer found penny readings \\"exceedingly popular all over the country\\". Australian historian Joy Damousi documented the criticism by Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin of this passive consumption of literature through reading aloud, fitting as it did into Victorian culture and in particular poetry recitation. Penny readings, however, appealed for a period in both urban and country settings. They were significant as a way forward for the Mechanics' Institutes set up in the early Victorian period, where they became a staple activity, along with smoking concerts and study for scientific qualifications. In the fictionalised Candleford Green of Flora Thompson, the penny reading, although outmoded elsewhere, was \\"still going strong\\" in the 1890s. Origins The Public Reading Society founded in the 1850s was the vehicle of Charles John Plumptre, a barrister who turned to the teaching of elocution. Charles Sulley, editor of the Ipswich Express, was credited with starting the penny reading movement in Suffolk during the 1850s. A short history was given in the 1865 standard reading collection edited by Joseph Edwards Carpenter. The Rev. James Fleming of Bath was also credited as the \\"father of the penny- reading movement\\", for his numerous public readings. Another view places the origin in 1854 in the Midlands. Dispatches for The Times from the Crimean War, by William Howard Russell, were read in public in Hanley by Samuel Taylor, a manual worker who was a Mechanics' Institute secretary and later involved in the Staffordshire Sentinel newspaper. From the market square, Taylor moved to the town hall, and in 1856 to a fuller programme of patriotic readings, with music and the national anthem; from free admittance to a penny charge to cut down great demand. The Times made much of the events, which were widely copied in the Potteries and Staffordshire by 1857‚Äì8. At the Birmingham and Midland Institute, William Mattieu Williams started to give \\"penny lectures\\" in 1856, and C. J. Woodward later claimed that these led to \\"penny classes\\" and penny readings, in the cause of popular education.s:Williams, William Mattieu (DNB00) In 1871, a book review in the Literary World lamented the trend: > As conducted by their originators, Penny Readings were unquestionably useful > and attractive without being frivolous: as conducted by some of those > gentlemen's imitators, they [have] run riot and become farcical, and have > lost almost every philanthropic or praiseworthy element they at first > possessed. Content An 1887 handbook for parish priests suggests a programme of around 15 items, \\"instrumental pieces, songs, glees, recitation, and readings\\", recommending variety. It notes that \\"Comic songs should, as a rule, be avoided\\". Legacy While penny readings, at their height in the 1860s, had lost their popularity before 1900, a tradition of poetry recitation continued in niches such as family events and temperance meetings. Winifred Peck found it \\"ghastly\\" and associated, negatively, with the provincial. The Poetry Society, founded in 1909 as the Poetry Recital Society, began with a parallel mission to the \\"penny reading movement\\": event organisation to promote performance of the spoken word. In terms of its content and patrons, on the other hand, it was more discriminating, and lacked the same broad base of appeal.

K. Jemisin. It was awarded the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 2016. It is the first volume in the Broken Earth series and is followed by The Obelisk Gate and The Stone Sky. Setting The Fifth Season takes place on a planet with a single supercontinent called the Stillness. Every few centuries, its inhabitants endure what they call a \\"Fifth Season\\" of catastrophic climate change. = Society = The society of the Stillness is broken up into many \\"comms\\", \\"use- castes\\", ethnicities and species. * Orogenes: People with the ability to control energy, particularly that of the ground (directly) and temperature (indirectly). They can cause and prevent earthquakes, and when angered can unintentionally kill living things in their \\"torus\\", or area of influence, by stealing the heat from their bodies to use as energy to manipulate the ground. When this occurs, a visible circle of frost appears around them and living things can be flash-frozen solid. They are widely hated and feared, and many are murdered by small-town mobs when their powers are discovered in childhood. If they are not killed by their family or community, they are given to a Guardian, to be trained at a location called the Fulcrum inside the city of Yumenes. Fulcrum-trained orogenes are marked by their black uniforms and are tolerated slightly better than untrained orogenes, in that they are not murdered quite as often. They wear rings on their fingers to denote rank, ten- ring being the highest. The slur \\"rogga\\" is used against orogenes, who likewise call non-orogenes \\"the stills\\". The orogenes of the Fulcrum are tasked with servicing the comms of the Stillness in many different ways, such as clearing debris, reproducing inside the compound and quelling micro-shakes. * Guardians: Warriors, hunters, and assassins tasked with controlling orogenes through pain and training or, alternatively, execution. They are the order that watches the Fulcrum. * Geomests: Academics who study \\"geomestry\\", which seems to be a discipline unique to the Stillness, combining the study of geology with chemistry and other physical sciences. * Commless: People without the protection of a settlement or \\"comm\\", either by choice or due to expulsion from a comm. * Stone Eaters: Moving sculpture-like beings. * Sanzed Equatorial Affiliation: The ruling Empire. The nation is informally known as Old Sanze. * Equatorials: People who live in the more stable and wealthy equatorial-region cities such as Yumenes and Dibars. * Midlatters: People of either the north (Nomidlats) or south (Somidlats) areas adjacent to the equator zone. Considered backwater. Most Midlatters are multiracial. Use-castes: * Strongbacks: A laborer caste. Excess Strongbacks are thrown out of comms during Seasons. * Resistants: A caste of people thought to be resistant to sickness or famine. They care for the sick, clean latrines, and perform other health and hygiene-related tasks. * Breeders: The caste assigned to keep a comm's numbers stable. They produce children themselves or authorize comm members with desirable traits to have children. Unauthorized children produced during a Season are not granted a share of the comm's stores and may therefore starve. * Innovators: An inventor/intellectual caste. Engineers, doctors, and other problem-solvers. * Leadership: A caste of people trained to run the comm or other important organizations. Can be pushed into leadership against their will, if the comm has sufficient need.  Plot  In a prologue, an extraordinarily powerful orogene discusses the sad state of the world and laments the oppression of his race. He then uses his enormous power to fracture the entire continent along its length, threatening to cause the worst Fifth Season in recorded history. The story then follows three female orogenes across the Stillness from different time periods: Essun, Damaya, and Syenite. = Essun = Essun is a middle-aged woman with two young children living in a small southern comm named Tirimo. Secretly, she is an orogene, a human with the ability to manipulate earth and stone by absorbing or redirecting heat and energy from elsewhere. Her children have orogenic abilities as well, which often manifest themselves subconsciously, requiring Essun to constantly work to avoid their discovery. One day, she arrives home to find her young son has been beaten to death by her husband after inadvertently revealing his orogenic abilities. Her husband has taken her daughter and left town. Numb with grief and rage, she instinctually shunts the massive earthquake from the events of the prologue, which has just arrived from up north, around the comm. This saves it from complete destruction, but alerts the townspeople an orogene is present. Due to the massive earthquake and ominous signs coming from the north, the townspeople are aware that a Fifth Season is likely imminent. When Essun attempts to leave the village she is outed as an orogene, and an angry mob attempts to kill her. In a rage, she kills many townspeople by leaching the heat from their bodies, freezing them solid, accidentally destroying the comm's only water supply in the process. She runs away, intent on following her husband and reclaiming her daughter. Soon after leaving the comm, she encounters Hoa, a strange boy with ice-white skin and hair, who begins following her. He does not appear to be human and eats rocks for sustenance. She suspects he may be a Stone Eater, a strange race of living statues that can move through solid rock, but she has never seen one move around above the ground before. Later she meets Tonkee, a commless and curious person. Together, they journey south, encountering the vast devastation caused by the \\"rifting\\" up north. Eventually, they arrive at a hidden comm called Castrima, built in a huge underground geode. = Damaya = Damaya is a young girl in a northern comm, recently discovered by her parents to be an orogene. Unable to bring themselves to kill her, they summon Schaffa, a Guardian, to collect her. The Guardians are an ancient order of humans with supernatural abilities whose sole task is to manage and control orogenes. They control the Fulcrum, an organization that trains orogenes to use their abilities in a controlled fashion; nevertheless, orogenes remain a hated and feared sub-class with no rights of their own. As the two travel from Damaya's home to the Fulcrum, Schaffa begins the training that Damaya will need in order to become a trained orogene. In his first lesson, Schaffa breaks Damaya's hand, challenging her to control her powers even when in great pain. His job, he tells her, is to keep the world safe from her. When she passes his test, they continue on their journey. Damaya learns quickly and progresses through the ranks of young orogenes, learning to control her powers. One night, the young daughter of a wealthy and politically-connected family sneaks into the compound, curious about the interior of the largest building. Damaya reluctantly helps her enter, where they find a huge faceted pit, lined with sharp iron shards. Damaya is discovered, and one of the Guardians attempts to kill her; however, Schaffa steps in and spares Damaya's life. He also tells her that she will need to immediately take her first ring test‚Äîa test not normally given to orogenes until they have had much more training. In asking this of her, Schaffa is giving her a chance to save herself. She may have broken the rules of the Fulcrum, but if she can prove that she can control her powers and become a useful orogene, the Guardians will let her live. Damaya passes the test, is formally inducted into the Fulcrum, and is allowed to choose her new name. = Syenite = Syenite, a rising orogene star in the Fulcrum, is forcibly partnered with Alabaster, the most powerful living orogene, in order to conceive a child with him on a business trip to the countryside. Though they loathe each other, they have no choice in the matter. As they travel to their destination, Alabaster frequently alludes to hidden knowledge about the obelisks, strange crystals the size of buildings that drift amongst the clouds. They are assumed by most to be inert leftovers from a long-dead civilization. Along the way, Alabaster shows her one of the node stations that the Fulcrum has positioned around the Stillness. Officially, each contains an orogene whose job it is to constantly quell small earthquakes that could endanger the larger continent, and it is assumed to be dull work. Alabaster reveals the reality, which is that the orogenes in the nodes have all been mutilated and lobotomized from an early age, to allow them to quell quakes by instinct but subjecting them to constant agony and suffering. Alabaster reveals that the boy in this node is one of his offspring. That many of the orogenes in nodes are his, all with the same strength he has, and yet there are almost no other at his level in the Fulcrum. Syenite is horrified by the discovery. The two arrive at their destination, a coastal city that is losing business due to a large reef blocking the harbor; their task is to move the reef. This is far beneath Alabaster's abilities, but soon after their arrival he barely survives an assassination attempt, forcing Syenite to try to clear the harbor alone. To her shock, she discovers that the blockage is, in fact, an obelisk lying on its side underwater, which responds to her presence and rises up out of the water. Alarmed by this interaction between orogenes and the obelisk, the Fulcrum sends a Guardian to kill them both. The Guardian succeeds in incapacitating Alabaster, and is just about to kill Syenite when she instinctively reaches out to the obelisk with her power. The obelisk completely destroys the town and Syenite passes out. Syenite awakens much later on a populated island off the coast, having been rescued along with Alabaster by a Stone Eater called Antimony. The island's leader is Innon, a very rare example of an untrained orogene living openly in society. She and Alabaster are accepted there, and both eventually enter into a loving polyamorous relationship with Innon. Syenite conceives a child with Alabaster, and raises him in peace on the island for a few years. However, they are eventually discovered by the Fulcrum, who sends multiple ships with Guardians to retrieve them. Alabaster is abducted by Stone Eaters before he can mount a successful defense. Innon is killed in front of Syenite by one of the Guardians, and Schaffa approaches to take her child from her. She smothers her child rather than allow it to suffer in the Fulcrum or be lobotomized for the node stations. In her grief and anger, she draws power from a nearby obelisk, destroying the ship and killing most of the Guardians present as well as many fleeing islanders. = Essun = Reaching Castrima, Essun realizes that an old acquaintance has been waiting for her: Alabaster. Here it is revealed that Damaya, Syenite, and Essun are all the same woman at different points in her life; Syenite (the older Damaya) and Alabaster survived the attack on the island, and she went into hiding as Essun to try to start a new life while Alabaster has been living in enforced isolation amongst the Stone Eaters. Essun realizes that it was Alabaster who cracked the continent in half, triggering the present Fifth Season and likely dooming civilization in the process. He states that it was necessary to accomplish his plan to finally end the Fifth Seasons, and concludes with: \\"Have you ever heard of something called a moon?\\"  Characters  Names in the Stillness are denoted by given name followed by use-caste (profession) followed by comm (community, town, or city). For instance, Schaffa Guardian Warrant is a Guardian named Schaffa from the comm Warrant. Orogenes go by a (usually) geological-themed first name, the use-caste Orogene, and their comm, the Fulcrum. * Damaya: a child who is given to a Guardian after she is discovered to be an orogene. She is from a comm called Palela in the Nomidlats (northern middle latitudes). * Schaffa Guardian Warrant: a man responsible for Damaya's training. His skin is \\"almost white, he's so paper-pale; he must smoke and curl up in strong sunlight\\". He has \\"long flat hair\\" in \\"a deep heavy black\\". He has \\"silvery-gray\\" or \\"icewhite\\" eyes. * Syenite: also known as Syen, an ambitious, four-ring level orogene of the Fulcrum, who is instructed to go on a mission with a higher level orogene named Alabaster. * Alabaster: a ten-ring (highest) level orogene, capable of quelling super-volcanoes and of power and control beyond the capabilities of other orogenes. He has \\"skin so black it's almost blue\\", his hair is \\"dense, tight-curled stuff, the kind of hair that needs to be shaped if it's to look stylish\\", and he is \\"whipcord thin\\". * Essun: an orogene mother of two, who leaves her small town of Tirimo to pursue her husband and daughter. Unlike the others, Essun's chapters are written in the second-person point of view, present-tense. She is described initially as \\"flabby\\", with dreadlocked curly hair and skin that is \\"unpleasantly ocher-brown by some standards and unpleasantly olive-pale by others\\". * Jija: Essun's husband, who kills their son Uche and kidnaps their daughter Nassun. * Hoa: a mysterious boy who finds Essun in the woods and accompanies her on her journey. His coloring is completely white, including his icewhite eyes. * Feldspar: Syenite's instructor at the Fulcrum, who orders her to go on a mission with Alabaster to clear a coral blockage in the Allia harbor. * Tonkee (aka Binof Leadership Yumenes): The daughter of a powerful family who enlists the help of Damaya as children. Later encountered as a university-trained but commless geomest (a scientist who studies the earth, chemistry, and physics) who now lives in a cave. * Innon Resistant Meov: a leader of an island community of pirates. He is described as an outgoing \\"six-and-a-half-foot-tall man with a huge mane of braids and clothes from three different nations‚Äîall of it garish.\\" Minor characters: * Lerna: a young doctor in Tirimo who takes care of Essun briefly after her son's death. * Rask Innovator Tirimo: the town's elected headsman. * Muh Dear: Damaya's grandmother. * Mother: Damaya's mother, a Strongback. * Father: Damaya's father, a Resistant. * Asael Leadership Allia: one of six deputy governors of Allia. * Heresmith Leadership Allia: the lieutenant governor of Allia. Reception The New York Times review stated \\"The Fifth Season invites us to imagine a dismantling of the earth in both the literal and the metaphorical sense, and suggests the possibility of a richer and more fundamental escape.

It is thought that he was born in Devon. Young was apprenticed to a joiner and woodcarver, and was admitted to the Joiners' Company as a freeman in 1670, at the age of about 20. In 1685, he acquired 14 acres of land in Kensington which he sought to develop, and as he later described it in 1701, \\"did sett out and appoint a considerable part thereof to be built into a large Square of large and substantial Houses fit for ye Habitacion of persons of good Worth and Quality, with Courts and Yards before and Gardens lying backwards\\". This was Kensington Square. From 1692 onwards, the central garden was laid out. Young attempted to develop Kensington Square alone, but had financial problems, which led him to sell plots to other developers, and to borrow more money. He was eventually jailed in the King's Bench Prison for debt. He was backed by Thomas Sutton, who persuaded him to give more equity to Sutton to prevent other creditors from seizing his remaining land, and to help obtain his release. However, after Young left prison, he was not able to repay his loan to Sutton, got into debt again, and spent almost ten years in Fleet Prison. He ended up having to bring a case against Sutton. Young Street, which runs north-south from Kensington High Street to Kensington Square, is named after him.

Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical or rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from April to October and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical capsule long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus mannensis was first formally described in 1964 by Cliff Boomsma from a specimen collected on Angas Downs Head Station. The description was published in Transactions of the Royal Society of South Australia. In 1992, Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus mannensis Boomsma subsp. mannensis has glossy adult leaves, the largest of which are usually more than wide; * Eucalyptus mannensis subsp. vespertina L.A.S.Johnson & K.D.Hill has adult leaves that are dull at first, the largest adult leaves less than wide. Distribution and habitat Mann Range mallee grows on plains and dunes in open shrubland and has a wide distribution in the central ranges of Australia, including in South Australia, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. There are also disjunct populations in the Great Victoria Desert, near Wiluna and near Shark Bay. Subspecies vespertina is restricted to near-coastal areas between the Murchison River and Shark Bay.

Semantics A term whose meaning is synonymous with eurotophobia is kolpophobia; however; the scope of kolpophobia can sometimes be broader, allowing for the inclusion of all sex organs. Although eurotophobia does not have an interlingual classical compound, kolpophobia has a Greek etymological derivation with the prefix kolpo meaning a fold that usually alludes to the vulva. Eurotophobia is a hyponym of genitophobia. On the other hand, the term vaginaphobia is used to denote fear of female genitals in the context of sexual orientation. The male counterpart that analogously corresponds with this condition is called phallophobia. Origin Such an exhibit of detestation for the female genitalia can originate from some innate inherency, or learned from frequent denunciations of one's aesthetic appearance and aberrating comments during childhood. Sometimes eurotophobia is a spin-off of aversion to perceived by- products of the female genitalia, such as discharge or mucus. The condition can manifest itself in both men and women and is at times triggered by some strenuous event. This phenomenon has also been observed in medical students, particularly those in the field of obstetrics, at times leading to dropping out. According to the online Romanian women's magazine Ele, the appropriation of this condition by women may lead to various symptoms including depression and self-harm and that it originates from a highly prudish and puritanical upbringing. Other explanations posit the transmission of urban legends such as vagina dentata or Freudian concepts such as castration anxiety. Eurotophobes may also have developed their condition after being molested by an adult female.Faller, Kathleen Coulborn. \\"The Causes of Sexual Abuse.\\" Child Sexual Abuse. Macmillan Education UK, 1988. 89-115. Peculiarities Although an average individual may have an aversion to particular bodyparts, the hallmark of eurotophobia is that it exceeds the disinclinations shown by most people, and is a trait that can inauspiciously affect both men and women. The condition is sometimes linked to erotophobia and can affect an individual's confidence in social and professional interactions. The condition can emanate from both a direct antipathy, to a woman's vicarious perception of what others, such as a spouse, might think of her vulva. Symptoms include anxiety, inhibition, distractions, anaphrodisia and an inability to construct a romantic relationship. People with such inclinations may express a compounded desire to substitute audible mentions of the vulva with euphemisms. The extent of the condition varies from person to person, with some feeling a sense of repulsion, others reacting only once evoked, avoidance of thinking about female sex organs or a sense of deep fear. Eurotophobia has also been given an account by Planned Parenthood in the lexicon section of their publications. Rather than being an anomaly, some historical works point to cultures wherein eurotophobic behavior was mainstream, such as those where couples would avoid copulating in illuminated areas to ensure the vulva remained out of sight.Fahs, Breanne. \\"Genital panics: Constructing the vagina in women's qualitative narratives about pubic hair, menstrual sex, and vaginal self- image.\\" Body image 11.3 (2014): 210-218 Fear or embarrassment while discussing the vagina manifests itself in some women with health problems, which may impede diagnosing or tackling certain medical conditions.

The club is almost entirely made up of Hindustani people, and as such was the first Hindustani football club to qualify and compete in the Hoofdklasse, the top flight of football in Suriname. There are two other Surinamese football clubs by the same name, one from Meerzorg, and one from Nickerie. All three clubs compete in their respective districts and in the Inter district tournaments.  History  Founded on 2 October 1932 in Kwatta, Wanica District, S.C.S. Jai-Hind was named after the Indian patriotic battle cry \\"Jai Hind\\" (Hindi: ‡§ú‡§Ø ‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶) by the local villagers of Hindustani descent. The club is mostly made up of farmers from the small village who originally played on a cow field, where the cows would need to be chased away before each match and the cow dung removed. The maintenance of the playing field was kept up by the players themselves, who would use hewers to cut the grass. The team players are all farmhands who spend their days getting up early, milking the cows, working on the fields and coming home to rice, beans and mud fish. The highlight of the week is when chicken (rasfowru) is prepared for the villagers. Spending most of their days working the land the players of Jai-Hind practice three times a week, playing organized matches on the weekends. The players of Jai-Hind are known for their physical strength which is a direct result of farming in an environment where most tasks are still performed by hand, such as digging, plowing, shoveling, weeding and watering the plants. In 1970 Jai-Hind were promoted to the SVB Hoofdklasse, the top tier of football in Suriname. The final match of the previous Eerste Klasse season was against Nautico Rio. The players received the first official playing kits ahead of the match. As the team took the bus to the stadium, they were surprised by how many Hindustani people had showed up. Never in the history of football in Suriname had a Hindustani club come this close to qualifying for the top flight. To the players surprise the stadium was closed. Due to heavy rainfall the match had been rescheduled for the following day. No one in the village of Kwatta had a telephone at the time, so it was not possible for the SVB to notify the team of the cancellation. The next day the match was held in front of a sold out crowd. The first time an Eerste Klasse match had sold out, and also the first time a match from the Eerste Klasse was broadcast live on the radio. Jai-Hind went on to win the match, thus promoting to the SVB Hoofdklasse, the goal scorers were Jagroep, Soekhnandan \\"Gama\\" Kewalapat (2x), the assists for both the second and third goal were given by Soerinder Ratchasing. That season Soekhnandan Kewalapat also finished as the top scorer of the Eerste Klasse with 23 goals. It was the first time a Hindustani player had achieved this feat in Suriname. Later a small sporting complex was built in the town. The Sport Complex Kwatta, a small multi-purpose sporting facility which now serves as the home grounds for the club.

In 1976 she became the first Hispanic woman principal in the Denver Public Schools system. She was also the first Hispanic president of the Denver Classroom Teachers' Association and the Colorado Library Association, and the first female president of the Latin American Education Foundation. She was instrumental in the founding of several political and community advocacy groups for Latinos and served on numerous city and community boards. Following her retirement in 1979, she became a full-time volunteer for the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985. In 2002 the Denver Public Schools system dedicated the Lena L. Archuleta Elementary School in northeast Denver in her honor. Early life and education Town of Raton, New Mexico in 1909 Lena Lovato was born in Clapham, New Mexico, to Eusebio Lovato, a shoe repairman and World War I veteran, and his wife Dominguita. She was an eighth-generation Mexican American. She had one sister. In 1922 the family moved to Raton, where she graduated from Raton High School. She obtained a scholarship to the University of Denver, where she majored in Spanish and minored in Latin and education, graduating with a B.A. in education. In 1951 she earned her master's degree in library science at the University of Denver. Career In 1942 she began working in the Northern New Mexico Normal School in El Rito, teaching music and Spanish. She married a year later, and in 1951 she and her husband relocated to Denver. Archuleta joined the Denver Public Schools system as a teacher and school librarian at Westwood Elementary School and, in 1953, Kepner Middle School. In the 1960s she began working in administration, becoming the coordinator of the Department of Library Services, supervisor of the Office of Community Relations, and supervisor of Federal bilingual education projects for Denver Public Schools. In 1976 Archuleta became the first Hispanic woman principal in the Denver Public Schools system with her appointment at Fairview Elementary School. She retired in 1979, the same year as her husband. Following her retirement from teaching and administration, Archuleta undertook full-time volunteer work. She was active in the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) as both a member of the board of directors and an advocate, opening an AARP chapter in her own apartment building. To enhance her effectiveness, Archuleta took a public speaking course and thereafter conducted free public forums to educate seniors about their health care options. Latino advocacy Archuleta was instrumental in the founding of several Latino advocacy groups. In 1964 she co-founded the Latin American Research and Service Agency (LARASA), a Latino political advocacy and community development organization. In 1976 she was one of the eight founders of the Mi Casa Resource Center for Women, a job training and employment development organization. In 2000 she helped found Circle of Latina Leadership, a leadership training group for Hispanic women in Denver, and mentored many of its participants. Affiliations Archuleta was the first Hispanic president of the Denver Classroom Teachers' Association and the Colorado Library Association, and the first female president of the Latin American Education Foundation. She was an advisory council member of the Latino/a Research & Policy Center and a board member of LARASA, Brothers' Redevelopment, Community Colleges and Occupational Education, Circle of Latina Leadership, Rude Park Community Nursery, the Denver Public Library Commission, the Denver Landmark Preservation Commission, and the Denver Planning Board. She was a committee member of the Hospice of Metro Denver and the Denver Catholic Archdiocese finance committee. She served on the board of directors of AARP, and from 1990 to 1996 was the board's vice-president, being the first Hispanic woman to hold that position. She was also president of the Greater Denver Rainbow Chapter of AARP and represented Colorado at the 1995 White House Conference on Aging. Awards and honors Archuleta received the Bernie Valdez Community Service Award from LARASA, the Civis Princeps (First Citizen) Citation in Humanitarianism from Regis University, the Hispanic Annual Salute, and the Denver Hispanic Chamber of Commerce \\"Famous Firsts\\" Award, among other local honors. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985. In 1999 she received a Distinguished Service Award from the University of Colorado Denver for her contributions to the Hispanic community and senior citizens. In December 2001 Archuleta was honored as one of Denver's \\"Unsung Heroes\\" by Mayor Wellington Webb. In April 2002 the Denver Public Library Association introduced the annual Lena L. Archuleta Community Service Award, with Archuleta being the first recipient. LARASA initiated its annual Lena L. Archuleta Education Service Award in 2004. In October 2002 the Denver Public Schools system dedicated the Lena L. Archuleta Elementary School in the northeast Denver neighborhood of Montbello in her honor. The school, built at a cost of $10.8 million and educating grades K-5, was the first Denver public school named for a Latina. Personal She married Juan U. Archuleta in 1943. After their move to Denver in 1951, he worked for the Denver Public Schools system in power and water system maintenance. They were married for 55 years at the time of Juan's death in 1998. They had no children. In 1999 Archuleta and five other women formed a Spanish-speaking widows support group at Centro San Juan Diego, the Hispanic ministry of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Denver. In 2004, the group created an annual awards brunch called the Las Madrinas Tribute, recognizing women who have made significant contributions to the community. An auction held at the brunch has been named the \\"Lena Archuleta Mercadito\\" in her memory. Archuleta's interests included piano playing and dance. She was a member of Las Estrellitas Alegres (The Happy Little Stars) women's Spanish and Mexican dance group in Denver. The Lena L. Archuleta Papers, covering her career from 1942 to 2010, are housed at the Denver Public Library.

The test can be used to diagnose platelet disorders, monitor antiplatelet therapy, and is also investigated as a potential predictor of transfusion requirements and bleeding risk in cardiac surgery. Instrument The Multiplate MEA Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics International Ltd) has 5 channels for simultaneous measurement of several samples or agonists. The instrument detects change in electrical impedance when platelets aggregate on metal electrodes in the test cuvette. Each cuvette contains two pairs of sensor electrodes, each of which measures the change in impedance. The duplicate sensors serve as an integrated quality control, and the analysis is accepted if the correlation coefficient of the measurements is greater than 0.98. The difference of each curve from the mean curve is also calculated, and a difference of less than 20% is accepted. The test cuvettes also contain a teflon coated magnetic stirring bar. The increase in impedance as aggregation occurs is transformed into aggregation units (AU) and plotted against time on the computer screen. Sample The manufacturer recommends the use of hirudin as anticoagulant for samples to be tested, but studies have shown that heparin is a good alternative. 300 ¬µL of blood is needed for each analysis, and is diluted with the same amount of saline. After pipetting blood and saline into the cuvette, the test is incubated for three minutes before the chosen agonist is added. The test is then started, and platelet aggregation is recorded at approximately 0.5 second intervals for six minutes. Three parameters are calculated: aggregation, velocity and area under the curve (AUC). Aggregation (in AU) is the maximum height of the aggregation curve, and velocity (in AU/min) is the maximum slope of the curve. AUC is the most important parameter. It is recorded in Units (U), and is affected by both the height and the slope of the aggregation curve, and is the best overall measure of platelet activity. Multiplate Tests/Reagents =ADPtest= Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is a platelet agonist. When it is added to saline-diluted whole blood in the test cuvette, it stimulates the ADP receptors on platelets, activating the platelets. The activation of the platelets leads to shape change and degranulation, and the released content of the granules further activates the platelets. Activation also induces a conformational change in the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) receptor, giving it high affinity for fibrinogen. Binding of fibrinogen to GPIIb/IIIa receptors leads to platelet- to-platelet bridges and results in platelet aggregation. Antiplatelet drugs like clopidogrel and prasugrel irreversibly inhibit the ADP receptor P2Y12, leading to a decreased ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Drugs that inhibit the GPIIb/IIIa receptor, e.g. eptifibatide, can also reduce or eliminate the ADP-induced platelet response. =ASPItest= In the ASPItest arachidonic acid is added to the saline-diluted blood sample. Arachidonic acid is converted to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) by cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1), and PGH2 is then converted to thromboxane A2 (TXA2) by thromboxane synthase. TXA2 increases platelet aggregation, promotes degranulation and stimulates platelet activation. Inhibition of COX1, as with acetylsalicylic acid, and inhibition or absence of GPIIb/IIIa receptor, as seen in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, will reduce platelet aggregation in response to arachidonic acid. =COLtest= Collagen is added to the sample-saline mix, and binds to collagen-receptors on platelets. This leads to a release of arachidonic acid, which is converted to the potent platelet activator TXA2. COLtest is sensitive to inhibition of COX1 and GPIIb/IIIa and to Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. =RISTOtest= Ristocetin forms complexes with von Willebrand factor (vWF) that bind to the glycoprotein Ib (GP1b) receptors on platelets, causing platelet activation and aggregation. Reduced or absent aggregation in response to ristocetin can be caused by a lack of or reduction of vWF, as seen in von Willebrand disease (vWD), or absence or reduction in numbers of GP1b receptors, as in Bernard‚ÄìSoulier syndrome (BSS). RISTOtest can be performed in two concentrations; RISTOhigh and RISTOlow. In RISTOhigh, a ristocetin concentration of 0,77 mg/ml is applied. This normally induces a strong platelet aggregation, and low or absent aggregation can be caused by the earlier mentioned conditions vWD and BSS. In RISTOlow, the ristocetin concentration is just 0,2 mg/ml, and at a level that does not normally induce a strong aggregation response. This test can detect if vWF shows a stronger than normal tendency to aggregate platelets, which can be seen in a subtype of vWD called vWDIIb. =TRAPtest= Thrombin receptor activating peptide-6 (TRAP-6) activates platelets through the thrombin receptor protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1). Binding of TRAP-6 to PAR-1 causes a conformational change in the GPIIb/IIIa receptors on platelets, giving them high affinity for fibrinogen. Fibrinogen then binds to the receptors, crosslinking several platelets and causing aggregation. Aggregation in TRAPtest may be reduced or absent in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, where GPIIb/IIIa receptors are few or absent, or if the patient is taking a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist. Traptest has only minor sensitivity for inhibition of COX1 and ADP-receptors. =ASA Reagent= Adding ASA (acetylsalicylic acid) reagent to a blood sample reduces the aggregation responses in ASPItest and COLtest. ASA irreversibly inhibits COX1 in platelets, thereby inhibiting the production of TXA2. The ASA Reagent is used as a quality control in the platelet function testing with Multiplate, allowing the assessment of abnormal platelet responses in ASPItest and COLtest. =GPIIb/IIIa Antagonist Reagent= This reagent is used as a quality control in Multiplate platelet function testing. The GPIIb/IIIa antagonist blocks the binding of fibrinogen to the GPIIb/IIIa receptors, preventing the formation of platelet-fibrinogen bonds and resulting in significantly reduced platelet aggregation in response to all agonists. The antagonist reagent is used together with TRAP-test, and allows assessment of a positive control. =Prostaglandin E1 Reagent= Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is a platelet inhibitor that causes an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in platelets by stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity. cAMP is an intracellular signaling molecule, and the increase in cAMP inhibits calcium mobilization and platelet aggregation induced by activation of the ADP receptor P2Y1. Activation of the P2Y1 receptor initiates platelet aggregation in response to ADP. The P2Y1 receptor is required for ADP-induced platelet activation, but is not sufficient for a full platelet aggregation in response to ADP. cAMP inhibits platelet aggregation, and decreased amounts of cAMP in platelets lead to platelet aggregation. The PGE1 reagent is used together with the ADP test for two purposes: the assessment of ADP high sensitivity (HS) and of positive controls of the ADPtest. When a small amount of PGE1 (20 ¬µl) is added to the ADPtest, it induces a moderat inhibition of aggregation in normal samples, but greatly increases the sensitivity of platelets to inhibition by clopidogrel. This is why the modified test is called \\"High Sensitivity\\". Adding 50 ¬µl of PGE1 to the ADPtest leads to a strong inhibition of ADP induced aggregation, and is used for assessment of positive controls of the ADPtest.

Early life and career  Dmitri Kogan was born in Moscow, USSR, into a famous musical dynasty. His grandfather, Leonid Kogan, was an outstanding violinist, his grandmother, Elizabeth Gilels ‚Äì a famous violinist and a teacher, his father, Pavel Kogan, is a conductor, and his mother, Lyubov Kazinskaya, ‚Äì a pianist who graduated from the Gnessin Russian Academy of Music. He began playing the violin at the age of 6 at the Central Music School of the Moscow State P.I. Tchaikovsky Conservatory. From 1996 to 1999 Kogan was a student at the Moscow Conservatory (the class of I.S. Bezrodny) and almost at the same time (1996‚Äì2000) he was a student at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, Finland, studying with I.S. Bezrodny and Tuomas Haapanen. At the age of 10 Dmitri performed for the first time accompanied by a symphony orchestra, and when he was 15 he played with an orchestra in the Grand Hall of the Moscow Conservatory.  Performance career  Kogan made his debut in Great Britain and the US in 1997. He regularly performed at the most prestigious concert halls of Europe, Asia, America, Australia, Middle East, the CIS and the Baltic countries. Kogan participated at many prestigious music festivals around the world, such as the Corinthian Summer Festival (Austria), Menton Music Festival (France), Montreux Jazz Festival (Switzerland), and Perth Festival (Scotland). He also participated in the Chereshnevy Les Open-Art Festival, Russian Winter (Russkaya Zima) Festival, Music Kremlin Festival, Andrey Sakharov International Art Festival and many others in places like Athens, Vilnius, Shanghai, Ogden, Utah and Helsinki. Niccol√≤ Paganini's cycle of 24 caprices, long considered impossible to perform, held a special place in Kogan's repertoire, which consisted mostly of great concertos for violin and orchestra. Only a few select violinists are capable of performing the whole cycle. On April 19, 2009, Kogan was the first violinist to play a concert for explorers at the North Pole. On January 15, 2010, Kogan was awarded the honorary title of Honoured Artist of the Russian Federation. The Kogan Fund for Support of Outstanding Cultural Projects was created in April 2011 by Kogan and a patron of arts, Chair of the AVS-group Holding Company, Valery Saveliev. The public phase of the first project promoted by the Fund was Kogan's concert in the Pillar Hall of the House of the Unions on May 26, 2011. He played five violins by Stradivari, Guarneri, Amati, Guadagnini and Vuillaume. He continued the show, \\"Five Great Violins in One Concert\\", at the top concert venues in Russia and abroad. In January 2013, he performed it at the World Economic Forum in Davos in the presence of the Prime-Minister of Russia Dmitri Medvedev and representatives of the world's political and business elites. The Robrecht violin, created in 1728 by Bartolomeo Giuseppe Antonio Guarneri (delGes√π), a renowned luthier of Cremona, was purchased by the Fund and presented to Kogan in Milan on September 1, 2011. In 2015, Kogan presented a new project, accompanying his performance of The Four Seasons by Vivaldi and Astor Piazzolla with video projection. Kogan released ten CDs in collaboration with Delos, Conforza, DV Classics and other record labels.  Social and charity activities  Kogan dedicated great effort to charity and supported campaigns for children and youth. In December 2002 the First Leonid Kogan International Festival took place with Dmitri being its organizer and artistic director. Kogan was the founder and artistic director of the Annual International Days of High Music Festival that takes place in Vladivostok and since 2005 it has been also held on Sakhalin. From 2004 to 2005 Kogan was the general artistic director of Primorsk State Philharmonic Society. From September 2005 he was the chairman of the board of Regents of Sakhalin State Philharmonic Society. In December 2007 Kogan founded and became the Head of the International Kogan Festival in Yekaterinburg. In August 2010 he was elected as an Honorary Professor of the Athens Conservatoire. He held the post of Artistic Director at the Samara State Philharmonic Hall in the period from 2011 to 2013. In October 2010 Kogan became the chairman of the board of Regents of the Ural Music College. The Kogan Fund for Support of Outstanding Cultural Projects was created in April 2011 thanks to efforts of Kogan and a patron of arts, Chair of the AVS-group Holding Company, Valery Saveliev. The main goal of the Fund is the continued development of the world class charity and art patronage traditions of Russia. The Fund intends to search for unique musical instruments and to have them restored by the best art conservators and then to hand them over to professional musicians. Further, the Fund plans to help meet theneeds of musical schools and colleges, to find and support young talents. Kogan was an Adviser on Cultural Affairs to the Governor of Chelyabinsk Oblast from 2011 to 2014. In April 2012 Kogan chaired the board of regents at the Urals Mussorgsky State Conservatoire together with Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk. In March 2012 Kogan became a confidant of Vladimir Putin, the President of the Russian Federation. Kogan wss an honorary professor of the Athens Conservatoire and the Urals State Conservatoire, Ulyanovsk State University, and chairman of the board of Regents of the Ural Musical College. From April 2013 onwards he chaired the International Musical Kremlin Festival that was founded by Nikolay Petrov, a prominent Russian pianist and Kogan's friend and mentor. From June 2013 he was an advisor on Cultural Affairs to the Governor of Vladimir Oblast. In February 2014 Kogan was appointed Artistic Director of one of Moscow's leading musical collectives ‚Äì the Moscow Camerata Chamber Orchestra. In September 2014 the maestro was an Artistic Director of the First Arctic Classical Music Fest in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug. In September 2014 he was appointed as the Counsellor for Cultural Affairs to the Governor of the Nenets Autonomous Okrug.

History CIFE Rohtak is the only central research centre in India dedicated to research on use of inland saline soils and ground water for fish and shrimp culture (Inland saline aquaculture). Traditionally a non fish growing state, CIFE pioneered scientific fish farming in Haryana after successful pilot studies and demonstrations at Dumduma and Sultanpur farm in Gurgaon District, Haryana beginning as early as 1980. In order to further strengthen research in Inland saline aquaculture, CIFE shifted its research centre from Sultanpur to what was then the National seed farm facility under state fisheries department near Rohtak (Lahli-Baiyani Villages) in April 1996. Location ICAR-CIFE Rohtak centre is located in Lahli Village, Rohtak, Haryana. The centre is located about 15 km from Rohtak city on Rohtak ‚Äì Bhiwani road. Facilities This research center has a total farm area of 32 acres. It has two farms i.e., Baniyani farm dedicated towards high inland saline aquaculture research activities and Lahli farm where low inland saline aquaculture research activities are performed. The Center has a soil and water testing lab facility, scampi (giant freshwater prawn) hatchery with the seed production capacity of 5.0 million post larvae annually and a wet laboratory to conduct indoor experiments.

Then in 2014, 3 farmers of Haryana adopted Pacific white shrimp culture technology in inland saline waters in a total area of about 12 acres. In 2015, about 25 farmers took up the technology in a total area of about 75 acres. This technology has widely reached among the farmers and more and more farmers are showing interest to adopt this technology.

Built in the 1930s, it was the town's first high school, serving as first a high school, and later as a junior high school and elementary school, until its closure in 2011. The building has been converted to residential use. Description and history The former Plummer-Motz Schools is located south of Falmouth's town center, at the southwest corner of Middle and Lunt Roads. The Plummer School building, originally the high school, is the more northerly part of the complex. It is a two-story Colonial Revival masonry building, with a central portion flanked by projecting wings. It is covered by a dormered gambrel roof with shingled ends and dormers, with a cupola at the center. It was at one time joined by a hyphen to the adjacent Motz School, a pair of single-story gable-roofed buildings. The hyphen was removed in 2014, when the town divided the property and sold the Plummer School building. Prior to construction of the Plummer School, Falmouth's high school students were educated by arrangement in the schools of adjacent towns. Need for a town high school was identified in 1928, and the central portion and one wing of the Plummer School building were constructed in 1931, to a design by Portland architect John P. Thomas. The second wing was added in 1936 when additional financing was made available. The town continued to grow rapidly over the following decades, resulting the construction of the adjacent school buildings and the eventual conversion of this building to a junior high school. In 1965 the combined Plummer and Motz buildings were converted into an elementary school, a use that continued until 2011. The town in 2013 sold the Plummer School to a developer, who converted it to residential housing.

The bounded locality of Bundey corresponds to the boundaries of the cadastral Hundred of Bundey, except for the southwestern corner of the Hundred which is the northeastern corner of the locality of Geranium Plains. Bundey was named in 1878 for politician William Henry Bundey. The area was originally the territory of the Ngadjuri people. Following European settlement, it was surveyed into 500 acre blocks and taken up by farmers in 1879. Bundey Post Office opened on 1 May 1882 and closed on 1 October 1901. Bundey Immanuel Lutheran Church was established in 1889. The first building was pug and daub. After storm damage, a more substantial building of limestone and bricks replaced it in either 1900 or 1905. The church building also served as a school during the week, with lessons in a mixture of German and English, until its forced closure by the state government in 1917. The church itself closed in January 1925, and the building is now an abandoned ruin.

He has lived and worked in New York since 1988.  Biography  Pagk was born in 1962 of a Czech father and an English mother, who was also a painter and with whom he visited museums as a child. He studied at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris (France) from 1978 until 1982,Biography and Publications, Galerie Eric Dupont, accessed 18/02/2016 at: http://www.eric- dupont.com/biography/id_8/Paul-PagkBiography, Thomas Erben Gallery, accessed 18/02/2016 at:http://www.thomaserben.com/artists/pagk/exh.html year in which he founded the ¬´ 55 rue des Panoyaux ¬ª space in M√©nilmontant (Paris) - a working space for artists located in an old foundry. One year later he met the French gallerist Jean Fournier who became one of his first collectors. In 1984, he exhibited at the galerie Jean Fournier in Paris and at the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs. In 1987, he had his first solo-show at the galerie Jean Fournier, and exhibited also at the art center Cr√©dac in Ivry (France) and at the Parc Floral of Paris. That same year, he was awarded the Prix F√©n√©on (Sorbonne University, Paris). In September 1988, he moved to New York where he had found an artist loft to rent, and what was supposed to be a one-year stay became a long-term one in New York. That year, he discovered the triple exhibition of Blinky Palermo, Imi Knoebel and Joseph Beuys at the Dia Art Foundation in Chelsea (New York), which had an important impact on his work.Biography, Paul Pagk blog accessed 18/02/2016 at: http://paulpagkbio.blogspot.fr In 1990, he was included in the exhibition ‚ÄúThree Painters‚Äù curated by Tim Nye in Soho (New York), which included also American artist Jacqueline Humphries and Corean artist Huyn Soo Choi. In 1991, Tim Nye opened a non-profit space ‚ÄúThread Waxing Space‚Äù in Soho with Paul Pagk‚Äôs first solo show in New York. In 1993, the second solo show of Paul Pagk at Thread Waxing Space was accompanied by a catalogue with a discussion between Tim Nye and Paul Pagk. The show received a lot of attention from public and media. Since then, his work is regularly exhibited in France, United States and Europe. He received several awards: Prix F√©n√©on (1987), Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant (1998), Sheldon Bergh Prize (2000), Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation Grant (2012), Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant (2012), and Joan Mitchell Foundation Painters & Sculptors Grant (2014).  Work  In a catalogue essay entitled, \\"The pleasure principle\\" published in 1999 for Paul Pagk's show at art center Le10neuf du CRAC in Montbeliard (France), American art curator Franklin Sirmans said \\"His heavily build up surfaces (Pagk often works on a single painting for three months) reemphasize the quality of the paint itself, and serve to expand the parameters of the visual space... It is also the visual density of the paint that is reminiscent of spirituality in a way that references the baroque quality of early Dutch painting...What strikes me after continually encountering his paintings over the last couple of years is the earnestness of the artist's endeavor which actually takes you on an art historical ride from Russian Constructivists like Malevich, to the deductive abstractions of Reinhardt and Newman in the 50s, to the conceptually-influenced monochromes of Ryman. While these canonical references allow the viewer to connect the dots in a fashion suggestive of thematic painting, that is not necessarily the case. The artist's style is thoroughly unique avoiding any burdensome odes to modernist or postmodernist longing.\\" When reviewing Paul Pagk's show in 1993 (Artforum International), art critic Donald Kuspit said, \\"Paul Pagk's abstract paintings show that the renewal of painting depends upon the renewal of what is fundamental to it: primitive sensory experience articulated through texture and elementary structure. The former is innate to surface, the latter marks it as the universal ground of presentation.\\"  (Selection)  *2016 - Paul Pagk, Galerie Eric Dupont, Paris, FranceExhibitions, Galerie Eric Dupont site accessed 18/02/2016 at: http://www.eric-dupont.com/exhibitionsGalerie Eric Dupont exposition solo ouvrant Janvier 9th, Artist's site accessed 18/02/2016 at: http://paulpagk.blogspot.fr/2015/12/galerie-eric-dupont-exposition- solo.htmlPaul Pagk, Art press site accessed 18/02/2016 at: http://www.artpress.com/2016/02/04/paul-pagk/ *2015 - ON PAPER Mamie Holst and Paul Pagk, presented by Jane Kim, 33 Orchard, New York City, USAExhibition review: Paul Pagk, Magenta Magazine site accessed 18/02/2016 at: http://www.magentafoundation.org/magazine/paul-pagk/ON PAPER: Mamie Holst & Paul Pagk, January 15 - March 8, 2015 site accessed 18/02/2016 at: http://33orchard.com/2015/01/05/on-paper-mamie-holst-paul-pagk- january-15-february-22-2015/ *2014 - ≈íuvres r√©centes, Galerie Eric Dupont, Paris, FranceOur Secret: Hidden Master Painter Paul Pagk, Art critical site accessed 18/02/2016 at: http://www.artcritical.com/2014/09/22/adrian-dannatt- on-paul-pagk/Paul Pagk, vivacit√© de l'abstraction, Art press site accessed 18/02/2016 at: http://www.artpress.com/2014/10/29/paul-pagk-vivacite-de- labstraction/ *2014 - Material Way, curated by Kathleen Kucka, Shirley Fitterman Art Gallery BMCC, New York City, USA *2014 - (S)ITATIONS La beaut√© devient avant-garde une passion priv√©e, Mus√©e de Sarrebourg, Sarrebourg, France *2014 - Summer Show, Focus on Painting, FL Gallery, Milan, Italie *2014 - Brooklyn Bridge, curated by Justine Frischmann, George Lawson Gallery, San Francisco, CA, USA * 2013 - 18 Drawings and 1 Painting, Studio 10, Brooklyn, New York, USAPaul Pagk: 18 Drawings and 1 Painting, Arts in Bushwick site accessed 18/02/2016 at: http://artsinbushwick.org/2013/04/22/paul- pagk-18-drawings-and-1-painting/ * 2013 - Come Together: Surviving Sandy, Year 1, curated by Phong Bui, Dedalus foundation, Brooklyn, USA * 2013 - La main invente le dessin, Centre culturel de rencontre, Abbaye de Saint-Riquier, France * 2013 - Four Tet, JiM Comtempori, Barcelone, Espagne * 2013 - Emergence, A Proposition by: Katrin Bremermann, Erin Lawlor & Yifat Gat, H√¥tel de Sauroy, Paris, France * 2013 - Wit, curated by Joanne Freeman, Painting Center, New York, USA * 2012 - Around the corner, Four Painters Living in Tribeca: Hermine Ford, Joanne Greenbaum, Paul Pagk, Gary Stephan, organized by Lucien Terras, New York, USA * 2012 - Line and Plane, McKenzie Fine Art, New York City, USA * 2012 - Surface Affect, Miguel Abreu Gallery, New York City, USA\\"Surface Affect\\" at Miguel Abreu, Contemporary Art Daily site accessed 18/02/2016 at: http://www.contemporaryartdaily.com/2012/06/surface-affect-at- miguel-abreu-2/ppagk_minuitfugue_2011_12_76x74in_pp1005/ * 2011 - Mesquite drawings, Some Walls, Oakland, CA, USAPaul Pagk, Some walls site accessed 18/02/2016 at: http://somewalls.com/paul-pagk/ * 2011 - A Review, Edward Thorp Gallery, New York, USA * 2011 - 70 Years of Abstract Painting ‚Äì Excerpts, Jason McCoy inc.

The main goal of this offensive was to capture the strategic city of Al-Shaddadi and the remainder of the southern al-Hasakah Governorate from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). During the offensive, the US-led coalition conducted more than 86 airstrikes in Al- Shaddadi and the nearby areas, in support of the SDF advances.27 (Feb. 13‚Äì19) + 59 (Feb. 20‚Äì26) = 86 airstrikes (Feb. 13‚Äì26) Background On 31 October 2015, the SDF launched an offensive to capture the town of al-Hawl and the surrounding countryside from ISIL. On 13 November, the SDF captured al-Hawl and the al-Hawl Refugee Camp, along with the areas to the east and south of the town, and on 16 November, the SDF captured a pocket of ISIL territory to the northwest of al-Hawl. On 22 November, the SDF captured the town of Kama'il, the Regiment 121 base, and the surrounding area. By 30 November, the SDF had captured the South Hasakah Dam and the village of Qana, coming within of Al-Shaddadi from both the north and northeast. During the al-Hawl offensive, the SDF captured 1,400 square kilometers (870 square miles) of land, including more than 240 towns and villages. By 23 December, the SDF had captured the town of Al-Arishah. On the same day, the SDF repelled a pro-Assad militia attack on their positions in the town. The offensive On 16 February 2016, the SDF launched an offensive to capture the strategic city of al-Shaddadi and the surrounding countryside, with a force of about 6,000 fighters. SDF forces attacked mainly from two axes, from the Abdul al-Aziz Mountains and from the al-Hawl area, advancing towards Shaddadi from the northwest and the northeast. On 18 February, the SDF captured at least eight villages and two other areas, including the villages of Mashtal and Mishwar, to the southwest of Al-Hawl. On the same day, the SDF also captured the Jabisah and Kabibah oil fields, both to the northeast of Al-Shaddadi. By this time, SDF forces had captured 48 villages and hamlets since the start of the offensive. At least 49 ISIL militants were killed, and another dozen were wounded in the clashes. 38 civilians were killed by US-led coalition airstrikes. On 19 February 2016, the SDF cut off the al-Shaddadi‚Äìal-Baaj road, capturing multiple villages in the process, including: Dilan, Simalka, Ballouna, Dabshi, Meshal, Mashwar, Khirba, Givara, Umm Tanak, Umm Bouja, and Misherfa. On the same day, the SDF reached the northeastern entrance of Al- Shaddadi, and they also advanced within 3 kilometers of Al-Shaddadi's northwestern outskirts, capturing the town of Sabaa. SDF forces also captured another 47 villages around Al-Shaddadi, and fully besieged the city. This also trapped many ISIL fighters in a pocket of villages between Al-Arishah and Al- Shaddadi. Later on 19 February, al-Shaddadi was captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces, A US-led coalition airstrike also killed several high- ranking ISIL leaders in Al-Shaddadi on 19 February. On the same day, a YPG position to the east of Al-Hasakah was bombed by an unidentified jet, killing three YPG fighters and wounding two others. On 20 February, the SDF advanced further south of al-Shaddadi and captured the village of al-Alwa, as well as the town of al-Fadghami. SDF forces also captured 12 farms and villages during this advance. This left Markada as the last town controlled by ISIL in the Al- Hasakah Governorate. On the same day, the SDF celebrated capturing Al-Shaddadi from ISIL. On 21 February, violent clashes erupted, after ISIL attempted to infiltrate an area in the al-Shaddadi countryside. On the same day, SDF forces advanced further southward, coming within 16 kilometers (10 miles) of the Deir ez-Zor Governorate. A pro-Kurdish source claimed the SDF also reportedly captured the town of Markada, although this was not independently confirmed. At least 64 ISIL militants were killed in the clashes. It was also reported that the SDF found and eliminated three separate groups of ISIL militants that were hiding in Al-Shaddadi city, and that ISIL was sending reinforcements from the Deir ez-Zor Governorate to prevent further SDF advances. Later on the same day, the SDF released an operations statement sheet, declaring that they had liberated 2,400 square kilometers (1,491 square miles) of land from ISIL forces. The SDF began cleanup operations to remove the mines and booby traps left behind by ISIL, and to sweep the countryside for any remaining ISIL militants. Late on 21 February, ISIL forces launched a counterattack, in an attempt to recapture the city, re-entering Al-Shaddadi's western and southern suburbs, and recapturing the town of Sabaa. However, SDF forces managed to repel the attack and recaptured Sabaa; 11 SDF fighters and seven ISIL militants were reported killed in the clashes. Afterwards, SDF fighters began fortifying Al-Shaddadi, to protect against future attacks. The SDF also stated that they would never give up control of the city to ISIL, and that they would work to push ISIL out of the entire Al-Hasakah Province and keep them from returning. Early on 22 February, ISIL launched another counterattack on Al- Shaddadi's southern outskirts, resulting in additional clashes, before they were repelled by the SDF once again. Early on 23 February, SDF forces recaptured the Jabisah oil field, following an earlier ISIL counterattack. Clashes also erupted to the south of Al-Shaddadi. On 23 February, ISIL also released the last 42 Assyrian Christian hostages that they had captured from the Khabur Valley region, during a previous offensive in February 2015. It was also reported that half of Al-Shaddadi had been cleared of the bombs left behind by ISIL. Later on the same day, ISIL's forces in the southern countryside of Al-Shaddadi were reported to have collapsed and retreated back to the Markada District. Early on 24 February, the SOHR reported that two more civilians had been killed by US-led coalition airstrikes near Al-Shaddadi, while clashes continued south of Al-Shaddadi. Additionally, four YPG fighters, one of them a German volunteer, were killed in the Al-Shaddadi countryside during clashes with ISIL. Later on the same day, it was reported that 120 ISIL militants had been found and killed, during a clearing operation in a village south of Al-Shaddadi. Late on 24 February, it was reported that the SDF had ended their offensive operations, after they completely secured and demined the city of Al-Shaddadi, along with the surrounding countryside, including the pocket between Al-Arishah and Al-Shaddadi. By the end of the offensive, the SDF had captured 315+ villages and 2,400+ square kilometers (1,491+ square miles) of land from ISIL. It was later revealed that during the offensive, a small number of US commanders had traveled to the frontlines to help advise SDF forces, and to coordinate airstrikes. Strategic analysis The capture of al-Shaddadi left the ISIL capital city of Raqqa as the only major ISIL stronghold near SDF-held territories in northeastern Syria. The capture of al- Shaddadi was considered to be a major victory for the SDF and the US-led Coalition, because Al-Shaddadi was the city from which ISIL had planned all of its attacks on Kurdish-held territories in the Al-Hasakah Province, and because Al-Shaddadi was also the last major hub on the Syrian side of the Mosul-Raqqa route, following the capture of al-Hawl. Although the SDF managed to sever another key supply route between Raqqa and Mosul, Coalition Spokesman Col. Christopher Garver noted that ISIL could still switch to using multiple other goat trails and desert roads, even though those routes would be much harder to navigate. ISIL's sudden collapse in al-Shaddadi was described as \\"swift and surprising,\\" and the withdrawal was thought to be due to ISIL's tactical reasoning or an attempt to alarm Turkey with rapid Kurdish advances. In late March 2016, US officials revealed that the Al-Shaddadi offensive had originally been planned as a 6-week-long operation, but instead, ISIL forces there collapsed within days. Aftermath On 1 August 2016, a motorcycle bomb blew up at an Internet caf√© in Shaddadi, killing at least 4 civilians. On 26 August, ISIL forces launched a counterattack on the southern Shaddadi countryside after shelling and detonating 2 car bombs at SDF positions, reportedly capturing 3 villages in the area. ISIL conducted another attack on the city's suburbs on 11 September, but the attack was repelled by the SDF.

Established in 2006, the JGH is printed and published online by Cambridge University Press. The goal of the journal is to discuss interdisciplinary topics and new methodological modes of analysis concerning the study of the past over time and space. The current editors-in-chief of the journal are William Gervase Clarence-Smith, SOAS, University of London and Ewout Frankema, Wageningen University. History Early ideas for a journal of global history began at the Institute of Historical Research when the Director Patrick K. O'Brien, professor of global history, created a new seminar in 1990. And in 2003, the Global Economic History Network connected 49 historians to discuss the history of globalization. A subsequent graduate degree was created at the London School of Economics that focused on \\"meta-narratives in history\\", focusing on environments, geopolitics, religions, cultures, economies, gender, ideas, and science. Five years after the degree was launched, the London School of Economics and Cambridge University Press co-sponsored The Journal of Global History. The JGH featured an essay by Professor O'Brien entitled \\"Historiographical traditions and modern imperatives for the restoration of global history\\". Since then, the journal has grown significantly and spearheaded a new movement of global history in the academic discipline. O'Brien notes that the two fundamentals of studying the world are connections and comparisons. The JGH aims to address the main problems of studying global change over time, transcending standard regional boundaries. Popular topics for the journal include globalization, comparative history, and cross-border history. Articles are meant to engage in interdisciplinary debates among historians sociologists, economists, and political scientists, as well as specialists in non-written histories, such as geographers, archaeologists, and biologists. Alongside the journal's founding, global history thus began to emerge as a discipline after the publication of Pamela Kyle Crossley's What is Global History? (Cambridge, 2008) and Sebastian Conrad's What is Global History? (Princeton, 2016). The journal has also been strongly influenced by the publication of Kenneth Pomeranz' The Great Divergence: China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy (Princeton, 2000). Indexing It is indexed by Index Islamicus, Academic Search Premier, RePEC and the European Reference Index for the Humanities and Social Sciences (ERIH PLUS). The current impact factor of the journal is 0.625 according to Thomson Reuters, making the journal the fourth most cited history journal in the world.

Life Giorgios Gounaropoulos was born in Sozopol, Bulgaria, on 22 March 1890, the sixth child of a Greek family. In the early 1900s the Bulgarian government put pressure on Greek-origin families in the country to adopt the Bulgarian national identity. The family decided to move to Greece, and in 1904 settled in Athens. From 1907 to 1912 Gounaropoulos studied at the Athens School of Fine Arts under Spyros Vikatos, Dimitrios Geraniotis, Georgios Roilos and Georgios Jakobides. He was awarded an Averoff scholarship, and after World War II (1914‚Äì18) he went to Paris in 1919 and attended the Acad√©mie Julian and the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re. While in Paris he participated in Salons, and held his first solo exhibition at the Vavin- Raspail Gallery in 1926. Gounaropoulos staged his first exhibition in Athens in 1924 and a controversial solo exhibition at the Stratigopoulos gallery in 1929. He returned to Athens permanently in 1931. He continued to exhibit in solo and group shows, including international shows in S√£o Paulo in 1959 and Alexandria in 1963. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1958. He died in 1977. Work Gounaropoulos began painting in academic style, then was influenced by impressionism and Paul C√©zanne, and eventually developed a very personal surrealistic style. His paintings have a dreamy and lyrical quality inspired by ancient Greek art. He illustrated collections of poetry, made wall paintings for the Municipal Council of Athens (1937‚Äì39) and painted the iconography for the chapel of the Public Hospital of Volos (1951). His home was donated by his family to become the home of the Gounaropoulos Museum in 1979. Examples of his work are also held by the Municipal Art Gallery of Ioannina.

Centered at the junction of Dorset West Road and Nichols Hill Road, the area is also historically significant as the site in 1775 of the first meetings that culminated in Vermont's period of independence prior to become the 14th United States state. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history The Kent Neighborhood is located in western Dorset, south of the main village. It extends along Lane Road to Dorset West Road, and then further westward along Nichols Hill Road. The district is entirely residential, with dispersed houses along the three roads. All are clapboarded wood frame buildings, and most are stylistically vernacular interpretations of Federal period architecture. The oldest house dates to about 1783, and there are four non-historic 20th century houses interspersed among the older ones, which were typically built before 1850. One of the houses is a former one-room schoolhouse, built in about 1834, and another is notable as the home of George Holley, a leading figure in the development of the area's marble quarries. One of the area's early settlers was Cephas Kent, Sr., who moved to the area in 1773 and built a house and tavern. Neither still stands, but it was at Kent's tavern that a series of meetings took place in 1775, when the settlers of the area that is now Vermont, disputed between New York and New Hampshire, negotiated a set of agreements among themselves that resulted in the founding in 1777 of the independent Vermont Republic. The site of the Kent Tavern is marked by a marble memorial, placed in 1912. Many of the older houses in the area were built by members of the extended Kent family.

Serbian king Stefan Nemanja conquered the region from Byzantium in 1190, along with the cities Skadar and Bar. Later conquests by King Milutin and Emperor Stefan Du≈°an pushed the border further east and south, and Pilot remained within the Serbian empire until its fall in 1355 and the Ottoman conquest of Albania. Saint Sava and later sources distinguish an Upper and a Lower Pilot, separated by the Nd√´rmajna mountain. The name stems from (\\"land of palaces\\"), a Greek Orthodox suffragan diocese of Dyrrhachion in the 9th century. In the 11th century, the Roman Catholic diocese of Polatum appears as a suffragan of Bar. When the Serbian Orthodox Church became autocephalous in 1219, Pilot was divided into the Serbian dioceses Budimlje, Zeta, Hvosno and Prizren. In the 14th century, the Roman Catholic diocese Polatum was divided into Polatum maior, having its seat in the Benedictine monastery of St Paul de Polato, and Polatum minor around Sarda. From the 15th century onwards, members of the Dushmani appear as Catholic bishops. Illyricum sacrum (VII, 261-262) lists the following pagi as belonging to the Roman Catholic diocese of Polatum: * Polatum superior (northern part):  Vlachia (Blachia)  Salza  Toplana  Dushmani (Ducsman) * Polatum inferior (southern part):  Shalla (Scialla)  Shoshi (Sciosci)  Kjiri [Kiri] (Kivi, Chivi)  Planti  Dju√°nni [Xhani] (Gioagni) The Serbian monasteries Hilandar, Deƒçani, and Prizren owned extensive estates (metochions) in Pilot. In the 14th century, the area was ripe with orthodox priests. Russian ambassador and historian Ivan Jastrebov (1839‚Äì1894) identified Pilot as the Dukagjin highlands.

The place is today flooded by the Lake Nasser. In ancient times it was an important town and called Miam. The region around the town was one of the most fertile in Lower Nubia.Torgny S√§ve- S√∂derbergh: Aniba, in: Wolfgang Helck, Eberhard Otto (editors), Lexikon der √Ñgyptologie, I. Wiesbaden 1975, , p. 272 Earliest remains at Aniba date around 3000 BC and belong to the A-Group culture. A few cemeteries belonging to them were found. In the Middle Kingdom (about 2000 to 1700 BC) the region was ruled by Egyptians and in the Twelfth Dynasty there was built a fortress with a small town. At the beginning of the New Kingdom (about 1550 BC) the town was extended and was about 200 x 400 m big, with a wall and gates. During the New Kingdom the town grew and had several suburbs. Within the town proper stood the temple for Horus of Miam. When excavated it was only badly preserved but might be a foundation of the Middle Kingdom. North of the town there still stood a Nubian village belonging to the C-Group Culture. Around the town were huge cemeteries, some of them belonging to Nubians, but other tombs were erected in purely Egyptian style. It is not known for sure whether the people buried here were Nubians that adopted Egyptian culture or whether these were Egyptians. One rather simple tomb belonged to the Viceroy of Kush Pinehesy, an important person also known from other sources. There is even a decorated rock cut tomb belonging to the deputy of Lower Nubia Pennut. The latter office had most likely its headquarter in Aniba.Torgny S√§ve-S√∂derbergh: Aniba, in: Wolfgang Helck, Eberhard Otto (editors), Lexikon der √Ñgyptologie, I.

Production M√©li√®s appears in the film as the magician, with the actor Manuel as his assistant. Special effects in the film were created using stage machinery and substitution splices. The film includes magic tricks M√©li√®s had previously performed live on stage at his Paris theatre of illusions, the Th√©√¢tre Robert-Houdin: one in which giant playing-cards come from a display stand, and one in which a head comes out of a crate and chases the magician around the stage. (This latter stage illusion was created by M√©li√®s as \\"Le d√©capit√© recalcitrant\\" in 1891, with the head being that of a talkative pedant, Professor Barbenfouillis.) Release and survival The film was released in 1909 by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 1508‚Äì1512 in its catalogues. A surviving print of the film was rediscovered in the 1920s by Jean P. Mauclaire, director of the French art house cinema Studio 28. (The print was one of a batch of M√©li√®s films that had been owned by and shown at the Dufayel department store in Paris, and which had then been stored at the Ch√¢teau de Jeufosse in Normandy, where Mauclaire came across them.) Mauclaire exhibited the film as part of the Gala M√©li√®s at the Salle Pleyel on 16 December 1929. The surviving print of the film is hand-colored, but it is unclear when the coloring was done; the Gala M√©li√®s program identified the print as an original copy, but it is known that some prints shown at the Gala were hand-colored in 1929 specifically for that event. One legend claims that the 1929 coloring was done by Elisabeth Thuillier, an artist who had collaborated prolifically with M√©li√®s on film colorization at the turn of the century. However, this was disproved in an interview with Thuillier herself in the journal Le Nouvel Art Cin√©matographique (volume 5, January 1930, page 74).

He was the first holder of the Chair of Neurological Surgery at the University of Edinburgh. Life Norman Dott was born in Edinburgh on 26 August 1897, the third of the five children of Rebecca Morton (1864‚Äì1917) and Peter McOmish Dott (1856‚Äì1934), a picture dealer based at 127 George Street in Edinburgh's New Town.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1897-8 He was educated at George Heriot's School and originally intended a career in engineering. However a serious motorcycle accident on Lothian Road, hospitalised him and left him with a permanent leg injury (also rendering him unfit for service in the First World War). The long spell in hospital re-inspired Dott and he changed his ambition to focus upon medicine rather than engineering. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating M.B. in 1919 and gained a Ph.D. in 1922. In 1923 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. He then received a Rockefeller Travelling Scholarship, allowing him to travel to America to study further in Boston under Processor Harvey Williams Cushing. In 1932 he began lecturing at the University of Edinburgh, and in 1947 received the Professorship in Neuro-Surgery (one of the first in the world). Meanwhile, he also worked in Royal Hospital for Sick Children, and conducted private brain surgery from a premises in the New Town. In 1938 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Edwin Bramwell, Arthur Logan Turner, Anderson Gray McKendrick, and William Thomas Ritchie. During the Second World War he set up a specialist brain injuries unit at Bangour Hospital west of Edinburgh. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for this work in 1948. In 1960 he set up a Department of Neuro-Surgery at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, one of the first such facilities in the National Health Service. In 1962 he was made a Freeman of the City of Edinburgh. The University of Edinburgh awarded him an honorary doctorate (MD) in 1969. The Royal College of Surgeons of Canada made him an Honorary Fellow in 1973. He retired in 1963, his chair being filled by Professor Francis Gillingham. He died in Edinburgh on 10 December 1973. There‚Äôs a ward at The Walton Centre, Liverpool dedicated to his memory. Portraits of Dott are held at the National Galleries of Scotland (a photograph by Grace Alison) and at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (a painting by Sir William Hutchison). A biography of Dott was published in 1990 titled With Sharp Compassion. Family He married Margaret (\\"Peggy\\") Robertson in 1932. They had a daughter named Jean.  Family background  The Dott family - formerly D'Ott or possibly De Ott - were of Huguenot stock and had arrived in Scotland from the Low Countries in the late 17th century, when they settled at Cupar in Fife. Peter's father, Aitken Dott, had founded a picture-framing business in Edinburgh's South St David Street in 1842. In 1876 the young Peter Dott joined his father in the family business - later Aitken Dott & Sons - now removed to larger premises at Castle Street. Although she had been born at Birkenhead on Merseyside, Rebecca Dott's family were Ulster Scots. Having had a short-lived marriage in the 1880s, she had been a widow for several years when she married Peter Dott on 2 April 1894, at which time they settled in Colinton on the outskirts of Edinburgh.

In their plans, this league was meant to be in antithesis to the Wilsonian League of Nations, which was seen by many of Fiume's intellectuals as a mean to perpetuate a corrupt and imperialist status quo.Claudia Salaris, Alla festa della rivoluzione. Artisti e libertari con D'Annunzio a Fiume, Il Mulino, Bologna Gabriele D'Annunzio (in the middle with the stick) with some legionaries (components of the Arditi's department of the Italian Royal Army) in Fiume in 1919. To the right of D'Annunzio, facing him, Lt. Arturo Avolio (commander of the Ardit's department of Bologna Brigade). The organization was initially meant to help all oppressed nationalities in their struggle for political dignity and recognition, establishing links to many movements on various continents, but despite the links to various struggling groups across the international scene, it never found the necessary external support for success. Its most notable legacies remain today the Regency of Carnaro's recognition of the Soviet Union, first state entity in the world to have done so, as well as the recognition of the independence of the Irish Free State before the government of Great Britain had done so, mostly thanks to the pressures of minister Henry Furst.Renzo De Felice, D'Annunzio politico (1918-1928), Roma-Bari, Giuseppe Laterza e figli, 1978Enrico Galmozzi, \\"Il soggetto senza limite. Interpretazione del dannunzianesimo\\", Milano, 1994  Aims and aspirations  The project for the creation of a League of Oppressed Peoples had deep roots in D‚ÄôAnnunzio‚Äôs thought, for he had conceived of his Fiuman endeavor in \\"universal\\" terms almost from the beginning. The comandante was not content to see the scope of his action limited to the city of Fiume, and he had established contacts with other foreign movements very early on. The guiding spirit of the Lega di Fiume was L√©on Kochnitzky, the Belgian poet who had come to Fiume late in the fall of 1919, left the city during the crisis of December, and then returned in January to become the head of the Fiuman International Relations Bureau (Ufficio Relazioni Esteriori). This institution, acting with scarce finances and only a handful of employees, attempted to enlist the support of foreign movements ‚Äì and foreign powers ‚Äì in behalf of the Fiuman \\"cause\\". At first, Kochnitzky (with the assistance of Eugenio Coselschi, Ludovico Toeplitz, Giovanni Bonmartini, Henry Furst and others) was content to gather statements of support from the representatives of movements sympathetic to D‚ÄôAnnunzio. By early spring there was abundant evidence that an \\"anti-League of Nations\\" would be able to count upon a wide range of support, and Kochnitzky decided to request the creation of a formal organization. There was good reason to be optimistic about the league as one learns from a long series of memoranda that Kochnitzky prepared for D‚ÄôAnnunzio during the last week of March and the first half of April, listing the nations and movements that were either already committed to the project or that were expected to join the cause in short order.Michael Arthur Ledeen, D'Annunzio: The First Duce, The League of Fiume, Piscataway, Transaction Publishers, 2002, pp. 177-179 Kochnitzky saw the league as the vehicle for shattering the old order and establishing a world governed by the principles expounded in Italy and Life. It was, then, part of the sharp turn to the Left that characterized the policies of the Command during this period, and Kochnitzky significantly maintained that it was essential to acquire the support of the Soviet Union for the Lega. He considered this inevitable, claiming that Communist Russia, \\"like all spiritually alive elements of our time\\", could not fail to recognize the value of the new \\"International\\". Further, Kochnitzky urged D‚ÄôAnnunzio to support the Hungarian Communists and to issue an attack against Horthy‚Äôs regime. Such a stance would demonstrate the principles of \\"Fiumanism\\" upon which the new league would rest. Similarly, indicative of Kochnitzky‚Äôs conception of the Lega is a statement in a note to the commander on 29 March: \\"while the presence of representatives of the Montenegrin Court seems scarcely desirable in Fiume for various reasons, it would instead be useful if one or more leaders of the Montenegrin insurrection against Serbia attended.\\". Kochnitzky‚Äôs conception of the Lega di Fiume was in line with the design for the Republic of the Carnaro. Both committed the Command to an alliance with radical socialist forces, and both demonstrated D‚ÄôAnnunzio‚Äôs willingness to embrace the fundamental tenets of the European Left. Consequently, the plans for the league were subject to the same pressures as the planes for the Carta del Carnaro: as the internal position of Command was weakened by the attacks of the National Council, and when attempts to ally with Socialists failed (whether within Italy or on a European scale, as in the case of the talks with Vodovosoff), the project was threatened. Kochnitzky was aware of these problems, and explicitly linked the destiny of the league to the political situation in Fiume: ‚ÄúI know very well,‚Äù he told the commander on 29 March that \\"we can run into grave difficulties, given the internal situation in Fiume, and the numerous expulsions of the working-class elements...\\". The league was placed in serious jeopardy by the events of early April 1920, and by Easter, Kochnitzky‚Äôs messages to D‚ÄôAnnunzio were tinged with apprehension. On Easter Day he wrote: \\"I hope the League of Fiume will not give the world the grotesque spectacle of the 'League of Nations': impotence-indecision.\\" But the plans of the Belgian poet could not survive the shock of the first half of April, and the League of Fiume slowly disappeared, at least in the form Kochnitzky had conceived it.  Represented peoples  With genuinely global aspirations, the League of Fiume aimed to unite all of the following: I. ‚Äì Representatives of oppressed peoples: Fiume of Italy, the Islands, Dalmatia, Albania, German Austria, Montenegro, Croatia, German Irredentists now under Poland, Czecho-Slovakia, France and Italy (with reservations: autonomy) and the Pseudo-League of Nations, Catalonia, Malta, Gibraltar, Ireland, the Flemish.

Biography  The versatile intellectual was born in New York on October the 11th 1893 from a family of German origins. He spoke and wrote in English, Italian, French, German. He was a ferocious anti-fascist during the Italian two decades of fascist rule (but he was even a ‚Äúnostalgic‚Äù of Fascism after the fall), and a minister during the Italian Regency of Carnaro and had the merit of convincing Gabriele d'Annunzio to recognize the independence of the Irish Free State before any other nation. During the 1930s he worked as the Italian correspondent for The New York Times Book Review and as a partner of the literary journal L'Italiano. In this period, together with Indro Montanelli and Giovanni Ansaldo, he helped Leo Longanesi to establish the Longanesi publishing house and subsequently worked for Longanesi's periodical magazines Il Libraio and neo-fascist weekly newspaper Il Borghese. Married to writer Orsola Nemi (alias Flora Vezzani), in her partnership he became a prolific and versatile translator of German texts into Italian (Ernst J√ºnger, Franz Kafka, Werner Sombart), from Italian into English (Benedetto Croce) and in particular from English into Italian (Henry Miller, Saki, Robert Louis Stevenson, Edgar Allan Poe, Herman Melville, Charles Dickens).

The club also plays home games in Walkinstown. St Catherine's have been FAI Women's Cup finalists on three occasions, winning the competition in 2011. History St Catherine's was founded in 1980. Among the founder members was Brother Bernard Twomey, a member of the Order of Saint Augustine attached to St Catherine's Church. Brother Bernard later served the club as team manager. In 2001 St Catherine's played in their first FAI Women's Cup but lost to Shamrock Rovers. In the 2009 FAI Women's Cup, St Catherine's recorded victories over Galway, Lifford Ladies and the Cork Women's & Schoolgirls Soccer League before meeting St Francis in the final at Richmond Park. Katie Taylor was a member of the St Catherine's team this season but her boxing commitments sometimes restricted her appearances and she would miss the 2009 final. With a team that included Caroline Thorpe, St Catherine's lost 1‚Äì0 to a St Francis team that included Megan Campbell, Grainne Kierans and Mary Waldron. The 2011 FAI Women's Cup saw St Catherine's knockout both the Cork Women's & Schoolgirls Soccer League and Raheny United before defeating Kilmacrennan Celtic 7‚Äì0 in the semi-final. In the final played at Turners Cross they faced Wilton United. St Catherine's claimed the cup with a dramatic 3‚Äì1 victory. Mary Waldron, now playing for St Catherine's, scored the opening goal in the 43rd minute before Noelle Murray doubled the score in the 77th minute with an astonishing volley. However, Wilton hit back in the closing moments of the game through Denise O'Sullivan but their late comeback was short lived as Murray ended the contest with another impressive strike in the 89th minute. At the 2011‚Äì12 Women's National League Awards ceremony, Brother Bernard Twomey received the Services to Football Award. In addition to guiding St Catherine's to three FAI Women's Cup finals, Brother Bernard was recognised for dedicating his life to giving children the opportunity to play football at any level and for the important role he has played in the development of women's association football in the Republic of Ireland.

Mustard. 2006. Breccia dikes and crater-related faults in impact craters on Mars: Erosion and exposure on the floor of a crater 75 km in diameter at the dichotomy boundary, Meteorit. Planet Science: 41, 1675-1690. These features have also been called \\"polygonal ridge networks,\\" \\"boxwork ridges\\", and \\"reticulate ridges.\\"Moore, J., D. Wilhelms. 2001. Hellas as a possible site of ancient ice-covered lakes on Mars. Icarus: 154, 258-276. Ridges often appear as mostly straight segments that intersect in a lattice- like manner. They are hundreds of meters long, tens of meters high, and several meters wide. It is thought that impacts created fractures in the surface, these fractures later acted as channels for fluids. Fluids cemented the structures. With the passage of time, surrounding material was eroded away, thereby leaving hard ridges behind. It is reasonable to think that on Mars impacts broke the ground with cracks since faults are often formed in impact craters on Earth. One could guess that these ridge networks were dikes, but dikes would go more or less in the same direction, as compared to these ridges that have a large variety of orientations. Since the ridges occur in locations with clay, these formations could serve as a marker for clay which requires water for its formation.Mangold et al. 2007.

Water here could have supported past life in these locations. Clay may also preserve fossils or other traces of past life. These ridges could be formed by large impacts that produced fractures, faults, or dikes made up of melted rock and/or crushed rock (breccia).Pascuzzo, A., J. Mustard. 2017. ONGOING CRISM INVESTIGATION OF RIDGE NETWORKS AND THEIR PHYLLOSILICATEBEARING HOST UNIT IN THE NILI FOSSAE AND NORTHEAST SYRTIS REGIONS. Lunar and Planetary Science XLVIII (2017). 2807. pdf. One formation mechanism proposed by Quinn and Ehlmann in 2017 was that sediment was deposited and eventually the sediment underwent diagenesis which caused a loss of volume and fractures. After erosion exposed the fractures, they were filled with minerals possibly by acid-sulfate fluids. More erosion removed softer materials and left the more resistant ridges behind.Quinn, D., B. Ehlmann. 2017. THE DEPOSITION AND ALTERATION HISTORY OF THE NORTHEAST SYRTIS LAYERED SULFATES. Lunar and Planetary Science XLVIII (2017). 2932.pdf. If the impact-caused dike is made of purely melted rock from the heat of the impact, it is called a pseudotachylite .http://www.impact- structures.com/impact-rocks-impactites/the-impact-breccia-page/suevite-or- suevite-breccia-2/ Also, hydrothermalism may have been involved due to the heat generated during impacts.Osinski, G., et al. 2013. Impact-generated hydrothermal systems on Earth and Mars. Icarus: 224, 347-363. Strong evidence for hydrothermalism was reported by a team of researchers studying Auki Crater. This crater contains ridges that may have been produced after fractures formed with an impact.

Persephone Books  Beauman's Persephone Books is a publishing house focusing primarily on female authors. Founded in 1998, it is run from a shop in a Grade II listed building on Lamb's Conduit Street, in London's Bloomsbury. According to The Guardian, Beauman founded Persephone Books to publish 'forgotten' novels by women, many of which she had written about in, A Very Great Profession: The Woman's Novel 1914-39, originally published by Virago in 1983 and reissued in 2008 by Persephone Books. The books all come in a uniform grey cover, which Beauman sees as 'a guarantee of a good read'. In an interview with journalist Leonie Cooper, Beauman said that when she first started the press things were hard, \\"We had a lot of books piling up in the warehouse, but then we got a bestseller, which was phenomenally lucky.\\" That bestseller was Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson, which Persephone Books published in 2000. Since then Persephone Books has continued to publish several books a year, and currently has 115 titles in print, including novels by Dorothy Whipple, Virginia Woolf, R. C.

Biography  Born as Harukichi Inoue, he later adopted the surname of his wife when they married in 1907.Shimoi Harukichi and Italian fascism - On His Relations with D'Annunzio, Mussolini and Japanese Society (PDF), in Fukuokakokusaidaigaku kiy≈ç, n¬∫ 25, 2011, pp. 53-66 He finished his studies in Japan, and had the occasion to meet Bin Ueda, by whom he was profoundly influenced. Shimoi then moved to Italy to study Dante, becoming a Japanese teacher at the Naples Eastern University. In 1917, he enlisted in the Italian army during World War I, and committed himself to fighting against the Central Powers. Harukichi became an Ardito, teaching his fellow soldiers some karate. Using his diplomatic passport that allowed him great freedom of movement, Shimoi acted after the war as a liaison for secret mails between Gabriele D'Annunzio, then regent of Fiume, and Benito Mussolini, at the time the head of the Italian Fasci di Combattimento and editor of Il Popolo d'Italia . Shimoi was, among other things, one of the people first entering the Fiume Endeavour of the Italian poet. D'Annunzio nicknamed Shimoi \\"comrade Samurai\\" and \\"the Samurai of Fiume\\". Together they promoted and organized the Rome-Tokyo flight performed by the aviator Arturo Ferrarin. Returning to Naples in 1920, he founded the Japanese literature magazine Sakura, that would be published until March of the following year for a total of five issues. In 1934 he served as an interpreter to the founder of Judo, Jigoro Kano, while he was staying in Italy. The translated interviews given by Kano were a mainspring for the development of such discipline in Italy. Getting back to his homeland, Shimoi helped the Italian Embassy in Tokyo to stop the pro-Ethiopian activities of the Japanese rightist clubs during the war in Ethiopia. Shimoi was one of the best known Japanese supporters of Italian fascism, seeing some analogies between the fascist principles and the traditional values of Japanese culture, especially the Bushido. He argued that fascism was a natural ramification of the risorgimento, and that its role was to be a \\"spiritual movement\\" that would make Italians identify as being part of the new nation. While being a supporter of fascism in Italy, Shimoi didn't ever promote it in Japan, considering such movement an Italian cultural phenomenon. After the second World War, Shimoi met and became friends with Indro Montanelli, who arrived in Japan to work on a series of reportages. Shimoi became his guide around the country.  Literary work  Shimoi translated numerous works from Japanese into Italian and vice versa. He translated works by a number of Japanese authors like Akiko Yosano and Matsuo Bash≈ç, while his translations into Japanese included D'Annunzio and Dante. In 1920, Shimoi even promoted the construction of a temple dedicated to him in Tokyo. Some of his works include Shinto Ponpeo or tou tame ni (1926), dedicated to the ruins of the Roman city of Pompeii, and The Italian war seen by a Japanese (1919).

Biography Tasos started painting at a very young age; at the age of 16 he did wall paintings at commercial and non-commercial spaces and later turned to scenography, movie-poster design and conservation of old wall paintings. Since 2005, he has been focusing exclusively on oil paintings with themes evolving from a series of interiors to landscapes and his most recent series of cars painted against urban backgrounds. His Interiors work is inspired by the lives of people who lived inside neoclassical buildings like the one that hosts his atelier in Kipseli. Because of his particular depiction of sun light entering the spaces, his collection of Interiors paintings is often described by art critics as presenting \\"the illusion of space that belongs to a different, third dimension\\". He made his first solo exhibition at the gallery \\"Agathi\\" in 2006 and has taken part in many group exhibitions in Greece and abroad. Today, his paintings are being auctioned at large auction houses across Europe such as the Bonhams of London. He is collaborating with renowned galleries across Europe. A non-exhaustive list of galleries includes: * Paris ‚Äì Modus Art Gallery, Galerie de Medicis * London ‚Äì Saatchi Gallery * Cyprus The price range of this paintings in past auctions has been from $5,000 to $25,000.  Honors, awards and distinctions  Tasos has received significant awards and prizes over the years. In 2011, he received the second place award among 5,777 contestants in a competition organized by the Saatchi Gallery of London. He had participated two more times before his 2011 award in Saatchi Gallery competitions where he held the 10th and 8th position respectively.

She was the daughter of William Simson (1811‚Äì1858), secretary of the Bank of Scotland, and Jane Christiana Aberdein (b. 1820) and was one of nine children. She lived with her family in Eton Terrace, New Town, for much of her life.  Education  Frances Simson was the eldest, at 38 years of age, of the all the women who graduated in Masters of Arts, made possible by the Universities (Scotland) Act of 1889. Simson had enrolled in 1867 to degree classes delivered by the Edinburgh Association for the University Education of Women (EAUEW; formerly the Edinburgh Ladies' Educational Association, ELEA, founded in 1867).  Women's Rights  Together with Margaret Nairn, Elsie Inglis, Frances Melville and Chrystal Macmillan, Simson petitioned the right for five women graduates to vote for the university MP at the general election of 1906 to no avail. They also failed an appeal November 1907, so rallied to raise ¬£1000 to support mounting their case to the House of Lords in November 1908 where Macmillan opened and performed as senior counsel, with Simson making general argument and closing the case on 12 November. Simson was warden of Masson Hall of Residence for Women Students in Edinburgh between the years of 1897-1917.  Later life  In October 1933, the year University of Edinburgh celebrated its 350th anniversary, Simson was awarded an honorary degree of LLD, as the only woman graduand, recognising her responsibility in the university education of women. Later that year, at the time she was president of the Edinburgh Equal Citizenship Society she was honoured in a luncheon held at the site of the former Caledonian Hotel on Princes Street, Edinburgh.

(\\"Kadenze\\"), is a for-profit massive open online course (MOOC) provider that offers courses geared toward art, music, and creative technology, fields which are falling behind other fields such as computer science in terms of number of courses offered in the MOOC space. It was launched on June 16, 2015 with 18 academic partners including: Stanford University, Princeton University, UCLA, California Institute of the Arts, School of Art Institute of Chicago, Maryland Institute College of Art, Goldsmiths College, MassArt, Seoul Institute of the Arts, Paris College of Art, National University of Singapore, Cornish College of Art, University of Texas at Austin, Rhode Island School of Design, Pacific Northwest College of Art, Arizona State University, Columbus College of Art and Design, and School of Visual Arts.  Platform and technology  The primary method of learning on kadenze.com is through video-based lectures. Courses typically range from five to eight sessions long, with each session broken up into a group of short lessons. A course can run in either Scheduled or Adaptive mode. A Scheduled course follows a set calendar, with a course start/end date, prescribed due dates for assignments, and new lecture content that is released on specific dates (e.g. once a week). Adaptive courses are more flexible in terms of scheduling, allowing learners to initiate sessions and progress through course material at their own pace. While all video are immediately accessible when running in Adaptive mode, assignments are ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù upon completing the previous assignment. A suggested due date of 1-week is set to help learners stay on track, however, learners can go at their own pace. Core to the used Kannu platform is the ability to embed media (image, video, audio) nearly anywhere on the platform, such as a course's forums and gallery. This enables learners and customers/purchasers of the Premium membership to engage with one another's works without the need to leave the learning environment. This also expands the possibilities of peer assessment based learning methods (which is a common form of assessment on MOOC platforms).  Membership  kadenze.com offers a tier-based membership model. The free tier enables learners to watch all lecture material, and to participate in the course forums. A fee-based Premium membership allows students to have full participation in courses, submit assignments, receive grades and feedback, collaborate with peers, build their online portfolio, and gain eligibility to receive a verified Certificate of Accomplishment if a course is completed satisfactorily. Additionally, many courses offer Premium Members access to exclusive student discounts from the kadenze.com industrial partners. Some courses on kadenze.com are also offered as credit-eligible, meaning that learners can take the course for actual college credit from the partnering institution. Many of the individual courses in area of sub specialization are available as part of a Program.  History  As of February 2017 kadenze.com has expanded its partner list to 31 educational partners including two non-profit organizations. Today, kadenze.com offers approximately 100 courses in a number of creativity related fields including business, music, music technology, visual arts, creative computing, computational graphics, design, history and culture, fashion, entertainment technology, math, game design, film, curation, and web development. Many of these courses are similar to courses already taught at partner non-profit public and private institutions, and feature the staff and faculty from these partner institutions. The kadenze.com website does not disclose the terms of agreement or the level of financial remuneration it offers the staff and faculty already holding positions at non-profit partner institutions. Additionally, Kadenze has established partnerships with industrial for-profit partners including Ableton, Adobe, Cognella, Focusrite, Manning Publications, Output, Autodesk, Native Instruments, Novation, and RME. These courses are offered under the Kadenze Academy banner. Some of the industrial partners offer kadenze.com premium members additional benefits. Similarly, the kadenze.com website does not disclose the terms of agreement it has with industrial partners and whether the industrial partners also have pre-existing agreements with partner institution, which is likely due to commercial sensitivities. On November 19, 2015, Kadenze launched Kannu, a learning management system geared toward creative education, music, arts, and design. Early adopters of the customized platform on campus were California Institute of the Arts, Otis College of Art and Design Rhode Island School of Design, Goldsmiths College, Stanford University and non academic institutions such as Unity and Maker Media Inc.

Life Richard Fester was born in Frankfurt where his father, Dr. Anselm Fester worked as a lawyer-notary. The boy attended secondary school in the city till 1881 and then volunteered for a year of military service. He undertook his university studies in History and Philology at Munich, Berlin and Strasbourg. It was at Strasbourg that he passed his university final exams and also, on 6 March 1886, received his doctorate for work on the Imperial Military Constitution of the Holy Roman Empire at the end of the seventeenth century. His habilitation qualification followed, from Munich, on 18 November 1893. Between July 1888 and September 1892 he was also working as an assistant at the Regional Archives Office in Karlsruhe. From 1893 he was giving private tutorials at Munich. He moved to northern Bavaria (Franconia) in 1896, taking a post as a visiting professor in Medieval and Modern History at Erlangen, which became a full professorship three years later on 16 October 1899. On 1 April 1907 he switched to Kiel, taking a position as Professor of Medieval and Modern History. Less than two years later, in October 1908, he moved again, this time to Halle where he took an equivalent professorship, also becoming co-director for Historical Seminars. H remained at Halle for eighteen years, retiring from his position on 1 October 1926, by which time he had reached the age of 66. During the First World War (1914-1918) Fester took a lead in fund raising as a result of which he was awarded the Merit Cross for War Aid (Verdienstkreuz f√ºr Kriegshilfe). He also became, between 1917 and 1918, a member of the short- lived nationalist German Fatherland Party (Deutsche Vaterlandspartei / DVLP). In 1925 Fester drew widespread attention to himself in the context of the Munich \\"Stab in the back\\" trial by accusing the Social Democratic movement of treason. R√©gime change early in 1933 triggered the launch in Germany of a twelve-year Nazi dictatorship. After 1935 Fester emerged from retirement to work at the antisemitic National Institute for the History of the New Germany (\\"Reichsinstitut f√ºr Geschichte des neuen Deutschlands\\"), serving on the institute's \\"Committee of Experts\\". Here he issued various antisemitic speeches and essays, such as one describing Judaism as a \\"Ferment of National Decomposition\\" (¬ªFerment der nationalen Dekomposition¬ª, 1940) and as a \\"Destructive element of the Nation\\" (¬ªZersetzungselement der V√∂lker¬ª, 1941).Helmut Heiber: Walter Frank und sein Reichsinstitut f√ºr Geschichte des neuen Deutschlands, Stuttgart 1966, pp. 466 & 596 (footnotes) Weeding War ended a few months after Fester's death. From May 1945 a large part of what had been Germany was administered as the Soviet occupation zone, giving way in October 1949 to the German Democratic Republic a separate German state. Within this area the authorities compiled a list of Literature to be weeded out. Several of Fester's published writings from the Nazi period were included on the list, including those identified in the previous paragraph. In 1947 his work \\"Friedrich Wilhelm I., Friedrich der Gro√üe und die Anf√§nge deutscher Staatsgesinnung\\" covering Prussian expansion in the eighteenth century was added to the list, joined in 1953 by his analysis of international developments between 1914 and 1919.

He is the former chairman and founding member of the United Patriots Front (UPF) and the Lads Society. He has been convicted of several charges, including stalking, arson, drug dealing and burglary, and has spent time in prison. Political leaning Cottrell has right-wing extremist views, he has been described by numerous media outlets and Australia's former Race Discrimination Commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, as a neo-Nazi. He has been convicted of charges of inciting hatred against communities.An abridged list of articles that describe Cottrell as a neo-Nazi:   * Cottrell has stated a desire to see a portrait of Adolf Hitler hung in Australian classrooms and for copies of Mein Kampf to be \\"issued annually\\" to students as well as anti-Semitic and racist comments in support of Nazism. Cottrell has denied supporting Nazism.  * Political/anti-social activities In October 2015, Blair Cottrell replaced Shermon Burgess as chairman of the United Patriots Front, and is a founding member of the Lads Society. In September 2017, Cottrell, Neil Erikson and Chris Shortis were found guilty by a magistrate of inciting contempt against Muslims after they had enacted and made a video of a fake beheading, in order to protest against the building of a mosque in Bendigo. Each was fined $2,000. Cottrell lodged an appeal, applying for his case to be heard in the High Court of Australia and arguing that he had been charged under an \\"invalid law\\". This was thrown out in February 2019, and he tried to have the matter heard in the Supreme Court of Victoria. The district court judge ruled that there were matters to be decided in her court, such as his intentions in making the video, before the case could proceed to a higher court, and set a date for the appeal to be heard in the county court. The county court dismissed Cottrell's appeal in December 2019. The judge also said: \\"even if the ends were political, the means remain vilifying. Having a political end is not a defence to the charge.‚ÄúFar-right extremist Blair Cottrell loses appeal against conviction for inciting contempt of Muslims =Christchurch mosque shooter connections= In the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand on 15 March 2019, it was discovered that the perpetrator, Brenton Harrison Tarrant of Grafton, New South Wales, Australia, had interacted with Cottrell's United Patriots Front (UPF) on its Facebook pages. He affectionately called Blair Cottrell \\"Emperor Blair Cottrell\\" and celebrated Donald Trump's victory as President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election, as well as donating to the UPF and threatening a man from Melbourne, Victoria, Australia over criticism of the organisation in 2016. Cottrell had distanced himself from Tarrant and denounced his attacks, stating he didn't know him. He conceded it was possible that a UPF member did meet him at one point. Tarrant was also offered to join the Lads Society, a fight club also led by Cottrell, but declined. =Sky News appearance= In August 2018, News Corp news outlet Sky News Australia was criticised for providing a platform to Cottrell in a one-on-one discussion about immigration. Sky News reporter Laura Jayes took offence at his appearance on the program due to the fact that he has expressed admiration for Hitler and claimed to have manipulated women \\"using violence and terror\\". Political editor of Sky News David Speers was also critical of Cottrell's appearance on the show. Sky News commentator and former Labor Party minister Craig Emerson resigned in protest after the interview was broadcast, saying that the decision to give Cottrell a platform on Sky was \\"another step in a journey to normalising racism & bigotry in our country\\". Cottrell subsequently tweeted about Jayes: \\"I might as well have raped @ljayes on the air, not only would she have been happier with that but the reaction would‚Äôve been the same.\\" Activist groups called on advertisers to pull advertising campaigns off Sky News.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-06/sky-news-apologises-for-airing- interview-with-blair-cottrell/10076074 Criminal activities In 2012, Cottrell served four months in Port Phillip Prison after being convicted of stalking his ex-girlfriend and her new partner, and of arson after attempting to burn down the man's house. In December 2013 he was fined $1,000 and sentenced to seven days in jail by a County Court judge for aggravated burglary, property damage, arson, testosterone trafficking, possessing a controlled weapon and breaching court orders. * See also * Far-right politics in Australia * National Socialist Party of Australia, defunct Australian neo-Nazi political party * Pauline Hanson's One Nation (PHON), political party founded by Pauline Hanson  PHON senator Fraser Anning, who interacted with Cottrell, attending a January 2019 rally organised by him * Reclaim Australia, related far-right Australian group, predecessor to the United Patriots Front References Further reading * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Australian nationalists Category:Alt- right Category:Alt-right politicians in Oceania Category:Anti-immigration politics in Oceania Category:Antisemitism in Australia Category:Australian white nationalists Category:Far-right politics in Australia Category:Islamophobia in Australia Category:Neo-Nazism Category:Opposition to Islam in Australia Category:Persecution of Muslims Category:Racism in Australia Category:White supremacists ","title":"Blair Cottrell"},{"id":"49473630","text":"Charles A.

False measure;: A satirical novel of the lives and objectives of upper middle- class Negroes (1954) source It originally sold for $3.50, and was praised by Jet Magazine for standing out amongst other race-related novels in America for breaking from the interracial romance and poverty centered conflicts. His novel dealt with the superficial values of the middle class black community who ‚Äúfeud for supremacy in the tinseled world like cats and dogs‚Äù. source Criminal Life After his first publication, Smythwick was charged and plead guilty for conspiracy in a 1951 income tax fraud. Working in an organized group from within his job at Manhattan‚Äôs New York Internal Revenue Collector‚Äôs office, ‚Äúfraudulent returns were mailed to non-existent parties, then cashed‚Äù, using false tax rebate checks. The alleged leader and former chief clerk Ruth McAdoo Serge, committed suicide before trial. The heist was estimated to be worth about $100,000. Smythwick was indicted in 1951, and sentenced to three years in prison in 1954. Publications Smythwick was featured in Jet Magazine a total of three times.

The version that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was built in 1927. This structure, long, carried East Evans Creek County Road over the creek in the rural community of Wimer. The creek is a tributary of the Rogue River, which it joins at the small city of Rogue River. An earlier covered span, built in 1892 by J. W. Osbourne, crossed the creek at this location, according to local residents and an engineering database. The 1927 bridge replaced the older span. After the 1927 bridge deteriorated, local residents refurbished it in 1962. However, by the mid-1970s the bridge was closed after further decline. Repairs in 1985 led to reopening with an eight-ton limit, later reduced to three tons. Before further repairs were undertaken, the structure collapsed in 2003. It fell into the water, injuring three people who were crossing the bridge. In 2008, with the help of federal funds and local labor, the bridge was replaced with a look- alike using trusses reinforced with metal braces, laminated beams that look like timber, concrete approaches, and industrial roofing made to resemble wooden shakes. The one-way bridge, still wide, as was the original, has a load limit of 10 tons. This version of the bridge opened to traffic in February 2008.

Early years Harriott Horry Rutledge was born in Charleston, SC, on August 12, 1832, the only child of Rebecca Motte Lowndes and Edward Cotesworth Rutledge, a naval captain. Her family was well-connected: her mother was the daughter of Congressman William Lowndes, granddaughter of statesman Thomas Pinckney, and great-granddaughter of agriculturalist Eliza Pinckney and judge Charles Pinckney; Eliza Pinckney and William Lowndes would later be the subject of biographies by Ravenel. One of her uncles was herpetologist John Edwards Holbrook. Ravenel's literary talent is evident in surviving letters she wrote as a child. She was educated at Madame Talvande's private school, housed in the Sword Gate House. In 1851, she married the American physician and agricultural chemist St. Julien Ravenel, with whom she had nine children. One of her sons, Francis, would marry Charleston poet Beatrice Witte, and their daughter Beatrice St. Julien Ravenel was also a writer. 5 East Battery in Charleston, SC, where Horriott Horry Ravenel lived with her family. It had been inherited by her husband, St. Julien Ravenel. Illustration by Vernon Howe Bailey for Charleston: The Place and the People, by Harriott Horry Ravenel (1906). Writing At the outbreak of the Civil War, Ravenel accompanied her husband to Columbia, SC, where he was to take charge of a laboratory to produce medicines for the Confederate States Army. Ravenel's experiences in 1865 trying to save their home from fire when the city burned following the arrival of General Sherman featured in an article, \\"When Columbia Burned,\\" as well as in one of her books, South Carolina Women in the Confederacy (1903). She was a close friend of Mary Chesnut, who wrote a celebrated Civil War diary. After the war, Ravenel and her family moved back to Charleston. Ravenel started writing short stories in the 1870s and published a novella about antebellum South Carolina, Ashurst; or, The Days That Are Not, in 1879. Published (like some of her other early writing) under the pseudonym 'Mrs. H. Hilton Broom', it won a local newspaper award. She is best known, however, for her three books about the history of South Carolina in general and Charleston in particular: The Life of Eliza Pinckney (1896), The Life and Times of William Lowndes (1901), and Charleston: The Place and the People (1906). The illustrations for the latter book were by Vernon Howe Bailey. Ravenel was a good writer and an able historian, and Charleston: The Place and the People‚Äîwhich devoted nine-tenths of its 500 pages to the years before 1830‚Äîwas influential in establishing a strain of backward-looking literature in South Carolina. Ravenel's book on Eliza Pinckney, which centered on Pinckney's letters with a running commentary by Ravenel, was the first full-length biography of Pinckney that didn't heavily fictionalize her life, and it helped to spur renewed scholarly interest in Pinckney's life and accomplishments. Ravenel was one of the earliest members of the South Carolina Historical Society and served as president (1896‚Äì98) of the South Carolina Society of the Colonial Dames of America. Ravenel died July 2, 1912, in Charleston, having survived her husband by thirty years. Documents (including diaries) concerning Ravenel and various relatives are held by the South Carolina Historical Society. The Charleston Library Society holds a portrait of Ravenel painted by Charles Van Dyke shortly before her death.

The genus contains a single species, Araripenymphes seldeni. The genus was named after the basin. History and classification When first described, A. seldoni was known from a single fossil adult which is a compression-impression fossil preserved in layers of soft sedimentary rock. Along with other well-preserved insect fossils, the A. seldoni specimens were collected from layers of the Upper Aptian Crato Formation. The formation is composed of unweathered grey and oxidized yellow limestones, which preserved numerous insects, fish, birds and reptiles as a notable lagerst√§tte. The area is a preserved inland lake or one of a series of lakes, though the nature as a fresh or salt-water body is uncertain. The depth of the basin has been suggested as either shallow or fairly deep. The basin formed near the center of the supercontinent Gondwana during the early part of the diversification of flowering plants. The A. seldoni holotype specimen was preserved in the Brazilian Society of Paleoarthropodology collections when first studied. The fossil was described by paleontologists Federica Menon, Rafael G. Martins-Neto and David M. Martill in a 2005 paper. The genus name is a combination of Araripe, for the Araripe Basin where the fossil was collected, combined with nymphes, taken from the family name Nymphidae. They coined the specific epithet seldoni to honor Paul Selden, professor with the University of Manchester. A second specimen was described by Justine Myskowiak and a research team who published a description of it and a slight revision of the genus diagnosis in 2016.  Description  The species shows probable sexual dimorphism, with differences in the wing coloration and wing lengths noted between fossils SBPr-I-2365 and iQ563. In SBPr-I-2365 the fore wings are longer than iQ563, which has long fore wings. In contrast the hind wings of iQ563 are longer than the long hind wings of SBPr-I-2365. In addition to the length differences, all four wings of iQ563 display mottled light and dark color patterning, while the wings of SBPr-I-2365 are hyaline and have no patterning at all. The full body length of iQ563 is approximately . The heads of both fossils are shorter than wide, with large eyes placed on the sides. The antennae of SBPr-I-2365 are long and have many segments, while the antennae of iQ563 were not preserved. In both specimens the abdomen terminations are poorly preserved making gender identification impossible.

Brief history Ed Schieffelin in 1880 Tombstone was a mining town founded in 1879 by Ed Schieffelin. Schieffelin was a prospector who laid claim to what became one of the biggest silver mines in Pima County, Arizona Territory. The mine was named the Schieffelin Mine. Schieffelin, together with some partners, owned or had interest in the Contention Mine and the Tombstone Mining and Milling Company, which owned the Tough Nut Mine. Prospectors and business entrepreneurs began to settle the town after news spread of the silver strike.\\"Arizona Pioneers' Historical Society\\"; journal=Arizoniana; year=1960;page=17\\"The Schieffelin Family\\"; Publisher=Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library On October 26, 1881, Tombstone gained national notoriety with the famous Gunfight at the O.K. Corral involving the brothers Wyatt, Morgan, and Virgil Earp (the town marshal and a deputy U.S. marshal), joined by Doc Holliday, against Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, Tom McLaury, and Billy Claiborne, members of an outlaw group called the Cochise County Cowboys. Bird Cage Theatre poker table where the longest poker game was played One of Tombstones best known structures is the historic Bird Cage Theatre. The theatre provided the citizens of the town with entertainment including live performances, liquor, prostitutes, and poker games. The longest poker game in history was played in the basement of the theater. Players had to pay $1,000 for a seat at the table. Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Bat Masterson, George Hearst, Diamond Jim Brady, and Adolphus Busch were some of the notable players. The poker game was played continuously 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for eight years from 1881 to 1889. Approximately $10 million was exchanged in the game through those eight years, and the Bird Cage retained ten percent of that money.THE LONGEST POKER GAMETombstone, Arizona - The Old West's Most Historic Town The Bird Cage Theater The structures along Allen Street are included in the Tombstone Historic District, which was declared a National Historic Landmark on July 4, 1961.

It was directed either by M√©li√®s or by his assistant, an actor known as Manuel. Plot A stage actress's wealthy admirer, or \\"Stage Door Johnnie\\", brings a bouquet to the theatre and asks a stagehand to pass it along to the admired actress. The stagehand, for a practical joke, changes the card on the bouquet so that it appears to be meant for the theater's lady janitor. The janitor, accepting the flowers, sends the Stage Door Johnnie a note telling him to meet her at the stage door. The Stage Door Johnnie, shocked to see the janitor approaching, tries unsuccessfully to escape her embrace. He finally struggles away, as the theatre's stagehands laugh at the success of the joke.Since only fragments of the film survive, this summary is adapted from . Production Fernande Albany played the janitor in the film. The scene in front of the stage door was shot outdoors, on M√©li√®s's property in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis, in front of the remaining section of a house that had belonged to his father Louis M√©li√®s. (Some of the house had been taken down during the construction of M√©li√®s's second and larger film studio, Studio B.) Georges M√©li√®s had previously used the same location for his 1907 film The Good Luck of a \\"Souse\\".

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. Geography Tullybrack is bounded on the north by Tullyloughfin townland, on the west by Owencam townland, on the south by Tullywaum and Tullytrasna townlands and on the east by Eaglehill and Corracholia More townlands. Its chief geographical features are a mountain stream and a gravel pit. Tullybrack is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 192 statute acres. History In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land. A lease dated 17 September 1816 John Enery of Bawnboy includes Tullybrack. The Tithe Applotment Books for 1826 list the following tithepayers in the townland- Darcy, Finlay, Magauran, McGoldrick.Tithe Applotment Books 1826 The Ordnance Survey Name Books for 1836 give the following description of the townland- Tullybrack. Contains 192 acres, of which 79 are cultivated boggy pasture and 4 are bog...The townland is bounded on the N. by a large mountain stream. The Tullybrack Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839. In 1841 there were 10 houses in the townland, of which 2 were uninhabited. The population was 51, 25 males and 26 females. In 1851 there were 12 houses in the townland, of which 2 were uninhabited. The population was 68, 40 males and 28 females. So the Great Famine (Ireland) did not seem to have an effect on the population. Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists thirteen landholders in the townland.

The book Bawnboy and Templeport History Heritage Folklore, by Chris Maguire, gives the following description of the school A number of stories, mostly folklore, which appear in this book were collected by Frank Maguire, who for many years was a teacher in Tullybrack N.S. One of his predecessors as teacher in Tullybrack was John O'Hara, Corlough. John had been a hedge schoolmaster in the area before Tullybrack school was built. It was he who drew up the plans of the first Tullybrack school which was built in 1842. Mrs. O'Hara (no relation) from Lannanerriagh, was principal of Tullybrack N.S. from 1842-1850. At this time and later while teaching in Tullybrack, John lived in the townland of Corlough. A few years ago I had a letter from Monica, a granddaughter of John O'Hara, who lives in England. She writes as follows 'I don't know much about my grandfather, John O'Hara. He was a hedge schoolmaster who died in 1880. He could teach Latin, Irish, English reading and writing, and Mathematics, and he was a missionary, too. Hundreds of adults on that Cavan mountain - Upper Corlough, could only speak the Irish language. They seldom or never went to school or church at that time. There was only a wooden hut for a church in Corlough. Grandfather saw to it that they were all baptized and he had classes for them. He had a lot to do with getting that church (Corlough) off the ground. There was no priests' house but a priest came to say Mass on Sunday, so grandfather was curate. I don't know half of it. He also had a Sunday school. The priest who said Mass had breakfast with grandfather on Sundays. Then they discussed parish affairs and made arrangements for getting parish work done. Grandfather worked an eight-day week. When the new Corlough church was built it had bare stone walls, a roof and a mud floor. The people were very poor, there was no money. My aunt was a young girl then. 'When you'd stand or kneel the dust would choke you' Aunt said. She often said Grandfather should have been a priest'. I have seen the original lease for 999 years given by George Finlay, Esquire, J.P., Corville, Bawnboy, 1st part; The Commissioners of Education 2nd part, their Trustees, 3rd part, dated 12 December 1842, now in possession of Philip McGovern, Tullybrack, Corlough. The Trustees were Very Rev. Philip Magauran P.P., Springhill, Edward Reilly, Gubnagree and Patrick Magauran, Tullybrack all of the parish of Templeport. Attached to the lease is a plan of the school and playground drawn up by John O'Hara, Surveyor, 7 October 1842. Area of school ground 2 roods 1 perch Irish Plantation Measure. And whereas there has been built and erected on the ground hereinafter mentioned and demised, a school-house for the Education of the Poor Children (male and female) in the Parish of Templeport aforesaid to be called Tullybrack N.S. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. and the Commissioners of the said school directed that a sum of seventy four pounds three shillings and four pence sterling should be paid to the said Trustees‚Ä¶.. together with another sum of fifty three pounds one shilling and eight pence raised by voluntary contributions or locally subscribed makes the sum of ¬£127-5s, which last mentioned sum has been laid out and expended in the erection of said schoolhouse. In the 1830s the original teacher John O'Hara wrote several letters to John O'Donovan (scholar) about the history of the area and these are available for perusal in the Graves Collection in the Royal Irish Academy Dublin.

It first aired on the Freeform network in the United States on February 16, 2016. The episode was directed and written by executive producer and frequent collaborator Joseph Dougherty. In the episode, new relationships cause confusion and tense moments. The Liars start to investigate Sara Harvey, while themselves being investigated by Detective Tanner. Upon its initial airing, the episode yielded 1.36 million viewers and a 0.7 demo rating, up from the previous episode, and received generally mixed reviews from critics, who criticized its pacing and felt that its writing was mostly sluggish and reminiscent of the show's weakest episodes.  Plot  As the girls continue to be targeted by the new 'A', they must deal with the consequences of their lies and the jeopardy they have put their loved ones in. Hanna (Ashley Benson) deals with the repercussions of quitting her job and, despite finding comfort with Jordan (David Coussins), she begins to worry that her new relationship is in danger when the new 'A' begins to hint at her to end her relationship. Spencer (Troian Bellisario) and Caleb (Tyler Blackburn) discover a file on Yvonne's phone containing Veronica's (Lesley Fera) medical records and Spencer becomes worried that her mother is keeping secrets from her regarding her health, which could possibly jeopardize her campaign. Liam (Roberto Aguire) surprises Aria (Lucy Hale) in Rosewood and Aria admits to Liam the truth about Ezra's new book after he reveals to her the writing is too similar to her own. Alison (Sasha Pieterse) explains to Spencer that she and Elliott (Huw Collins) are more than just friends, but they cannot reveal their relationship as it would be deemed \\"inappropriate\\". Spencer confronts Mona (Janel Parrish), who tells her that she had Yvonne leave her phone on purpose because she wanted Spencer to find the file. Emily (Shay Mitchell) is devastated when she discovers that her eggs have been destroyed, as well as countless others, after a freezer \\"malfunctioned\\", but she believes that the new 'A' had something to do with it. Detective Tanner (Roma Maffia) tells Emily she finds it suspicious that homicides only occur when the girls are in town and reveals her intentions of digging deeper into the murder of Charlotte DiLuarentis. Hanna, Emily and Aria investigate the mysterious alleyway to which the ladder in Sara's room leads to and uncover a secret passage that leads to somewhere out the back of the hotel. Ezra (Ian Harding) returns and reveals to Aria that the night of Charlotte's death, he saw Aria's parents who asked him not to tell her that that were getting close again and after a few drinks, he went home, stating his innocence. He also gives Aria the next three chapters of his book which incidentally she has already written for him. The episode ends with Spencer discovering Melissa's suitcase is broken with the missing part matching the description of the alleged murder weapon.

The Type ZB tender entered service in 1892, as tenders to the second batch of Mastodon type steam locomotives to be acquired by the Cape Government Railways. These locomotives were designated on the South African Railways in 1912.South African Railways & Harbours/Suid Afrikaanse Spoorwe√´ en Hawens (15 Aug 1941).

Drawing Office/Tekenkantoor, Pretoria. pp. 6a-7a, 41. Manufacturer The Types ZA and ZB tenders were both introduced in 1892 as tenders to the original Cape Government Railways (CGR) 7th Class Mastodon type locomotive, which was built in two batches. Six engines were built by D√ºbs and Company in 1892, and 32 by Neilson and Company in 1892 and 1893. Since a Neilson works picture shows one of the Neilson-built batch of locomotives with a three-axle tender, it is likely that the larger-capacity Type ZB three-axle tenders were delivered with the second batch of 32 7th Class locomotives, built by Neilson. The locomotive and tender were designed at the Salt River works in Cape Town in 1892, under the supervision of H.M. Beatty, the CGR Western System's Locomotive Superintendent. The Type ZB entered service as tenders to these locomotives, all of which were initially placed in service on the Midland System of the CGR, but were later distributed between the Midland and Eastern Systems. These engines would be designated Class 7 on the South African Railways (SAR) in 1912. Characteristics The tender had a coal capacity of and a water capacity of , with an average maximum axle load of . Locomotive In the SAR years, tenders were numbered for the engines they were delivered with. In most cases, an oval number plate, bearing the engine number and often also the locomotive class or tender type, would be attached to the rear end of the tender. During the classification and renumbering of locomotives onto the SAR roster in 1912, no separate classification and renumbering list was published for tenders, which should have been renumbered according to the locomotive renumbering list.Classification of S.A.R. Engines with Renumbering Lists, issued by the Chief Mechanical Engineer‚Äôs Office, Pretoria, January 1912, pp. 8, 12, 15, 37 (Reprinted in April 1987 by SATS Museum, R.3125-6/9/11-1000) Only Class 7 locomotives were delivered new with Type ZB tenders. The 32 Neilson-built tenders should have been numbered in the SAR number ranges from 954 to 967 and 975 to 977 in respect of the seventeen ex-Midland System engines, and 970 to 974 and 978 to 987 in respect of the fifteen ex-Eastern System engines. Having already been in service for twenty years by then and given the interchangeability of tenders between engines, it is possible, but not confirmed, that tenders were numbered for the engines they were attached to at the time. Classification letters Since many tender types are interchangeable between different locomotive classes and types, a tender classification system was adopted by the SAR. The first letter of the tender type indicates the classes of engines to which it could be coupled. The \\"Z_\\" tenders could be used with the following locomotive classes: * CGR 7th Class of 1892, SAR Class 7. * CGR 7th Class of 1896, SAR Class 7A. * Imperial Military Railways 7th Class, SAR Class 7B. * CGR 7th Class of 1902, SAR Class 7C. * Rhodesia Railways 7th Class, SAR Class 7D. * New Cape Central Railways 7th Class of 1899, SAR Class 7E. * New Cape Central Railways 7th Class of 1913, SAR Class 7F.

Another new feature is the Juggler in the middle of the playfield that shoots the ball up and then U-turns back down to the Pop bumpers and also acts as the ball lock for multiball. Several other features return from both Comet and Cyclone as well, like the Comet ramp in the middle of the playfield and the Ferris wheel mechanism from Cyclone In which this game has a double Ferris Wheel other than a single one to carry the ball from one ferris wheel to another, then to the ramp and back to the playfield. Other features include the dummy and the shooting gallery targets in form of Cats and Ducks that returned from Comet. Another feature of this game is a rotating backglass that is similar to Cyclone's award wheel with the Hurricane rollercoaster spinning around and choosing the award the player receives on the Dot-Matrix display.

Beyond its kernel, Zephyr includes all the components and libraries needed to develop a full application such as device drivers, protocol stacks, file systems, and firmware updates.  History  In November 2015, it was originally developed as Rocket kernel by Wind River Systems for Internet of things (IoT) devices. In February 2016, Zephyr became a project of the Linux Foundation. Since then, early members and supporters of Zephyr include Intel, NXP Semiconductors, Synopsys, Linaro, Texas Instruments, DeviceTone, Nordic Semiconductor, Oticon, and Bose.  Features  Zephyr intends to provide all components needed to develop resource-constrained and embedded or microcontroller-based applications. This includes, but is not limited to: * A small kernel * A flexible configuration and build system for compile-time definition of required resources and modules * A set of protocol stacks (IPv4 and IPv6, OMA LWM2M, MQTT, 802.15.4, Bluetooth Low Energy, CAN) * A virtual file system interface with several flash file systems for non-volatile storage * Management and device firmware update mechanisms = Configuration and build system = Zephyr uses Kconfig and device tree as its configuration systems, inherited from the Linux kernel but implemented in Python for portability to non-Unix operating systems. The RTOS build system is based on CMake, which allows Zephyr applications to be built on Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows. = Kernel = The kernel offers several features that distinguish it from other small OSes: * Single address space * Multiple scheduling algorithms * Highly configurable and modular for flexibility, with resources defined at compile-time * Memory protection unit (MPU) based protection * Asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP, based on OpenAMP) and symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support = Security = A group is dedicated to maintaining and improving the security. Also, being owned and supported by a community means the world's open source developers are vetting the code, which significantly increases security.

Night of the Tropics), D. 104 (RO 255), is Louis Moreau Gottschalk's first and most well-known symphony. Background The symphony was probably completed in 1858; the first movement, sometimes subtitled La nuit des tropiques, was premiered in Havana during the winter of the following year. Fourteen months later, the full symphony, with the second movement, \\"Une F√™te sous les tropiques\\" (lit. A day in the tropics), was performed at one of Gottschalk's \\"monster concerts\\" with an orchestra of over 600 players, inspired by Berlioz's similar performance venues. The manuscript survived in Havana until 1932, when it was stolen, only to reappear in a New York Public Library in the 1950s. The first premiere in the US was not until 5 May 1955, when Howard Shanet conducted the Columbia University Orchestra with his own arrangement of the score for a smaller orchestra. The symphony was first recorded in 1971, with an edition by Igor Buketoff that called for a total of only 150 players, including a full symphony orchestra, an extra band, and many Afro-Caribbean percussion instruments. Structure The symphony is written in two movements: #Andante #Allegro moderato The first movement, a sublime \\"divine tropical sunset-with- storm,\\" begins and ends with strings, building into an agitated section, where the winds and brass support them before coming back to the opening phrases. It is considered more \\"European\\" than the second movement, which historically is probably the first orchestral setting of a samba. Forty-four measures from the end of the second movement are missing in the manuscript full score; although one conductor suggests this was possibly \\"for the orchestra to improvise in a jazz-like manner\\", this seems highly unlikely with such huge instrumental forces, plus the missing passage survives in a contemporary two-piano arrangement by Gottschalk's Brazilian friend and publisher Arthur Napole√£o dos Santos. A typical performance takes approximately 20 minutes.

Examples of such climate mitigation policies include improved energy efficiency of plants, renewable energy uptake and fuel switching which might enable a range of co- benefits such as air-pollution impacts, technological innovation, energy- supply security through increased energy diversity, reduced fuel cost and employment possibilities. Co-benefits in policy-making Co-benefits of GHG mitigation can be an important decision criteria in analyses carried out by policy-makers, but they are often neglected, and often the co-benefits are not quantified, monetised or even identified by businesses and decision-makers. Appropriate consideration of co-benefits can greatly influence policy decisions concerning the timing and level of mitigation action, and there can be significant advantages to the national economy and technical innovation. Co-benefits in research  Different research groups currently examine the impacts of co-benefits of climate change mitigation. One of these projects is the COBENEFITS project of the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Potsdam, Germany. The COBENEFITS project is part of the International Climate Initiative (IKI). The Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) supports this initiative on the basis of a decision adopted by the German Bundestag. The project is conducted in close collaboration with government ministries, agencies, research institutions, and think tanks as political partners and knowledge partners in the target countries. These four target countries are India, South Africa, Turkey, and Vietnam. The project team, thereby, cooperates with national authorities and knowledge partners to develop key insights that enable them to mobilise these co-benefits in their countries and accelerate domestic processes aimed at achieving their international climate protection commitments.  Main co- benefits  = Active lifestyle = Biking reduces greenhouse gas emissions while reducing the effects of a sedentary lifestyle at the same time According to PLoS Medicine: \\"obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, which are in part related to physical inactivity, may be reduced by a switch to low-carbon transport‚Äîincluding walking and cycling.\\" = Clean air = Climate change mitigation policies can lead to lower emissions of co-emitted air pollutants, for instance by shifting away from fossil fuel combustion. In addition, gases such as black carbon and methane contribute both to global warming and to air pollution, such that their mitigation can bring benefits in terms of limiting global temperature increases as well as improving air quality. Implementation of the climate pledges made in the run-up to the Paris Agreement could therefore have significant benefits for human health by improving air quality.

Due to depictions of the Judeo-Christian God as a little African-American girl, as well as threats of violence against God by the titular Giant, it was challenged or removed from school libraries in Canada. Plot McKeon, the last Giant in Ireland, is upset at Saint Patrick driving out not only the snakes, but also elves, giants, and all the other mythical creatures. In retaliation, McKeon begins throwing church bells into the ocean. Saint Patrick, upset, tells McKeon to take up his issue with God who will be arriving \\"on the Thursday boat\\". McKeon sits down to wait, but the first craft that arrives is a small boat carrying a little girl. Deciding that this cannot be God, McKeon invites her to sit with him as he waits. Other boats arrive, but none of them are carrying God. Upset, he takes the little girl and leaps straight into Heaven. There, he confronts Saint Patrick and the two go searching for God to settle the dispute. Eventually the little girl reveals herself as the Almighty, and states that inside her house there is more than enough room for \\"giants, elves, snakes, saints, and church bells.\\" Reception Although the book has received a reevaluation by modern readers, critics at the time of publication were less kind, with Judith Saltman putting it bluntly \\"This is not one of [Munsch's] better books.\\" Challenges Shortly after the book's publication, several school districts in Ontario, Canada banned the book for use in grades K-3 citing the religious themes, particularly that God was represented as a little girl, as well as McKeon's threats of violence towards God. However, as of early 2016, Giant is not currently listed as a challenged book in Canada.

Naming The shores of the lake are overgrown with pine forest. The name of the lake originates from the word bor, which means \\"pine forest\\". The historical name is Auliekol, which means \\"holy lake\\". The water in the lake is limpid and the bottom can be seen clearly. The water surface of the lake is almost open, only the western and northwestern shores are rushy; the southern shores are rocky, and the eastern shores are sandy. The bottom is flat. The lake has several capes. Near the northwestern cape, there is a rocky mushroom- shaped island, Zhumbaktas (\\"Sphinx\\"), reaching an elevation of above the water. Burabay is separated by mountain ranges from the closest lakes. The cliffs and capes of the northwestern and southern coasts create a unique landscape. The lake is situated within Burabay National Park. The lake water is healing.

The National Forests Small Tracts Act was amended in 2005, and/or 2015). Lou Bellisi of PublicLands.org writes: Small tract land patents were granted by the General Land Office (which merged with the United States Grazing Service in 1946 to form the US Bureau of Land Management). These patents transferred property owned by the U.S. government to private ownership. Like the Homestead Acts before it, the Small Tract Act created many problems. Among them were, according to Bellisi, the As private owners of tracts patented to them by the GLO have subdivided and developed parcels of land, GLO easements continue to create controversy. For example, a recent application to develop land for a charter school in Scottsdale, Arizona sought abandonment by the City of Scottsdale of its municipal interests in a GLO easement through the subject property (which is done without referencing any adjacent property owners' purported rights to the easement). The developer threatened to sue the city if the abandonment was not granted. Previous GLO easement-related controversies have erupted between adjoining private landowners; and between private landowners and municipalities. The City of Scottsdale has stated its position on these issues in many GLO easement abandonment actions by the City Council: The City of Scottsdale does not appear to have a position or policy on the monetary value of its interests in these easements, or the abandonment thereof. Pima County, Arizona has a policy that includes: Scottsdale resident, property owner, and GLO easement activist Leon Spiro has frequently lectured the Scottsdale city council and state agencies in opposition to abandonment of GLO easements. Spiro has argued that the city's abandonment of the city's interest in GLO easements does not abandon the interests of adjacent landowners, for whom the easements were created. Mr. Spiro says, Cave Creek, Arizona attorney Noel Hebets has also opined on these issues.

It is primarily meant for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD), that can be launched from a range of altitudes with large standoff distance for destroying enemy surveillance radars, tracking and communication systems. It is first anti-radiation missile to be developed in India and will be jointly produced by Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) and Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) after trials and introduction.  Description  Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL) is the primary agency which carried out the design and development of the missile system along with Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE), Defence Electronics Research Laboratory (DLRL), High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL), Research Centre Imarat (RCI) and Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory (TBRL). Many subsystem level developmental works were outsourced to private sector players. Software Labs of the Indian Air Force (IAF) helped in the integration of DRDO ARM with Sukhoi Su-30MKI while the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Nasik Division did the AKU-58 launcher modification which undertook extensive wind-tunnel tests at National Trisonic Aerodynamic Facilities (NTAF) division of National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), Bengaluru. DRDO ARM has a range of 100‚Äì250 km which is made to be integrated with Sukhoi Su-30MKI as its primary test platform, although can be used with Dassault Mirage 2000, SEPECAT Jaguar, HAL Tejas and HAL Tejas Mark 2/MWF in future. According to the then Director of Research Centre Imarat (RCI), G. Satheesh Reddy, the missile will feature a millimetre wave seeker (mmW) transmitting on frequencies of 30 Gigahertz (GHz) and above while capable of lock-on before launch and lock-on after launch modes. Mid-course guidance is accomplished through inertial navigation system (INS) combined with GPS/NavIC satellite guidance through digital filtering as fall back to correct accumulated errors and a passive homing head (PHH) seeker which is developed by DLRL that can detect radio frequency emissions from 100 km away. PHH is a wide-band receiver system operating within D band to J band frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum. It's compact front-end structure is due to the use of monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) technology for identification of radiation emitting sources. The missile is a single- stage, approximately 5.5 metre in length and 140 kg of weight with cruciform wing surface to increase high maneuverability and to give constant aerodynamic characteristics similar to Astra BVRAAM. It uses pre-fragmented warhead with optical proximity fuze and is powered by a dual-pulsed solid rocket motor made by Premier Explosives Limited (PEL) under technology transfer from DRDO. The dual-pulsed solid rocket motor produces variable thrust within a range of 0.6 to 2 Mach that reduces the overall reaction time while widening the targeting envelope as well as the engagement capability. DRDO ARM can target mobile integrated air-defence system as well as radar station that shutdown to avoid detection.  Development and trials  Development had begun by April 2012 at Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL). The project was officially approved in December 2012 with a budget of with project completion by 2017. The feasibility studies were done during the period 2012-2013 with the aim is to develop a fully indigenous tactical, anti-radiation capable missile for the Indian Air force (IAF) which is comparable to AGM-88E AARGM, MAR-1, Kh-31P and better than Martel or Kh-25MP. From 2014, the development of missile picked up interest of the IAF. As of 2014, missile design and hardware development are in progress with first successful flight trial to happen before year 2017. IAF was initially very concerned with the higher weight and shorter range of new missile compare to the western ones due to the use of bulky Russian made radio frequency (RF) seekers. IAF at the same time was also negotiating with USA for 1,500 AGM 88E which IAF was planning to induct in the next five years. The technologies that were developed by DRDO for NGARM are wide-band passive seeker, milli-metric wave active seeker, radome for the seekers and dual- pulsed propulsion system which are mostly lessons learnt during the development of Astra and Barak 8. The Captive Flight Trial‚Äì1 (CFT‚Äì1) of DRDO ARM was completed on April/May 2016 by No. 20 Squadron of IAF which checked the performance of seeker, navigation and control system, structural capability and aerodynamic vibrations while the Drop Flight Trial (DFT) was completed by December 2016 with the missile released by Sukhoi Su-30MKI at a speed of 0.8 Mach, from 6.5 km altitude. Further carriage flight test was carried out to check mechanical/electrical integration as well as software interfacing of the missile before the maiden flight on 18 January 2018, where the missile was successfully flight tested for the first time on parametres such as auto-launch sequence, store separation, control guidance, aerodynamics, thermal batteries, airframe and propulsion without a seeker which were all proven successful. On 25 January 2019, NGARM was fired from a Sukhoi Su-30MKI over Bay of Bengal off the coast of Odisha that hit the designated target with a high degree of accuracy. The missile achieved an accuracy within 10 m CEP covering a range of 100 km. The developmental test proved the performance of seeker, structural integrity of the missile, correct functioning of navigation and control system while validation of aerodynamic capability. The missile can strike at distances double the intended range depending upon the altitude. NGARM will further undergo series of carriage and release flight trials to check the performance of seekers against different range of targets. Next trials during the period of July to August 2019 will be conducted initially to check the performance of indigenous passive seeker developed by DLRL with further test for an active seeker at later stage. While the crucial sensor technology is yet to be fully mastered by DRDO, the IAF wants fast track development of NGARM due to urgent requirement of newer anti- radiation missile. NGARM developmental trials will resume from 2020 after a gap of two years. The DRDO Anti-Radiation Missile or NGARM now officially named Rudram-1 was successfully test fired from Integrated Test Range (ITR), Balasore on October 9, 2020. = Future development = DRDO is planning to bring further software improvements to handle a larger variety of targets under various operational conditions while developing a separate ground-based variant to be launched from mobile launcher.
