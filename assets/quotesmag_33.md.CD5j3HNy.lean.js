The RAMnets is also known as a type of \\"n-tuple recognition method\\" or \\"weightless neural network\\". Algorithm Consider (let us say N) sets of n distinct bit locations are selected randomly. These are the n-tuples. The restriction of a pattern to an n-tuple can be regarded as an n-bit number which, together with the identity of the n-tuple, constitutes a \`feature' of the pattern. The standard n-tuple recognizer operates simply as follows: A pattern is classified as belonging to the class for which it has the most features in common with at least one training pattern of that class. '' This is the \\\\Theta= 0 case of a more general rule whereby the class assigned to unclassified pattern u is \\\\begin{align} \\\\underset{c}argmax(\\\\sum_{i=1}^N\\\\Theta(\\\\sum_{v\\\\in D_{c}}\\\\delta(\\\\alpha_{i}(u),\\\\alpha_{i}(v))))\\\\end{align} where Dc is the set of training patterns in class c, \\\\Theta(x)= x for 0\\\\leq x\\\\leq \\\\theta ,\\\\Theta(x)=\\\\theta for x\\\\geq\\\\theta,\\\\delta_{i,j} is the Kronecker delta(\\\\delta_{i,j}=1 if i=j and 0 otherwise.)and (\\\\alpha_{i}(u))is the ith feature of the pattern u: \\\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}u_\\\\eta i(j)2^{j} Here uk is the kth bit of u and u_\\\\eta i (j)is the jth bit location of the ith n-tuple. With C classes to distinguish, the system can be implemented as a network of NC nodes, each of which is a random access memory (RAM); hence the term RAMnet. The memory content m_{ci\\\\alpha} at address \\\\alpha of the ith node allocated to class c is set to m_{ci\\\\alpha} = \\\\Theta(\\\\sum_{v\\\\in D_{c}}\\\\delta(\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha_{i}(v))) In the usual \\\\theta = 1 case, the 1-bit content of m_{ci\\\\alpha} is set if any pattern of Dc has feature \\\\alpha and unset otherwise. Recognition is accomplished by summing the contents of the nodes of each class at the addresses given by the features of the unclassified pattern. That is, pattern u is assigned to class \\\\begin{align} \\\\underset{c}argmax(\\\\sum_{i=1}^N m_{ci\\\\alpha}(u)) \\\\end{align} RAM- discriminators and WiSARD  The RAMnets formed the basis of a commercial product known as WiSARD (Wilkie, Stonham and Aleksander Recognition Device) was the first artificial neural network machine to be patented. A RAM- discriminator consists of a set of one-bit word RAMs with inputs and a summing device (Œ£). Any such RAM-discriminator can receive a binary pattern of X‚ãÖn bits as input. The RAM input lines are connected to the input pattern by means of a biunivocal pseudo-random mapping. The summing device enables this network of RAMs to exhibit ‚Äì just like other ANN models based on synaptic weights ‚Äì generalization and noise tolerance. In order to train the discriminator one has to set all RAM memory locations to 0 and choose a training set formed by binary patterns of X‚ãÖn bits. For each training pattern, a 1 is stored in the memory location of each RAM addressed by this input pattern. Once the training of patterns is completed, RAM memory contents will be set to a certain number of 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs. The information stored by the RAM during the training phase is used to deal with previous unseen patterns. When one of these is given as input, the RAM memory contents addressed by the input pattern are read and summed by Œ£. The number thus obtained, which is called the discriminator response, is equal to the number of RAMs that output 1. r reaches the maximum if the input belongs to the training set. is equal to 0 if no n-bit component of the input pattern appears in the training set (not a single RAM outputs 1). Intermediate values of r express a kind of ‚Äúsimilarity measure‚Äù of the input pattern with respect to the patterns in the training set. A system formed by various RAM-discriminators is called WiSARD. Each RAM-discriminator is trained on a particular class of patterns, and classification by the multi- discriminator system is performed in the following way. When a pattern is given as input, each RAM-discriminator gives a response to that input. The various responses are evaluated by an algorithm which compares them and computes the relative confidence of the highest response (e.g., the difference d between the highest response and the second highest response, divided by the highest response). A schematic representation of a RAM-discriminator and a 10 RAM-discriminator WiSARD is shown in Figure 1.

Plants from Corytoplectus are found in Bolivia, Brazil North, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Mexico Southwest, Peru, Venezuela, in the cloud-forests of the high cordillera. The genus contains c. 12 species. The genus differs from the closely related Alloplectus in having an erect umbellate inflorescence and berries. The type species is C. capitatus. Description Corytoplectus species are herbs or shrubs ranging from 0.5-2 m tall. The stems are erect and subquadrangular, but becoming quadrangular near the top. The fruit is a translucent berry with dark striate (with parallel longitudinal ridges or lines) seeds. The leaves have dark green upper surfaces with veins which are paler. The inflorescences are mostly erect. Etymology According to Rodriques-Flores and Skog, Corytoplectus derives from the Latin (leather pouch) and (pleated or folded). They believe the name to be suitable, because, in profile, the calyces look like pleated leather pouches. However, an alternative view says that rather than deriving from the Latin , the name derives from the Greek (helmet), giving \\"pleated helmet\\".  List of species  * Corytoplectus capitatus (Hook.)

He is now remembered mainly for his work on the treatment of scurvy. Life Born at Ballymoney, County Antrim, 26 April 1726, he was the son of Robert McBride, Presbyterian minister there, and brother of John MacBride; his mother's name before marriage was Boyd. He was educated at the village school, and apprenticed to a local surgeon. Macbride was for a short time surgeon's mate on a hospital ship and surgeon in the navy, and he acquired an acquaintance with the diseases of seamen which he afterwards turned to advantage. After the peace (1748) he attended lectures on anatomy by Alexander Monro primus in Edinburgh, and, going to London, he heard also William Hunter, on the same subject, and William Smellie on midwifery. In 1749 he returned to Ballymoney, but moved to Dublin in 1751. He joined, and read papers before, the Medico- Philosophical Society there (established in 1756), and after the death of Charles Smith in 1762 he became its secretary. Until 1764, when the publication of Experimental Essays made his reputation, Macbride had only a small medical practice. The University of Glasgow created him M.D. 27 November 1764, and he prospered. In the winter of 1776‚Äì7 he began lecturing on medicine in his own house. In December 1767 Macbride made a discovery in the art of tanning, advocating the use of lime water in the process. For this he was, on 31 March 1768, made an honorary member of the Dublin Society, which awarded him a silver medal on 14 April following. The Society of Arts of London subsequently gave him a gold medal. On 14 November 1769 he petitioned the Irish House of Commons for aid in developing his invention, and on 19 Nov. a committee was appointed, which reported favourably; no support seems, however, to have been given. In 1777 Macbride sent over to England by Dr. Morton what was said to be the original of the solemn league and covenant, which he had inherited from his grandfather. In his last years he suffered poor health. He died at his house in Cavendish Row, Dublin, on 28 December 1778; he was buried in St. Audoen's Church there. Works Macbride published: * Experimental Essays, London, 1764; 2nd edit. enlarged, 1767; another edit. 1776. The essay \\"On the Nature and Properties of Fixed Air\\" in it to a some extent anticipated the discoveries of Henry Cavendish. The book contained the first publication of the gas theories of Joseph Black. Macbride combined Black's ideas with those of Sir John Pringle. * Historical Account of the New Method of Treating the Scurvy at Sea, London, 1768. In 1762 Macbride communicated his views on the treatment of scurvy to his friend George Cleghorn, through whom they reached William Hunter and Henry Tone, one of the commissioners for taking care of sick and wounded seamen. Macbride advised the use of fresh wort, as used in brewing, and the Lords of the Admiralty ordered trials. Lemon juice, recommended by James Lind in his Treatise on the Scurvy of 1754, in the end prevailed as a treatment; but Macbride's brother John, who was commander of HMS Jason, made an experiment with the cure in a voyage of 1765‚Äì7, and the ship's surgeon, Alexander Young, sent his journal to Macbride, who published it as an appendix to the Historical Account. Joseph Priestley's award-winning work on soda water and scurvy drew on Macbride's ideas. *Introduction to the Theory and Practice of Physic, London, 1772; 2nd and enlarged edit. Dublin, 1776, 2 vols. This work grew out of his lectures; it was translated into Latin, and published at Utrecht in 1774. He also contributed medical papers to periodicals. His Account of the Improved Method of Tanning Leather was published in Philosophical Transactions for 1778. The Principles of Virtue and Morality was published, Boston, 1796, as part of \\"The Moral Library\\". Family Macbride married, first, on 20 November 1753, Margaret Armstrong; and secondly, on 5 June 1762, Dorcas, widow of George Cumming. He left no issue.

Position In its manifesto the organization stated that sexual minorities want to establish a totalitarian regime that would stifle any dissenting thought, that it is necessary to talk about the discrimination of heterosexuals, and that \\"all dissidents who call homosexuality a sin, amoral behaviour, and perversion are being persecuted, laughed out, penalized, exposed to accusations of \\"intolerance\\".–ú–∞–Ω–∏—Ñ–µ—Å—Ç Further, the manifesto claims that homosexuality is a parasite because it may exist only due to heterosexuals' procreation, that it hates family, and that homosexuality and family are antonyms, and therefore they work for the legalization of gay marriage in order to erode the concept of family. Blogger Anatoly Shariy, who was a member of the Organizing Committee of the movement, stated: \\"The danger is that sometimes skinheads want to join the movement, [our] movement has nothing to do with that...

Its old section is located alongside a small river, Lejre √Ö, approximately from its mouth at Roskilde Fjord. History The Gevninge helmet fragment Gevninge is a small and modern village, but its history dates back to the Iron Age. The earliest indisputable written mention of Gevninge is from 1244, when its name appeared as Gi√¶fning; a source from 1202 may also mention the village. Archaeological finds from the area, including the Gevninge helmet fragment, show evidence of occupation during the Iron Age and Viking Age, from approximately 500 AD to 1000 AD. Gevninge is located north of Lejre, a modern- day town that is believed to have been the seat of the Scylding kings during the Iron and Viking ages. Though Lejre is also on the Lejre √Ö, the river that far south was likely too small for effective navigation. Gevninge may have thus served as the \\"port of Lejre\\", an outpost at which any visitor would have to disembark and pass through on the way to the capital. In the epic Anglo- Saxon poem Beowulf, the titular hero travels to the mead hall, Heorot, the seat of King Hrothgar, on his way to kill the monster Grendel. While the tale is fictional, the anonymous author set the poem in the real world, and Hrothgars seat of Heorot is thought today to have been located at Lejre. Upon disembarking, Beowulf and his men are met with an armed warrior who says his job is to protect the Danish shores; only after Beowulf announces his business is he escorted to Heorot. This has led to speculation that the author of Beowulf may have been familiar with the topography of the region, and imagined his hero disembarking at the site of modern-day Gevninge. For example, working through old maps and the poem of Beowulf, the scholars Gillian Overing and Marijane Osborn passed through Gevninge in an attempt to retrace the journey of Beowulf to Heorot/Lejre as described in the poem. The fragment of a helmet discovered in Gevninge provides evidence of an armed outpost in the Iron Age and Viking Age.

Biography Born in Rome and raised in Umbria, Greta Panettieri began her musical career as a six-year-old playing the violin, the instrument that she studied at Conservatory Francesco Morlacchi of Perugia for the next 10 years. She also studied piano and vocals. In 1994 Greta won a scholarship to attend the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston.http://www.gretasbakerymusic.com/EN/artist/greta%20panettieri.html Instead of going to Boston on scholarship, Panettieri decided to stay in New York City after arriving from Italy. She started singing in several clubs, with different styles, from the most traditional to the most experimental, performing with jazz groups but also Latin music, Funk, R&B;, Electronic music and Bossa nova. Singing different musical genres allowed her to learn both English and Portuguese. In 2004 she founded \\"Greta's Bakery\\", along with Italian pianist Andrea Sammartino, American bassist Mike La Valle.http://edizionicorsare.it/viaggio_in_jazz.html In 2005, after showcasing for several labels, Panettieri signed with Universal Music Group. She began collaborating with composer Phil Galdston, author of songs such as The Last to Know by C√©line Dion and Save the Best for Last by Vanessa L. Williams. In 2007 she was signed by Decca Records (Universal Music Group), working with producer Stewart Lerman. In 2009 Panettieri toured Europe as Joe Jackson's opening act. In 2010, the album \\"The Edge of Everything\\" by Greta's Bakery was released in the US by Decca Records. The same year Greta participated in an international project as a guest vocalist and co-author of Patricia Romania's album Sou Brasileira published by Pony Canyon in Japan.https://www.discogs.com/it/Patricia-Romania-Sou- Brasileira/release/8964563 This experience led Greta to collaborating with Terri Lynn Carrington, Robert Irving III, Paolinho Braga, Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim, Toninho Horta, Nona Hendrix and many more.http://www.edizionicorsare.it/viaggio_in_jazz.html As a solo artist, Greta recorded a live album at ZincBar, a New York jazz club in the heart of the West Village, with Brazilian pianist Cidinho Teixeira, bassist Itaiguara Brandao, drummer Mauricio Zottarelli, and saxophonist Rodrigo Ursaia. The album, \\"Brazilian Nights (Live at ZincBar)\\" was released in 2011 under the Greta's Bakery music label. In 2011, Greta moved back to Italy and started performing in various clubs and festivals including a series of concerts at Umbria Jazz Winter. She began collaborating with Geg√® Telesforo, including many songs on Telesforo's albums Nu Joy (Columbia Records) and Fun Slow Ride published by Ropeadope 2016.

The atmospheres of this work retain two timeless feelings: on the one hand the nocturnal, suffused and golden world of jazz; on the other, the mood of Italian songwriting between the '60s and' 70s. In 2014, Greta sang with Sergio Cammariere on three tracks of his album entitled Mano Nella Mano (RCA Records).https://www.discogs.com/it/Sergio-Cammariere-Mano- Nella-Mano/release/8159287 In 2015, Greta was featured in 4 episodes of the Italian national RAI radio show \\"Radio 2 Social Club\\" as \\"la ragazza del club\\" next to Luca Barbarossa.

She died in 2016, at an estimated age of 43 years, and is the longest-lived spider recorded to date. Number 16 did not die of old age, but was most likely killed by a parasitic wasp sting. Long-term monitoring Number 16 was born in 1974, and was studied in the wild by arachnologist Barbara York Main from March 1974 until 2016. She was part of the first cohort of dispersing spiderlings to establish a burrow at the study site, and her burrow was the 16th to be marked with a peg. By 1978, Main had tagged 101 burrows at the study site, within a few metres of each other. Number 16 spent her entire life in the same burrow, which is typical for her species. For over 40 years, her status was monitored by Main and her collaborators either six-monthly or annually. As Number 16 became older, the researchers developed a tradition of always checking her burrow first when they visited the site. Death On 31 October 2016, researcher Leanda Mason discovered Number 16's burrow in disrepair, and the spider missing.Avi Selk (2018) \\"The extraordinary life and death of the world‚Äôs oldest known spider\\" The Washington Post, 1 May 2018. Accessed 2 May 2018. The silk plug of her burrow had been pierced by a parasitic spider wasp, suggesting that she had been parasitised, either before or after death. During a survey six months earlier, Number 16 had been alive. ‚ÄúShe was cut down in her prime [...] It took a while to sink in, to be honest,\\" said Mason. The spider's death received widespread publicity in late April 2018, with the publication of a research article in the journal Pacific Conservation Biology. Based on the burrow fidelity of females of her species, the researchers concluded with a \\"high level of certainty\\" that Number 16 was 43 years old at the time of her death.

First pioneer, then a fighter pilot of the Dai-Nippon Teikoku Kaigun K≈çk≈´ Hombu, the aeronautical service of the Japanese Imperial Navy. During the Second World War, he commanded numerous air units, participating in the Guadalcanal Campaign. In August 1944 he assumed command of the Imperial Navy forces present on the island of Iwo Jima, finding his death in combat against the US Marines on March 26, 1945.  Biography  Rinosuke Ichimaru was born in Karatsu (Prefecture of Saga) on 20 September 1891. He graduated on 31 March 31 1910 to enter the Etajima Naval Academy that same year. He finished his studies on December 19, 1913 ranking 46th out of 118 cadets, earning the rank of Ensign. He then embarked on the armored cruiser Azuma. On 11 August 1914, he started serving the battle cruiser Kong≈ç. On 24 October, he was transferred to the armored cruiser Izumo. Rinosuke Ichimaru was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant on 1 December 1914. On May 26, 1915, he was assigned again to the armored cruiser Azuma, remaining on board until September 1, 1916, when he was switched back to the Kong≈ç again. On 1 December 1916, he began to attend basic course at the naval artillery school. On 1 June 1917, he started to study torpedoes. Passionate about the world of aviation, Rinosuke started to attend the course for pilots students of the Japanese Imperial Navy on 1 December 1917. On 1 January 1918 he was assigned as a military fighter pilot to the Yokosuka-based Air Group. On September 25, 1919 Rinosuke was transferred to the boarded air group, destined to operate by the new H≈çsh≈ç aircraft carrier. On 1 December he was promoted to Lieutenant and became an instructor at the Yokosuka Air Group. 4 years later, on 1 December 1923, he was placed in charge of the Omura Aircraft Group. He was later transferred to the Kasumigaura Aircraft Group on 7 January 1925. On 1 December of the same year he was appointed to the rank of Lieutenant Commander. = Flight Instructor = In July 1926, during a test flight on a fighter, he was involved in an accident that caused him serious fractures to the femur and other injuries to both the skull and the face. He took a long time to recover : according to the testimony of his daughter, Haruko Ichimaru, he spent three years recovering from his surgery until rehabilitation. However, he kept a limp all his life from this incident. During his recovery, he read many books, painted pictures and wrote poetry in Japanese and Chinese classic style, and became famous in poetry. On 1 December 1927 he returned to active service as an instructor at the Kasumigaura flight school. He then returned to Yokosuka in November 1929, where on 1 December 1930 he was promoted to Commander and became an official instructor. Three years later, on 1 December 1933, he became an executive officer at the Sasebo Air Group and on 1 November 1934, he was joined to the General Staff of the 1st Aircraft Division. On May 25, 1935, still as an executive officer, he was boarded on the Kaga aircraft carrier. = Second Sino-Japanese War and Second World War = On 15 October 1935, Rinosuke Ichimaru was assigned to the Chinkai Guard District in Korea, where he later took command of the Air Group on October 1, 1936. Exactly two months later, he was elevated to the rank of Captain. The Second Sino-Japanese war broke out, and 4 months later on November 15, 1937, he became commander of the Yokohama Air Group. He held this position for only one month, being transferred on December 15 to the 1st Naval District where he took command. On 1 April 1939 he was transferred to take command of the Chichi Jima Aircraft Group. On 6 November he changed units again and was placed in command of the 13th Air Group. He then participated in the war on the Asian continent, coordinating the bombing of the city of Wuhan. On November 15, 1940 he moved to the Suzuka Air Group and on 1 May 1942 he was promoted to the rank of Rear-Admiral. Sent into the war theater of the South Pacific Ocean, he took part in the battle of the Eastern Solomon and the subsequent fighting of the long and exhausting campaign of Guadalcanal, in command of the 1st Attack Force. The force suffered heavy losses. On September 1, 1942, he assumed command of the 21st Air Flotilla, but in 1943 he was recalled to Japan, where on November 15 he became commander of the 13th airborne group. On 5 August 1944 he was transferred to the General Staff of the 3rd Air Fleet and on the 10th he took command of the 27th Air Flotilla based on the island of Iwo Jima, south of the metropolitan archipelago. = Battle of Iwo Jima = Admiral Ichimaru landed on the island on August 10 and replaced Rear Admiral Teiichi Matsunaga who was in disagreement with the garrison commander, General Tadamichi Kuribayashi about the defensive strategy to be adopted. In the days that followed, 2,126 sailors, aviators and marines were placed under his orders. When all the planes of his flotilla were lost in the preliminary US bombing, he decided to place his troops under the command of Kuribayashi. Ichimaru did not share the defensive strategy of Kuribayashi, which included a defense in depth. The admiral would have preferred to immediately counter the landings, fighting on the beaches and defending the airfield of Minamiburaki. Despite the differences of opinion with the commander in chief, the men of Ichimaru actively collaborated in the defense and built 135 casemates. When the US landings began on February 19, Ichimaru led 7,347 imperial navy men. On March 17, towards the end of the battle, he was believed to have been killed, and was promoted to the posthumous rank of Vice Admiral. However, he was still alive and the following day he led a desperate attack at the head of the last sixty Marines and still survived. Admiral Ichimaru is believed to have been killed by a barrage of machine gun on March 26, while trying to abandon the cave in which he had taken refuge. On his body was found a letter he had written a few days before and addressed to US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in which Ichimaru justified the decision of the Japanese government to enter the war as a reaction to the policy put in place by the United States that forced Japan on the offensive. The letter was published in the New York Herald Tribune on 11 July and is today kept at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. = Ichimaru's Katana = Photograph of Ichimaru and his sword During the battle, the admiral wore his family sword, an excellent blade from the Edo period. According to the testimony of his daughter Haruko, the sword had saved his life three times in the past. The first was when he was on board a plane, and got hit by a bullet that bounced off the bottom of the sword, therefore saving him. The blade was broken but Ichimaru had it repaired by a specialized blacksmith. During the fighting at Iwo Jima, he always kept his sword with him, but when his body was identified at the end of the attack, it had been taken. There was no news about the katana and in the agitation of the battle, the body of the admiral was lost, as was that of General Kuribayashi. Twenty years after the battle, many books on Iwo Jima were published in the United States. One of these, Iwo Jima by Richard F. Newcomb, published in New York in 1965, included an annotation on the sword of Ichimaru. A history professor, who had participated in the war, read the book and suspected that the sword he had bought for $25 as a war souvenir in New Jersey many years ago was that of the admiral. He carried out further research to identify the sword, and discovered that it was indeed the sword of Ichimaru. It was brought back to Japan by a Japanese war veteran who was visiting New York. The NHK TV organized a meeting that allowed the sword to be returned to the admiral's wife, Sueko. She donated the sword to the Karatsu Castle museum for public exhibition. Unfortunately, the museum was robbed and the sword was stolen along with other objects on display. Sueko died shortly after the robbery. About three years later a doctor bought a sword at an antique shop and, noticing its uniqueness, had it examined. The weapon was identified as the sword of Ichimaru and was returned to the family, where it is still located today.  In popular culture  Ichimaru is portrayed in Clint Eastwood's film Letters From Iwo Jima (2006). He is played by actor Masashi Nagadoi.

The group is based in Annapolis, Maryland. History In December 2016, the organisation announced that Robert Stanton, former director of the National Park Service, and Anne Scott, a philanthropic investment manager, had joined the board of directors, replacing outgoing board members Patrick Noonan, Stephen Adkins and Lloyd Beatty, Jr. =Board of directors= *President and CEO: Joel E.

Stek Projects =High-Resolution Land Cover= Chesapeake Conservancy used topographical mapping to create the Chesapeake Bay High-Resolution Land Cover Project, a high-resolution map of natural and man-made objects spanning the bay's 64,000 square mile watershed. Initially a small-scale pilot program, using mapping to update the United States Geological Survey's existing land-change model of the bay, the Conservancy subsequently formed a partnership with the University of Vermont and WorldView Solutions to extrapolate the method to the whole bay. The map has square meter resolution, substantially improving the previous 30-square- meter resolution data. The data was then converted into a web-based application for public use, released in late 2016, allowing those involved in conservation of the bay to locate optimal locations for tree buffers and other measures aimed at reducing soil and nutrient pollution in the bay's watershed. The Conservancy refers to this method as \\"precision conservation\\". The Chesapeake Bay Program then combined the mapping data with land use data from the area to inform other conservation measures and attempts to improve land use, as well as monitoring water pollution. Chesapeake Conservancy also developed other applications to combine with different kinds of data, such as municipal stormwater reports. In 2014, the Conservancy received a grant from Microsoft, as well as access to their Azure cloud computing service, which drastically increased the speed of the web-based application. A deep neural network model developed by Chesapeake Conservancy and Microsoft allowed the data used in creating the map to be updated at more frequent intervals, which will allow researchers to track changes such as deforestation, urbanization, and the impact of climate change. In 2018, Chesapeake Conservancy was awarded $1.1 million from the Environmental Protection Agency to support its land cover project and to expand a pilot program that maps how water moves across the landscape. The land cover project uses aerial images and computer programming to identify natural and man-made objects across the watershed. Updating the previous 2013/14 land cover dataset to more recent years, aids states, counties and local jurisdictions to see how development shapes the watershed over time. To map how water moves across the land, the Conservancy uses existing United States Geological Survey lidar data, which is collected by a plane bouncing a laser to the ground to collect the height of objects. Combining this information with the updated land cover map will help to precisely locate areas where restoration projects will be the most efficient. =Return of Native American land= In 2017, the conservancy worked with former Virginia Senator John Warner to return an area of land adjacent to the Rappahannock River to the Rappahannock Native Americans who had been forcibly moved from the area in the 17th century. Champions of the Chesapeake Each year, the organization gives out Champions of the Chesapeake awards to recognize individuals for their contribution to conservation of the bay, its environment, and its resources. In 2017 the award was given to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan. In 2018 the award was given to Ecosystem Investment Partners, The Conservation Fund, and The Department of Defense‚Äôs Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration (REPI) program.

Princess Marie √âlisabeth Louise of Cro√ø (26 November 1875 - 20 June 1968) was a member of the Belgian aristocracy and a member of the Belgian Resistance during two world wars.  Early life  Princess Marie was born in London, the daughter of Prince Alfred Emmanuel de Cro√ø and his wife Elizabeth Mary Parnell. Her brother, Prince R√©ginald of Cro√ø, was also involved in anti-German activities during the First World War.  First World War  When the First World War broke out in 1914, the princess was visiting a friend, Violet Cavendish-Bentinck, at the home of her mother, Mrs Louisa Scott; she immediately set out for France. She worked as a nurse, at the family home of Chateau de Bellignies, which was in use as a hospital, and assisted Edith Cavell in helping allied servicemen to escape to Britain via the Netherlands. For this she was arrested in 1915 along with Nurse Cavell and a number of others, but escaped the death penalty. At their trial in October, she asked for clemency for her fellow prisoners, claiming that she and her brother were solely responsible. She was condemned to ten years' hard labour, and sent to a prison at Siegburg in Germany. The Kaiser, Wilhelm II, offered to free her, but she declined because she did not want to be given preferential treatment. In 1917 the princess was admitted to hospital in Bonn, her health seriously affected by prison conditions. She was finally released on 13 November 1918. The Canadian journalist Elizabeth Montizambert, who had been in the occupied territory during the war, became a close friend of Marie and her brother.  Later life  During the Second World War, the princess was again involved in Resistance activities. Henri Giraud, who had been assisted by Nurse Cavell's team when he was a junior officer, once again received Princess Marie's help when he escaped from K√∂nigstein Castle in 1942. She was arrested at Lille. In recognition of her war service, she was awarded the honours of Chevalier of the Order of Leopold and of the L√©gion d'honneur. She wrote a memoir of her war experiences, titled War Memories, which was published by Macmillan in 1932. She did not marry, and died at Saint- Benin-d'Azy, aged 92.

The post-war period saw several short-lived or ill-fated initiatives for European defence integration intended to protect against potential Soviet or German aggression: The Western Union and the proposed European Defence Community were respectively cannibalised by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and rejected by the French Parliament. The largely dormant Western European Union (WEU) succeeded the Western Union's remainder in 1954. In 1970 the European Political Cooperation (EPC) brought about the European Communities' initial foreign policy coordination, which in turn was replaced by the newly founded EU's CFSP pillar in 1993. The WEU was reactivated in 1984 and given new tasks, and in 1996 NATO agreed to let it develop a European Security and Defence Identity (ESDI).https://eur- lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/european_security_defence_identity.html The 1998 St. Malo declaration signalled that the traditionally hesitant United Kingdom was prepared to provide the EU with autonomous defence structures.https://euobserver.com/foreign/138147 This facilitated the transformation of the ESDI into the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) in 1999, when it was transferred to the EU. In 2003 the EU deployed its first CSDP missions, and adopted the European Security Strategy identifying common threats and objectives. In 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon introduced the present name, CSDP, while establishing the EEAS, the mutual defence clause and enabling a subset of member states to pursue defence integration within PESCO. In 2011 the WEU, whose tasks had been transferred to the EU, was dissolved. In 2016 a new security strategy was introduced, which along with the Russian annexation of Crimea, the scheduled British withdrawal from the EU and the election of Trump as US President have given the CSDP a new impetus. Background =1945 ‚Äì 1950: From Franco-British alliance to Western Union= On 4 March 1947 France and the United Kingdom signed the Treaty of Dunkirk for mutual assistance in the event of a possible German or Soviet attack in the aftermath of World War II. The treaty entered into force on 8 September 1947. In March 1948 the Treaty of Dunkirk was in essence succeeded by Article 4 of the Treaty of Brussels, to which the Benelux countries were also party. In September the same year the Western Union (WU), also referred to as the Brussels Treaty Organisation (BTO), was established to implement the Treaty of Brussels, with an allied European command structure under British Field Marshal Montgomery. The military arm of the WU was referred to as the Western Union Defence Organisation (WUDO). File:Pact van Brussel.

WUDO could also be compared with the defence organisation in the United Kingdom. =1950 ‚Äì 1952: NATO cannibalises the Western Union= Eisenhower, who served as Supreme Allied Commander Europe, depicted on 8 October 1951 in front of the flag of NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE). WUDO's plans, structures and responsibility of defending Western Europe were transferred to SHAPE. When the division of Europe into two opposing camps became considered unavoidable, the threat of the USSR became much more important than the threat of German rearmament. Western Europe, therefore, sought a new mutual defence pact involving the United States, a powerful military force for such an alliance. The United States, concerned with containing the influence of the USSR, was responsive. Secret meetings began by the end of March 1949 between American, Canadian and British officials to initiate the negotiations that led to the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty on 4 April 1949 in Washington, DC. The need to back up the commitments of the North Atlantic Treaty with appropriate political and military structures led to the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). In December 1950, with the appointment of General Eisenhower as the first Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), the members of the Treaty of Brussels decided to transfer the headquarters, personnel, and plans of the Western Union Defence Organisation (WUDO) to NATO.Hansard extract February 18, 1957 NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) took over responsibility for the defence of Western Europe, while the physical headquarters in Fontainebleau were transformed into NATO's Headquarters, Allied Forces Central Europe (AFCENT). As WUDO's capacities were transferred to NATO's SHAPE, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery resigned as Commanders-in-Chief Committee Chairman on 31 March 1951 and took the position of deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) on 1 April 1951. The establishment of NATO, along with the signing of a succession of treaties establishing the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (April 1948), the Council of Europe (May 1949) and the European Coal and Steel Community (April 1951), left the Western Union and its founding Treaty of Brussels was left devoid of much of its authority. =1952 ‚Äì 1954: The European Defence Community fails= Since the end of World War II, West Germany had been occupied by Allied forces and lacked its own means of defense. On 23 July 1952, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) came into existence, bonding the member states economically. By 1951, fear of possible Soviet aggression in Europe, as well as the Pleven plan, proposed in 1950 by then French Prime Minister Ren√© Pleven in response to the American call for the rearmament of West Germany, led France, West Germany, Italy and the Benelux ‚Äì the Inner six of European integration ‚Äì to propose a scheme that was similar in nature to the ECSC but concerned defence; the European Defense Community (EDC). The EDC would have consisted of a pan-European military divided into national components, with a common budget, common institutions, common arms and centralised procurement. At the time, this was favoured over admitting Germany to NATO. The General Treaty () of 1952 formally named the EDC as a prerequisite of the end of Allied occupation of Germany. The EDC founding treaty did not enter into force, however, as it failed to obtain approval for ratification on 30 August 1954 in the French National Assembly where Gaullists feared for national sovereignty and Communists opposed a European military consolidation that could rival the Soviet Union. File:Organisation of the European Defence Community.svgOrganisational chart planned for the EDC File:European Army.jpgPlanned distribution of EDC divisions, as illustrated in Time Magazine in 1952 File:Rene Pleven.jpgFrench Prime Minister Ren√© Pleven (1951) =1954 ‚Äì 1970: A dormant WEU is established= The failure to establish the EDC resulted in the 1954 amendment of the Treaty of Brussels at the London and Paris Conferences which in replacement of EDC established the political Western European Union (WEU) out of the Western Union. While the WEU was not as broad or powerful as the previously proposed EDC, it was nevertheless sufficient for the Deutschlandvertrag to come into force and therefore to end the occupation of West Germany, give it full sovereignty and admit it as an ally in the Cold War, both in the WEU and NATO. Italy was also admitted in these organisations. From this point defence aims had shifted to the Soviet Union. On a sidenote, had the 1955 referendum on the Saar statute, held in the Saar Protectorate, not failed, territory would have become an independent polity under the auspices of a European Commissioner, to be appointed by the Council of Ministers of the Western European Union, while remaining in the economic union with France.Results of the referendum on the Saar Statute CVCE Its rejection by voters was taken as an indication that they would rather reunite with West Germany.Rearmament and the European Defense Community Library of Congress Country Studies On 27 October 1956, France and West Germany concluded the Saar Treaty establishing that Saarland should be allowed to join West Germany as provided by article 23 of its constitution (Grundgesetz), so Saarland became a state of Germany with effect from 1 January 1957. On 1 January 1960, in accordance with a decision taken on 21 October the previous year by the Council of Western European Union and with Resolution(59)23 adopted on 16 November 1959 by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, the WEU activities in social and cultural areas (Social Committee, Public Health Committee, Joint Committee on the Rehabilitation and Resettlement of the Disabled and Cultural Committee) were transferred to the Council of Europe, which was already running programmes in these fields. The European Universities Committee (see CM(60)4; C(59)127 and CM(59)130) was transferred to the Council of Europe separately from the rest of WEU cultural activities.https://www.coe.int/en/web/documents-records-archives- information/timeline-1948#{\\"19133186\\":[0]} =1970 ‚Äì 1984: Initial co- ordination of EC foreign policy= In the wake of the EDC's failure, Charles de Gaulle proposed the Fouchet Plan in 1961, which would have created a more intergovernmentally oriented \\"Union of European Peoples\\", with a common defence policy. The Fouchet Plan was met with scepticism among the other member states of the European Communities, and never implemented. In 1970 the European Political Cooperation (EPC) was introduced as an initial coordination of foreign policy within the European Communities (EC). The involvement of the United Kingdom guaranteed its Atlanticist nature. Although the EPC was mainly intergovernmental, the European Commission would be able to express its opinion if matters within its competencies were concerned. The EPC was amended and strengthened in the so-called Copenhagen and London reports in 1973 and 1981, respectively, and codified (formalised) in 1986 with the Single European Act. Although the EPC enhanced the European Communities' role on the international scene during the 1970s, notably in the Middle East conflict and in the creation of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, it was considered a mixed success. =1984 ‚Äì 1998: WEU revived, EU established= From the late 1970s onwards, efforts were made to add a security dimension to the EC's EPC. Opposition to these efforts from Denmark, Greece and Ireland led the remaining EC countries - all WEU members - to reactivate the WEU by means of the 1984 Rome Declaration.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/news/06/0616/jargon.shtml Following the European Communities' 1986 Single European Act, which codified the EPC in EU law contained little of substance on EC defence integration, the WEU member states adopted the Platform on European Security Interests, which emphasised the need for intra-European defence integration and strengthening of NATO's European pillar. In 1992, the WEU adopted the Petersberg Declaration, defining the so-called Petersberg tasks designed to cope with the possible destabilising of Eastern Europe. The WEU itself had no standing army but depended on cooperation between its members. Its tasks ranged from the most modest to the most robust, and included Humanitarian, rescue and peacekeeping tasks as well as tasks for combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking.EUROPA ‚Äì Glossary ‚Äì Petersberg tasks Upon the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, the European Union was established, consisting of three pillars, of which the first was the European Communities, one was the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) - a replacement of the European Communities' EPC - and the last was the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA). The CFSP pillar became a natural basis for a further deepening of EU defence policy cooperation. At the 1996 NATO ministerial meeting in Berlin, it was agreed that the WEU would oversee the creation of a European Security and Defence Identity (ESDI) within NATO structures.NATO Ministerial Meetings Berlin ‚Äì 3‚Äì4 June 1996 The ESDI was intended as a European 'pillar' within NATO, partly to allow European countries to act militarily where NATO wished not to, and partly to alleviate the United States' financial burden of maintaining military bases in Europe, which it had done since the Cold War. The Berlin agreement allowed European countries (through the WEU) to use NATO assets if it so wished. File:Petersberg-077.JPGHotel Petersberg, where the Petersberg tasks were defined in 1992.

This marked a turning point as the declaration endorsed the creation of a European security and defense policy, including a European military force capable of autonomous action. The declaration was a response to the Kosovo War in the late 1990s, in which the EU was perceived to have failed to intervene to stop the conflict. Following the establishment of the ESDI and the St. Malo declaration, US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright were among others who voiced concern that an independent European security pillar could undermine NATO, as she put forth the three famous D's: As a direct consequence of the Saint-Malo summit, the EU formulated a \\"Headline Goal\\" in Helsinki in 1999, setting 2003 as a target date for the creation of a European force of up to 60,000 troops, and establishing a catalogue of forces, the 'Helsinki Force Catalogue', to be able to carry out the so-called \\"Petersberg Tasks\\". Javier Solana, who served as High Representative between 1999 and 2009 The Treaty of Amsterdam, which entered into force in 1999, transferred the WEU's Petersberg tasks to the EU, and stated that the EU's European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), replacing the WEU's ESDI, would be 'progressively framed' on the basis of these tasks. In June 1999, the Cologne European Council decided to incorporate the role of the WEU within the EU, effectively abandoning the WEU. The Cologne Council also appointed Javier Solana as the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy to help progress both the CFSP and the ESDP. In 2000 and 2001 a number of ESDP bodies were established within the EU Council, including the Political and Security Committee (PSC), the Military Committee (EUMC) and the Military Staff (EUMS). In 2002 the European Union Satellite Centre superseded the Western European Union Satellite Centre, and the 1996 Berlin agreement was amended with the so-called Berlin Plus agreement, which allowed the EU to also draw on some of NATO's assets in its own peacekeeping operations, subject to a \\"right of first refusal\\" in that NATO must first decline to intervene in a given crisis. Additionally, an agreement was signed on information sharing between the EU and NATO, and EU liaison cells were addet at NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) and Joint Force Command (JFC) in Naples. In 2003 the Treaty of Nice entered into force, providing the ESDP's legal foundation in terms of competences, organisation, structures and assets. The same year the ESDP became operational through its first missions and operations, and the EU adopted its European Security Strategy, outlining common threats and objectives.\\"European security strategy\\", SCADPLUS, September 4, 2006 The European security strategy was for the first time drawn up in 2003 under the authority of the EU's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, and adopted by the Brussels European Council of 12 and 13 December 2003. With the emergence of the ESDP, it was the first time that Europe had formulated a joint security strategy. It could be considered a counterpart to the National Security Strategy of the United States. It became clear that the objectives of the outlined in the Helsinki Headline Goal were not achievable quickly. In May 2004, EU defence ministers approved \\"Headline Goal 2010\\", extending the timelines for the EU's projects. However, it became clear that the objectives cannot be achieved by this date too. French Foreign Minister Alain Jupp√© espressed his desperation: \\"The common security and defense policy of Europe? It is dead.\\"Meltem Mueftueler-Bac & Damla Cihangir, \\"The Transatlantic Relationship and the Future Global Governance\\", European Integration and Transatlantic Relations, (2012), p 12, www.iai.it/pdf/Transworld/TW_WP_05.pdf In 2004 the European Defence Agency (EDA) was established to facilitate defence integration. Irish Army personnel from the EU's Nordic Battle Group at an exercise in 2010: No battle group has as of yet been deployed The Helsinki Headline Goal Catalogue is a listing of rapid reaction forces composed of 60,000 troops managed by the European Union, but under control of the countries who deliver troops for it. In 2005 the EU Battlegroups (BG) initiative was operational as a result of the Helsinki Headline Goal process. Each battlegroup were to quickly be able to deploy about 1,500 personnel. Since the inception of the EU's European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) in 1999 (renamed the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, in 2009), missions had only ad hoc OHQs. The United Kingdom, in particular, had blocked moves towards establishing a permanent EU OHQ that could duplicate or undermine the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) Allied Command Operations (ACO) - and its SHAPE headquarters in Mons, Belgium. As of 2017, CSDP missions had the following ad hoc OHQ options, from which the Council would choose: *OHQs offered by member states, e.g. Northwood Headquarters as made available by the United Kingdom *Allied Command Operations (ACO) of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), based on the Berlin Plus agreement *European Union Operations Centre (EU OPCEN), a limited ad hoc headquarters outside the EEAS 2009 ‚Äì 2015: Deeper cooperation enabled, WEU dissolved Signing of the Treaty of Lisbon (2007) Upon the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 the ESDP was renamed the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), a mutual defence clause was introduced among member states and a subset of willing member states fulfilling 'higher criteria' were allowed to pursue Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). The post of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy also superseded the two previous posts of High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and European Commissioner for External Relations. The treaty also led to the dissolution of the Western European Union in 2011 as, with the solidarity clause (deemed to supersede the WEU's military mutual defence clause) and the expansion of the CSDP, the WEU became redundant. 2015 ‚Äì present: New political impetus, structural integration The mutual defence clause, Article 42.7, was invoked for the first time in November 2015 following the terrorist attacks in Paris, which were described by French President Fran√ßois Hollande as an attack against Europe as a whole. In 2016 HR/VP Federica Mogherini drew up a new security strategy, the European Union Global Strategy, which along with the Russian annexation of Crimea, the scheduled British withdrawal from the EU and the election of Donald Trump as US President have given the CSDP a new impetus. This has given rise to a number of initiatives: *Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO; 2017‚Äì) *Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD; 2019-) *European Defence Fund (EDF; 2017) *Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC; 2017) *Directorate-General for Defence Industry and Space (2019-) The MPCC is a part of the External Action Service's Military Staff (EUMS) that constitutes the EU's first permanent operational headquarters. The Director General of the EUMS also serves as Director of the MPCC - exercising command and control over the operations within the MPCC's remit.

As of 2020, he is a member of Donegal County Council, representing the Milford Electoral Area. Electoral history O'Donnell's father Eddie was also a county councillor. Eddie O'Donnell was killed in a car accident in 1993. John O'Donnell first stood as a candidate at the 2014 Donegal County Council election. With ten seats available, O'Donnell finished in third position ‚Äì behind Ciaran Brogan and ahead of Ian McGarvey (both electoral veterans). At the 2019 Donegal County Council election, he again finished a head of McGarvey. O'Donnell ran as a candidate in the Donegal constituency at the 2020 general election, finishing in seventh place behind Pat \\"the Cope\\" Gallagher in the five-seat constituency, and ahead of fellow independent candidate and former presidential hopeful Peter Casey. RT√â Investigates programme O'Donnell was one of three politicians secretly filmed for Standards in Public Office, which aired on RT√â One straight after the Nine O'Clock News on 8 December 2015. For the purposes of its programme, RT√â established an imaginary company it named Vinst Opportunities, with imaginary investors searching for ways to set up wind farms without having to deal with any problems that might arise if the imaginary company and its imaginary investors sought planning permission. Discovering that ‚Äì five times over the previous four years ‚Äì companies belonging to him had come to the attention of Revenue for their use of unmarked diesel and under-declaring of income, RT√â contacted O'Donnell and claimed he \\"did not hesitate when asked to meet with the company\\". O'Donnell met with the imaginary representative of the imaginary company, who secretly filmed him offering to find either an established wind farm or land that could be bought, and that he would assist in lobbying his fellow members of Donegal County Council to support wind farms, which RT√â described as \\"extremely controversial in many rural areas\\". O'Donnell told the imaginary company representative: \\"I am a developer myself. I am a businessman. I am not a negative person. I like to see things going forward, progress, like ... and eh ... there's some members of Donegal County Council who would be the completely opposite ... I have done it before on other stuff ... within the council, I would have probably ‚Äì there's 37 [councilors] there, I would certainly have 25 to 30 that are always nearly with me ... you know what I mean ... Because they know I am a populist, like I use common sense ... I am a realist ... you know what I mean? Anything that I would be bringing forward normally, it stacks up.\\" When the imaginary representative asked what the imaginary company would have to do for him to support it, O'Donnell said the company should pay a middle-man who would then pay him, while ‚Äì O'Donnell said ‚Äì \\"I will be working, I will be working for them tirelessly at the coal face within the council.\\" O'Donnell also expressed concerns that his involvement with the imaginary company would lead to a situation whereby \\"for me politically there would be a backlash. You know the way people are ... so many begrudgers out there, it's not even funny.\\" In April 2018, the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO) announced that O'Donnell would face an ethics hearing on 11 September as part of its response to the programme. In March 2019, the Commission announced it had found against O'Donnell, stating that he \\"conflated his roles as councilor and businessman and used his position as councilor in order to promote his private interests as a businessman\\" and breached the Local Government Act on three occasions, including not having \\"regard to and be guided by the Code of Conduct for Councillors\\". Arrest and trial On 4 July 2016, O'Donnell was arrested at New Line Road in Letterkenny. He appeared in court later that month on two counts of assaulting two men on 23 February 2015, one at a bus stop in Gortlee, Letterkenny, and the other at a kebab and pizza takeaway elsewhere in the town. O'Donnell went on trial in December 2018. The judge instructed the jury to find O'Donnell \\"not guilty\\" on the charge of assault at the takeaway. He said the issue regarding the charge at the bus stop was not whether O'Donnell had struck the man but whether he was acting in self-defence. The prosecution barrister said O'Donnell punched and kicked the man's face, fracturing his nasal bones and causing him to spend eight days in hospital and to require surgery.

Vasilija Vukotiƒá was born in ƒåevo in 1897. She was the only daughter and the eldest of two children of Serdar Janko Vukotiƒá. Belonging to the Vukotiƒá brotherhood, she was related to Petar and Milena Vukotiƒá. She took part in the First Balkan War, the Second Balkan War, and World War I, until the fall of the Montenegrin army and state in 1916. She was the only woman to participate in the Battle of Mojkovac. When World War I broke out, Vasilija‚Äôs brother Vuka≈°in, who was twelve years her junior, was not yet old enough to fight. As Vasilija already had some military experience, her father gave her the rank of corporal. She personally transmitted his orders to military units and their commanders. As she was the only woman, and none other than the Serdar‚Äôs daughter, she was well-loved by the soldiers, especially for her daring, honor and courage. She took part in the Battle of Mojkovac, in which the Montenegrin army defended the retreat of the Serbian army, moving towards northern Albania. Having survived the battle, she left a detailed account of the moments of heroism and tragedy: ‚ÄúIf it were not for that bloody Christmas at Mojkovac, there would not have been Easter in Kajmakchalan. Had it not been for the Montenegrin eagles, those young men, who scorned death and closed the doors of Mojkovac with their own bosoms and stopped the enemy army from reaching the Serbian rear, perhaps the fate of the Serbs would have been sealed for good‚Ä¶‚Äù She died in Belgrade in 1970.

Goodwin contributed ground-breaking theory and research on social interaction and opened new pathways for research on eye gaze, storytelling, turn-taking and action. Biography Goodwin worked in the field of social welfare before entering academia. He was a caseworker for the New York City Department of Welfare, and a filmmaker for the Developmental Center for Autistic Children in Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic. After receiving a BS in English from Holy Cross, and a law degree from New York University School of Law, Charles Goodwin was awarded his doctorate in linguistics in 1977 by the University of Pennsylvania, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. From that point on he made contributions to the field of interactional linguistics, (sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology). He and his wife, Marjorie Harness Goodwin, collectively and individually opened up avenues of inquiry in interaction. His UCLA page lists his interests in \\"Human Action, Video Analysis of Embodied Talk in Interaction, Distributed Cognition, Aphasia in Discourse, Gesture, Ethnography of Science.\\" After leaving Philadelphia, Goodwin taught anthropology at the University of South Carolina before he and his wife both became instructors at UCLA, he in the Communications Department, and she in the Anthropology Department. His commitment to colleagues and to scientific inquiry is made manifest in the organizations of which he was a member: the American Anthropological Association, the American Association for Applied Linguistics, the Society for Linguistic Anthropology, the International Pragmatics Association, the Society for Visual Anthropology and the Committee on Computing as a Cultural Process. With close to 49 years of publications and scores of books, chapters and articles to his name, Goodwin pushed the understanding of communication in many facets. Nick Enfield, a linguistic anthropologist, reviewed Goodwin‚Äôs final book, ‚ÄúCo-Operative Action,‚Äù and offered a shining characterization of Goodwin as ‚Äúone of the most creative, insightful, and unfettered scholars of human social action in interaction.‚Äù Overview of major works * \\"Professional Vision\\" (1994) This essay is Goodwin's most cited work. According to Goodwin, the ability to discern what is important in any profession is not a natural psychological ability, but one that emerges from the discursive practices of professionals demonstrating their expertise. He claims that the effective use of discursive practices such as coding, highlighting, and graphical representation, allows archaeologists, lawyers, and police officers to see and help others see \\"objects of knowledge\\" phenomena of interest to them in their profession.

Life  Radler was born in Posen (now Pozna≈Ñ in Poland) and grew up in the German Democratic Republic, but retained Austrian citizenship and was therefore able to travel freely to and from the West. In 1965, he was recruited by the Stasi as a \\"secret agent\\" and was assigned the alias IM \\"Thomas\\". He studied Protestant theology at the Humboldt University of Berlin and later at the University of Jena, and regularly reported on contacts he made there. In July 1968, he revealed to his Stasi superiors the names of several fellow students who had entrusted to him letters to carry to West Berlin. As a result, six students were sentenced to between 2 and 3 years in prison for \\"planned flight from the Republic\\" or \\"subversive acts\\" (one of the students wrote that he was blackmailed for \\"active anti-communist work in an illegal student organization\\"). Two of them committed suicide in prison. Through his IM activities about 23 young people were prosecuted for a total of 50 years of detention. To protect Radler's identity, the Stasi permitted him to continue his studies in Sweden, but continued to support him financially and employ him as an informer. After several years he was promoted to the position of IMB (\\"unofficial defence employee with enemy connection or for immediate processing suspected of enemy activity\\"). Radler completed his doctoral studies in theology at the University of Lund in 1977 with a thesis on the work of Friedrich Schleiermacher. From 1982 to 1985 he was a professor at √Öbo Akademi University in Finland.Article in Hufvudstadsbladet In 1988, he habilitated with an examination on the work of Erik Gustaf Geijer. In October of the same year, he was appointed professor of theology at the University of Jena with the support of the Stasi. In 1991, he took up a new position as professor of Systematic Ecumenical Theology and Ethics at the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg. In 1994, the Berlin pastor Dietmar Linke made public evidence of Radler's activity as a Stasi informant. Shortly thereafter in 1995, Radler gave up his professorship and returned to Sweden, where he became kyrkoherde (chief pastor) in Burtr√§sk. In addition, he was a member of the parish council for the Christian Democrats and associate professor at Ume√• University. In 2011, the Swedish historian Birgitta Almgren described his case in her book Inte bara spy ... Stasi infiltration i Sverige under kalla kriget (\\"Not just spies ... Stasi infiltration in Sweden during the Cold War\\") without revealing his name. Finally in the spring of 2012, the newspaper Expressen published a story identifying IM \\"Thomas\\" with Aleksander Radler. He denied culpability but resigned his parish office later that year after the Swedish Church launched an investigation into his case. On November 23, 2014, MDR Fernsehen screened the hour-long documentary Der Stasimann in Schweden (\\"The Stasi Man in Sweden\\") by Ryszard Solarz about Radler and his work for the Stasi. Radler was not available for an interview for this film.  Publications  * Religion und kirchliche Wirklichkeit.

During the Great Migration of Canada many British people as well as citizens from other European countries immigrated to Canada with new ideas of cooperative enterprises. Starting with unsuccessful attempts but inspired by examples from British cooperative movement as well as fast development of Canada as a state, cooperative movement became one of the important events in Canadian economic history.  Reasons  Industrialization led to the emergence of large centralized factory systems in urban centres. These systems disrupted the existing crafts system and many Canadian craftsmen lost their power in the market very quickly. As a consequence many craftsmen became poor or lost their jobs. This made craftsmen to start to unite in small cooperative enterprises to provide themselves power to control their business and products they couldn't afford otherwise. That's how cooperative movement began:  History  = Early attempts = In the middle of the 19th century, Canada went through big events in its history. After a series of rebellions, the British government by the Act of Union in 1840 united the Lower and Upper Canada into the United Province of Canada. After eight years Canada achieved a responsible government. British ideas of cooperatives flowed into Canada and the first attempts of establishing new marketing cooperatives occurred around the 1840s. However, most of them were unstable and failed. The first recorded consumer cooperative was organized at Stellarton, Nova Scotia, in 1864. In the same year there are records that the first cooperative bank was organized in Prince Edward Island in North Rustico. During the 1880s with the support of Knights of Labor trade union, some worker cooperatives emerged. These early attempts took place before there were any specific cooperative legislation or accepted international principles. This allowed cooperative members to create their own agile company law to follow, which was very important in the early stages of development. = Rural cooperatives = Agricultural movements were the first successful cooperative movements in Canada. The dairy industry had a lot of opportunities because many farmers had excessive production of milk. Between 1860 and 1900 not without help of Canadian Pacific Railway there were developed over 1200 cooperative creameries and cheese factories in Ontario, Qu√©bec and Atlantic Canada. With reefer ships becoming more common cheese became a major export to Great Britain. Grain Growers Grain Co circa 1910 In Prairie Canada farmers led by Edward Alexander Partridge organized the Grain Growers' Grain Company in 1906. Their aim was to market directly to millers and European buyers. Patridge had strong beliefs in cooperation as a weapon against \\"the financial buccaneers\\" that could bring \\"an industrial millenium.\\" Before World War I many other farmer cooperatives appeared in different branches of the agricultural industry, such as fruit, livestock, and tobacco. In particular, the Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Co. appeared in 1911 and the Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Co. Rural cooperatives had a huge influence in political area. Among the main movements were the Patrons of Husbandry (1870s), the Patrons of Industry (1890s), Progressive movement (1914-1930), the western branches of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and Social Credit Party of Canada (both in the 1930s) During World War I rural cooperatives expanded rapidly due to consumer demand for cheaper food. Moreover, farmers explored new ways of marketing and cooperative ways of saving and borrowing money. Cooperatives who experienced bigger growth included the new multipurpose Co-operative F√©d√©r√©e (established 1910 in Qu√©bec), and United Farmers' Co-operative (established 1914 in Ontario). Alberta Grain Company grain elevator By 1919 as farmers wanted to control the marketing of their products more, they were drawn in a system so-called \\"cooperative pooling\\". The principle of the system was to sign contracts with cooperative members to sell all their products through their cooperative. In return members would receive dividends. According to these principles farmers of Prairies organized wheat pools in the 1920s. = Consumer cooperatives = Early consumer cooperatives were created by immigrants from Europe who brought new economic ideas with them. They were British, Finnish, Italian, and Ukrainian workers, most commonly in the mining towns of Cape Breton, Northern Ontario, the Rocky Mountains and Vancouver Island. The British consumer theory of cooperation dominated. The consumer movement was supported by the Cooperative Union of Canada that was organized in 1909 and particularly by its General Secretary, George Keen. In mining communities one of the most successful stores was the British Canadian Co-operative Society in Sydney Mines. Started by recent arrivals from Britain, it strictly followed the Rochdale system. In 1908 it created an educational fund. Within 30 years the society was prospering; in 1938 it had nearly 3500 members and gross annual sales of 3 million dollars. From 1917 it was one of the largest consumer co- operatives in North America. = Financial cooperatives = In 1900 Alphonse Desjardins founded a banking cooperative or his first caisse populaire in Qu√©bec that now is known as Desjardins Group. Using connections within the Roman Catholic Church and with key political figures Alphonse created a foundation for this movement before his death in 1920. Desjardins was an official reporter of debates in the House of Commons. Pursuing ethical goals of movement, he included, as a condition of membership in his societies, the rules that obligate each member to be \\"punctual in his payments\\", \\"sober\\", \\"of good habits\\", \\"industrious\\", and \\"scrupulously honest\\". He cooperated with another leader of movement, Frederick Debartzch Monk, a Conservative Member of Parliament from Montr√©al to introduce seven bills for co-operative legislation between 1906 and 1911. The second bill from these led to the creation of a Parliamentary committee on co-operation. The third bill with the help of newly established committee passed the House of Commons but was defeated on the third reading in the Senate by a margin of one vote. These proceedings encouraged even more interest in co-operation in Canada. During the 1930s financial cooperatives in particular the credit unions gained huge support from the Antigonish movement through Jimmy Tompkins. In 1931 he made Roy Bergengren of the Credit Union National Association to present the value of co-operative credit societies. Within one year a credit union act had been passed. From 1933 with the first appearance of credit unions in Nova Scotia the wave of cooperative banking spread over Maritimes. By 1939 there were 148 credit unions in Nova Scotia, 68 in New Brunswick, and 37 in Prince Edward Island. The Nova Scotian League with many other credit union leagues emerged in the late 1930s. It later joined the Credit Union National Association in the United States, and as a response to that, the nationalist group from Acadians soon developed their own credit union central and insurance company. The movement got even more power with the appearance of insurance and trust companies in the 1940s and 1950s in Qu√©bec, Ontario and Saskatchewan. = Cooperative housing = Ideas of cooperative housing were emerging in the minds of movement leaders before World War I. Governed by high principles and inspired by a 1910 speaking tour of Henry Vivian, a cooperative leader from Britain invited by Earl Grey, George Keen and Samuel Carter advocated cooperative housing as a way to future cities: Despite such enlightenment cooperative housing couldn't start until the 1930s when mining families in Nova Scotia had serious housing problems. The Antigonish movement in attempt to develop housing coops invited Mary Arnold, one of the most important housing leaders in New York, to come to Cape Breton and promote their ideas. As a result, cooperatives of families united to build houses for themselves and over 30,000 houses would be built in Atlantic Canada. At the same time more conventional housing cooperatives appeared among students at the University of Toronto. Students at Queen's University, Waterloo University and Ottawa University also joined the movement. Today, it is rather small but successful. After World War II some citizens of the biggest cities in Canada started to independently organize housing cooperatives and sometimes also living communities. This way cooperatives continued to develop during 1960 and 1970s. = Worker cooperatives = After unsuccessful attempts of the Knights of Labour to develop worker coops in the 1880s, there were several local provincial efforts in the twentieth century. Samuel Carter who became a first president of the Co-operative Union of Canada together with George Keen were impressed by labour co-operatives and tried to create one in Guelph in 1910, where he owned a knitting mill and further was a major in 1913‚Äì1914. In spite of his huge power in the city his attempt failed. George Keen strongly propagated worker cooperatives throughout Southern Ontario, with the following message: Only during economic expansion after World War II did ideas of worker cooperatives start to be taken seriously. The largest ones appeared in Qu√©bec forestry industries and they remain this way until today. In the 1960s and 1970s worker cooperatives began to appear in Montr√©al, Toronto, Vancouver and Victoria. They helped to develop similar coops in many areas of industry including energy, bakeries, tourism, crafts, restaurants and some social services. = Fishing cooperatives = East Coast fishing cooperatives were started in the 1920s. These cooperatives found themselves in a difficult marketing situation and were not stable in maintaining an effective united front to their industry competitors. Hardly organized and despite support from Antigonish movement, in the 1970s and 1980s the cooperatives were not able to show the federal government the need to protect the fisheries they were worked in. This led to a rapid decline in fishing stocks and the destruction of these fisheries in the 1980s. West Coast fishing cooperatives began at about the same time. In contrast, with the help of fishing unions, they had a strong associational spirit. Father Jimmy Tompkins and Father Moses Coady, leaders of the Antigonish movement, put a huge effort to help fishing communities in the Maritimes, in particular, in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Between 1918 and 1933 the marketed value of fish products sold by these communities fell by 50%. By lobbying Tompkins and Coady got attention of government on the situation and soon Coady was employed by the Department of Fisheries as an organizer of fishing co-ops. Having great success due to his prior investigation of international experience and good organizational skill, Coady influenced the establishment of the United Maritimes Fisheries. Another large fishing cooperative located in Prince Rupert on the northern coast of British Columbia was the Prince Rupert Fishermen's Co-operative Association. Its leaders became important figures in the Canadian movement generally and its general manager, Ken Harding, became an international leader in the cooperative fishing world. = Health cooperatives = The need for proper health services was common in Canada, especially in lands with low population density. This caused some rural cooperatives to make arrangements with doctors for their members as early as the 1920s. In the 1960s, inspired by the Beveridge report that British government started to implement after World War II, the Canadian government introduced universal health care in Saskatchewan. This led to strikes of the province's doctors, and cooperatives health clinics started to appear in Saskatoon. Further development of cooperatives began also outside of Saskatchewan, but it was hard to organise cooperative health clinics with a health system financed by the government. In recent years, interest in health cooperatives has increased with rising of health care costs. Now, around 60% of all health coops in Canada are situated in Qu√©bec.  Examples of modern cooperatives in Canada  The three major Canadian cooperative organizations are: *CCA - Canadian Co-operative Association *DID - D√©veloppement international Desjardins *SOCODEVI - soci√©t√© de coop√©ration pour le d√©veloppement international There are also some notable aboriginal cooperatives: *Akochikan Co-operative: Pukatawagan, Manitoba *Ikaluktutiak Co-operative: Cambridge Bay, Nunavut *Neechi Foods Co-operative Limited: Winnipeg, Manitoba References Further reading * External links *To the members of the Grange Patrons of Husbandry of Canada, these essays, Flora, Ceres, and Pomona are respectfully dedicated by Mrs. Moffat, Edge Hill, Ontario *Grain elevators of Port Arthur & Fort William *Organising Fishery Co- operatives in British Columbia: A Handbook *The Co-operative Union of Canada (organised 1909) and its objects *Pictures of Ukrainian in Canada, late 19th and early 20th century Category:Cooperative movement Category:Cooperatives in Canada Category:Socialism in Canada Category:Economic history of Canada ","title":"History of cooperatives in Canada"},{"id":"57263033","text":"Epiphaxum is a genus of extinct anthozoans in the family Lithotelestidae.

The shows all share the same basic structure of a faux campaign ad for Ronald Reagan, satirizing his social policies, particularly those regarding drugs and minorities. The shows received largely mixed reviews. Background Garry Trudeau was a vocal critic of Reagan throughout his presidency, and devoted considerable space in his comic strip Doonesbury to attacking his policies, administration, and Reagan himself. In the early 1980s, Trudeau took a hiatus from the strip to write Doonesbury: A Musical Comedy, a Broadway show that brought an end to many of the strip's long running story lines in anticipation of rebooting it in a format that eliminated its floating timeline and allowed the characters to age and grow. In addition to the play's narrative, it also featured several self-contained sketches satirizing the Reagan administration; after the play closed, Trudeau and Swados decided to expand on the sketches and turn them into their own show, timing the release to the 1984 presidential election. A music video was produced in conjunction with the play, to be used as a satirical fundraising tape by the San Francisco Democratic Party. The video was shot on location in Washington D.C. and featured professional Reagan impersonator Robert H. Schmidt as well as several break dancers credited as \\"The Doonesbury Break Crew\\".Bredemeier, Kenneth. 'Rap Master Ronnie.' The Washington Post. 12 July 1984 In 1985, the play was revived in Los Angeles. Four years later, as Reagan's presidency drew to a close, Swados and Trudeau updated the show as a made for TV movie that aired on late night Cinemax in 1988 as part of the network's comedy programming block \\"Cinemax Comedy Experiment.\\" This version was titled \\"Rap Master Ronnie: A Report Card\\". Plot summary The play is presented as sixteen interlinking musical numbers, each attacking some political position of Reagan's or examining the effects Reaganomics had on the American economy and culture of the 1980s. The story is presented within a frame narrative of Ronald Reagan, Nancy Reagan, Edwin Meese, and several Secret Service agents (who serve as the chorus) taking a limo into the inner city to film a campaign ad encouraging blacks to vote for him. Despite the title, only the opening number is performed in the style of old-school hip hop, with the remainder of the songs being 1980s style pop. Casts =Off-Broadway cast= * Reathel Bean as Ronald Reagan * Catherine Cox * Ernestine Jackson as Nancy Reagan/various * Mel Johnson Jr. * Richard Ryder * \\"The Doonesbury Break Crew\\" =Music video= * Robert H. Schmidt as Ronald Reagan * \\"The Doonesbury Break Crew\\" =Film cast= * Jim Morris as Ronald Reagan * Carol Kane * Jon Cryer * The Smothers Brothers Reception The play received generally mixed to positive reviews. The New York Times praised the more overtly satirical numbers, particularly those related to Reagan's job policies and views on women's rights, but criticized Trudeau's efforts to be more serious, calling them \\"more sincere than compelling\\". The Times also criticized the play's portrayal of minorities, calling them \\"abstractions, not characters.\\" Conversely, the television movie was negatively reviewed, with the Los Angeles Times calling it \\"incessantly unfunny\\" and criticizing the show for reusing the same jokes that several other comedians had been using about Reagan for years, without enough original material or insights. In popular culture The Simpsons episode \\"Homer Loves Flanders\\" parodies the show as \\"Rappin' Ronnie Reagan,\\" a novelty song that Homer owns on cassette tape. The show is referenced again in the episode \\"Lisa on Ice\\", with Kent Brockman delivering a sensationalized news headline: \\"President Reagan dyes... his hair, says Garry Trudeau in his new musical comedy revue!\\" References Category:1984 musicals Category:Broadway musicals Category:Musicals based on comic strips Category:Ronald Reagan ","title":"Rap Master Ronnie"},{"id":"57263134","text":"Victoria Park, Edinburgh in spring.

Early life and education Stewart was born on 9 February 1919 in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland. He graduated from the University of Glasgow in 1939 with a BSc degree. He later received an MB, ChB, and MD from the University of Glasgow in 1942, 1942, and 1949, respectively; he also received a diploma in tropical medicine and hygiene from the University of Liverpool in 1948. Career Stewart served as a surgeon-lieutenant in the Royal Navy from 1943 to 1946. He then held several hospital appointments, including senior registrar and tutor at the Wright-Fleming Institute at St Mary's Hospital, London from 1948 to 1952, where he worked alongside Alexander Fleming. He became professor of pathology and bacteriology at the University of Karachi in 1952. He served as a consultant pathologist to the South West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board of the National Health Service, as well as head of laboratories at the Medical Research Council Laboratories at Carshalton, from 1954 to 1963. He then traveled to the United States, where he served as Professor of Epidemiology and Pathology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill until 1968, and as Watkins Professor of Epidemiology at Tulane University Medical Center until 1972. From 1972 to 1984, he was the Henry Mechan Professor of Public Health at the University of Glasgow. Roles in government investigations In 1974, Stewart was part of a government- appointed team tasked with investigating experimental, now-banned whooping cough vaccines given by the British government to orphans and mentally handicapped children. In 1984, he was commissioned to write a report on the whooping cough vaccine by Britain's chief scientific officer, but the report was never made public by the then-British Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke. Views on vaccines In the 1970s, Stewart became well-known for his opposition to the pertussis vaccine, which he claimed to have supported until 1974, when he saw many vaccinated children who had still developed pertussis. By the mid-1970s, his criticisms of vaccines had attracted the attention of many parents who felt that their children had been injured by vaccines. With his support, the Association of Parents of Vaccine Damaged Children was formed in 1973. In 1977, he published a paper citing the cases of many of these children as proof that the DPT vaccine caused brain damage. In 1978, he claimed at a news conference that \\"As with many other infectious diseases, there was a great decline in the rate of pertussis mortality before any vaccine was available.\\" He also claimed that it was safer to get pertussis than to receive the vaccine. In 1977, Stewart criticized the British government's Committee on Safety of Medicines for calling for a pertussis vaccination campaign. He argued that \\"There are no grounds for saying a major epidemic is on the way and I don't agree with the way their figures have been collected.\\" In the next two years, however, over 100,000 children were hospitalized with pertussis, and 600 of them died. In the mid-1980s, Stewart served as the lead witness for the prosecution in the case of Johnnie Kinnear, whose mental development was allegedly stunted due to his receipt of the pertussis vaccine. The case unraveled after contradictions were revealed between Kinnear's parents' testimony and hospital records, and Stewart's role in the pertussis vaccine controversy came to an end as a result. =Public health consequences= Stewart's public criticisms of vaccines contributed to a dramatic decrease in vaccination rates in the United Kingdom, and a resulting increase in cases of pertussis there. He later made an appearance in the 1982 WRC-TV news report \\"Vaccine Roulette\\", where his work was portrayed favorably. The host of the report, Lea Thompson, introduced Stewart as a member of the Committee on Safety of Medicines, despite the fact that he had never been a member of this group. Thompson also did not mention any of Stewart's previous associations with parents who believed their children had been injured by vaccines, nor did she note that his research had been used by some such parents as evidence in lawsuits. Views on HIV/AIDS A former World Health Organization advisor on AIDS, Stewart was described as one of two HIV/AIDS \\"dissidents to a degree\\" by the Guardian in 2000 (the other being Andrew Herxheimer). Stewart and Herxheimer both served on Thabo Mbeki's presidential advisory panel on AIDS. In a 1990 Dispatches episode about HIV/AIDS, Stewart claimed that HIV had not spread significantly among heterosexuals in either the United States or Great Britain, dismissing the disease's spread in Africa as \\"something else\\". Epidemiologist Roy M. Anderson dismissed this claim, arguing that Stewart \\"would benefit from becoming aware of the scientific literature\\". In 1995, he argued against giving azidothymidine to pregnant women who had AIDS, even though it had already been shown to be effective at preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. In 1997, he co-authored an article in Current Medical Research and Opinion along with several HIV/AIDS denialists, including Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos of the Perth Group. In 2000, he told the Guardian: \\"We have been criminally irresponsible - we have told people they have Aids when they are HIV positive and that's not true. We have told them there is no cure and no vaccine and they are going to die. We have caused endless stress and even suicide. Families have worried about whether their children are going to be infected. That's why it is such a panic disease. The medical establishment has made the panic.\\" With respect to his views on the cause of AIDS, he was an outspoken supporter of Peter Duesberg's belief that it was not HIV, and argued that there was a conspiracy aimed at preventing such views from attracting public attention.

Lee is known for quick and accurate decision-making, and exceptional ball handling skills. Early life Lee started playing competitive football at the age of eleven, when he entered Jung Hwa Elementary School. Showing great athleticism at a very young age, he was scouted and was asked to move to Jang An Middle School where he continued training. His efforts did not go unnoticed as he was selected to be a part of the Under-15 National Youth Team of South Korea. As a testament to his remarkable performance as a young footballer, he once again had to move to Pung Sang High School to join a group of young men who would form the K1 League Seongnam Ilhwa FC's Youth Team. He went on to play for the said team and would eventually be one of only three players from his batch to secure a contract with Seongnam FC. Club career =Seongnam FC= Lee secured a three-year contract with Seongnam FC when he was still in high school. Despite having already been selected to be a part of the K1 League Team's roster, Lee went on to pursue schooling at the Chung Ang University in Seoul.

Lee was recruited to FC Meralco Manila as one of only four non-Filipino players in a roster of 26 athletes. As regulation provided for only four foreigners in a team, the selection process was rigorous, but Lee was easily chosen because he stood out in the pool of trainees. Upon selection to the team, he joined the team bannered by esteemed Filipino Coach Ariston Caslib and consisting of celebrated national team players from the Philippines. FC Meralco Manila went on the league series as the number one team after the eliminations round. Lee was instrumental to the success of the team, only missing 3 games at the start of the season due to recovery from ankle impingement during a pre-season practice game, and 1 match for a game suspension resulting from accumulated yellow cards. Lee was awarded Man of the Match in a couple of games because of his outstanding performances. Despite entering the Finals Series as the top seed Club, FC Meralco Manila lost to Global Cebu FC in the Semi-Finals, and eventually settled for the second runners up position. =Global Cebu FC= As the new season of the Philippines Football League was just about to commence, news broke out about the cessation of FC Meralco Manila‚Äôs operations.

She was a member of the \\"Worpswede artists' colony\\".  Biography  One of six siblings, Agnes Plump grew up in Bremen where, it was said, the Plumps had lived for ten generations. The family were well connected. Later she became godmother to Karl Carstens, a leading national politician during the 1960s‚Äì80s. Hermann Plump, her father, was a grain merchant who had wanted to be a painter himself. Agnes Plump's talent for drawing was picked out during her first school years. She received her first art lessons from the Bremen artist Margarethe von Reinken. During 1907 and 1908 she attended the Bremen Arts Academy where she was enrolled in portraiture classes with Walter Magnussen (1869‚Äì1946). In 1909 Agnes Plump married the tobacco merchant F.Sander. The marriage did not last long, but by the time it was over the couple had produced three children which stimulated their mother to concentrate more on portraiture. Later the two daughters, Ursula Sander-Lohmann (1911‚Äì1978) and Hanna Sander-Lutz (born 1913), both followed their mother's career choice and became painters. Around 1910 Agnes Sander-Plump got to know Max Beckmann, Hans Meid and Wilhelm Gerstel in Berlin, which encouraged her to pursue her artistic inclinations. However, war intervened in 1914. In 1919 she returned to Berlin in order to study with Lovis Corinth. Then in 1924 she undertook a lengthy trip to Paris with Minne Beckmann, Max Beckmann's (first) wife, whose marriage was coming to an end. In 1926 she relocated to the \\"artists' colony\\" at Worpswede, where for the next few years she concentrated on portraits of children. In 1936 she painted a life-sized portrait of herself, standing before an easel. In this striking work, which can almost be described as \\"abstract\\", the face is only faintly discernible, implied through a contrast between light and dark. It was a courageous approach which stood in stark contrast to the prevailing artistic approach called for by the Nazi precepts of the time.  Work  A large number of portraits of children form the core of her surviving legacy. They are a testimony to her artistic skills, and express an unusual depth of contact between artist and subject. Her pictures of people cover an age range from infants through to young people and adults. One of her portraits is of Lisel Oppel. There are also still lifes featuring dolls and a few landscapes. Her realistic reproductions feature a high level of technical skill, well defined outlines, well-conceived depiction of surfaces and insightful use of colour.  Books  Agnes Sander-Plump published two children's books: * 1949 \\"Geheimnis der Kinder\\" (\\"Children's secret\\") * 1980 \\"Doris, Kinderjahre in einer Hansestadt 1893-1900\\" (\\"Doris: childhood years in ... [Bremen] ... 1893-1900\\") The second of these included around 40 drawings which she had produced during the 1960s, illustrating memories of a carefree childhood.

He was a writer, a monologist, and a master of ceremonies. Haskell worked as the secretary of the Jewish Theatrical Guild of America and in that capacity eulogized his friend Harry Houdini. Career Haskell was born as Lorne Levy in Newark, New Jersey in 1870 and he took up a mercantile career. By 1898 he had chosen to retire from that business and he gained employ with burlesque producers Hurtig and Seaman as a librettist and performer. Haskell had an interest in entertainment having recorded the short silent film Facial Expressions by Loney Haskell in 1897 in which he demonstrated a variety of emotions with the camera close in to his face. The Fourteenth Street Theatre featured a production of In New York Town between October 30 and November 4, 1905. The comedy musical was based on the work of Haskell and Willard Holcomb with music by Albert Von Tilzer. Haskell initially gained popularity in vaudeville as a monologist. He then made a name for himself as a lecturer for dime museum-style acts promoted by Willie Hammerstein, introducing and discussing Hammerstein's curiosities such as \\"The Half Woman\\". He had the ability to entertain the audience even if the act themselves were unable to communicate well. Haskell provided running commentary for numerous \\"freak\\" acts. In 1912 Haskell acted as the interpreter for Don the Talking Dog, fielding questions for the canine and helping to present his responses. Don featured on the same bill as famed escapologist Harry Houdini. Variety reported that Haskell does not get mentioned in the program but that he should divide the billing with the dog given that he utilized nine of the twelve minutes. According to celebrity columnist O. O. McIntyre, Haskell became so fond of the dog that \\"in one-night stands he slept in the dog's kennel\\". Haskell was a friend of Oscar Hammerstein and worked as the assistant manager of the Victoria Theatre alongside Hammerstein's son, Willie. On Willie's death Haskell continued to operate the theatre now alongside Arthur Hammerstein. Houdini was also a friend of Haskell's and Haskell, in his capacity as secretary of the Jewish Theatrical Guild of America, would go on to eulogize Houdini in 1926. Death Haskell died in the offices of the Jewish Theatrical Guild on October 20, 1933.

It forms a part of the larger Pan-Borneo Highway network which also combines with highway networks of East Malaysia and Brunei. The combined highway network forms the entire Asian Highway Network Route AH150. The Trans-Kalimantan Highway Southern Route is linked to the Sarawak Pan-Borneo Highway FT1 via the Trans-Malindo Highway that links to the border crossing towns of Entikong and Tebedu. A new border crossing in Aruk at the western terminus of the Trans-Kalimantan Highway Southern Route was inaugurated by the President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo on 17 March 2017, which is linked to the Sarawak Pan-Borneo Highway FT1 via the Lundu‚ÄìBiawak Road (Sarawak State Route Q516). Route background The Trans-Kalimantan Highway Southern Route is one of the three backbone highways in Kalimantan being planned by the Indonesian government; the other two are the Trans-Kalimantan Highway Central Route (Jalan Lintas Kalimantan Poros Tengah) and the Trans- Kalimantan Highway Northern Route (Jalan Lintas Kalimantan Poros Utara). None of the three highways bear any route number yet. The total length of the Trans-Kalimantan Highway Southern Route is . The Trans-Kalimantan Highway Southern Route is a semi-circular highway that runs along the coastlines of Kalimantan. The highway begins from Aruk, a small border town in Sambas Regency, West Kalimantan, where the highway continues in Sarawak as the Lundu‚ÄìBiawak Road Q516.West Kalimantan Province Road Map - by the Road Preservation Directorate, Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing, Indonesia. It passes through most major cities and towns in Kalimantan. Most major bridges in Kalimantan such as the Kapuas Bridge, Tayan Bridge and Mahakam Bridge are located along this highway. There is a missing link between Penajam and Balikpapan separated by Balikpapan Bay, requiring motorists to cross the bay by ferry or use a longer provincial highway that bypasses the bay.East Kalimantan Province Road Map - by the Road Preservation Directorate, Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing, Indonesia. The missing link is planned to be eliminated through the construction of the Balang Island Bridge, which is targeted to be completed in 2019. From Balikpapan to Samarinda, the highway runs in parallel with the first controlled-access expressway in Borneo, the Samarinda-Balikpapan Expressway, which is also under construction. The Trans-Kalimantan Highway Southern Route ends at Malinau City in North Kalimantan, where the highway is linked to the Trans-Kalimantan Highway Northern Route to Simanggaris.North Kalimantan Province Road Map - by the Road Preservation Directorate, Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing, Indonesia. The entire Trans-Kalimantan Highway Southern Route, together with the Trans-Malindo Highway and the section of the Trans-Kalimantan Highway Northern Route from Malinau City to Simanggaris, forms the Indonesian section of the Asian Highway Network route AH150. History During colonial times in 1800s, the European colonists were obsessed in travelling across the Borneo island from east to west by land. In 1825, a troop of Dutch army led by Major George Muller began their expedition by going upstream along the Mahakam River from Samarinda to the river source before proceeding inland by foot. However, Muller and his troops mysteriously disappeared without any traces. Later, a Dutch doctor named Anton W. Niewenhuis became the first Dutch explorer who had successfully travelled across Borneo from Samarinda in the east to Pontianak in the west by land. However, the Kalimantan region still lacked a proper highway network until 1970s where logging companies began constructing logging roads before those roads were converted into national roads by the Indonesian government. However, the construction to link the former logging roads to form the Trans-Kalimantan Highway was very sluggish. On 6 June 1989, the governors of the four Kalimantan provinces (West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, South Kalimantan and East Kalimantan) urged the central government to speed up the construction pace, and the Ministry of Public Works and People's Housing promised to them that the highway would be completed in 2009. The Trans Kalimantan Highway Southern Route was completed in 2016 with the opening of the Tayan Bridge. The Trans-Kalimantan Highway Southern Route is notorious for its poor condition in many sections. , of the highway was built below the Asian Highway Network Class III standards (lane width: 3.0 m; design speed limit: 80 km/h). Many sections of the highway is still unpaved yet, including the first from its western terminus at the new border crossing in Aruk.

McKeown (1965‚Äì2017) was a historian of transnational migration.  Biography  Born in San Francisco, McKeown earned his PhD in history at the University of Chicago in 1997. His dissertation, later published as Chinese Migrant Networks and Cultural Change, studied Chinese migrants in Chicago, Peru, and Hawaii, and highlighted the transnational networks developed by migrant flow. In his important 2004 article \\"Global Migration, 1846‚Äì1940,\\" McKeown showed Asian migration was comparable to its contemporary transatlantic migration.

In 2016, a group of teenaged women \\"took over\\" the village and enacted several civic improvements within two years. The village is located among rice paddies, banana trees and sugar cane fields. There is a high level of alcoholism among men in this village, and it's been reported that most of the 150 men in the village engage in heavy drinking every day. The village has an extremely high percentage of widows and also high rates of human trafficking.  Young girls' club  After a women's empowerment club called the \\"young girls' club\\" opened in Thennamadevi, approximately two dozen teenaged women decided to enact major changes in their village. Between 2016 and 2018, the group focused on making it safer for young people in the village to attend school. They installed street lights in the village's two unpaved streets, added a 150-book library and got local authorities to add a bus stop that goes into town. They convinced health officials to provide modern feminine sanitary products in the nearest clinic. They also started a campaign to install toilets in individual homes, to both prevent men from harassing women in the town's public toilet, and to address the health challenges associated with large public communal bathrooms. Club members have pledged to help girls who are married against their will before they are 18 (which is illegal in India, but not well enforced), and in meetings they teach each other about self-discipline, personal hygiene and menstrual issues. Kousalya Radakrishnan is the Thennamadevi girls club president and spokesperson, replacing the original president Says Sowmya.

Einstein's thought experiments took diverse forms. In his youth, he mentally chased beams of light. For special relativity, he employed moving trains and flashes of lightning to explain his most penetrating insights. For general relativity, he considered a person falling off a roof, accelerating elevators, blind beetles crawling on curved surfaces and the like. In his debates with Niels Bohr on the nature of reality, he proposed imaginary devices intended to show, at least in concept, how the Heisenberg uncertainty principle might be evaded. In a profound contribution to the literature on quantum mechanics, Einstein considered two particles briefly interacting and then flying apart so that their states are correlated, anticipating the phenomenon known as quantum entanglement. Introduction A thought experiment is a logical argument or mental model cast within the context of an imaginary (hypothetical or even counterfactual) scenario. A scientific thought experiment, in particular, may examine the implications of a theory, law, or set of principles with the aid of fictive and/or natural particulars (demons sorting molecules, cats whose lives hinge upon a radioactive disintegration, men in enclosed elevators) in an idealized environment (massless trapdoors, absence of friction). They describe experiments that, except for some specific and necessary idealizations, could conceivably be performed in the real world. As opposed to physical experiments, thought experiments do not report new empirical data. They can only provide conclusions based on deductive or inductive reasoning from their starting assumptions. Thought experiments invoke particulars that are irrelevant to the generality of their conclusions. It is the invocation of these particulars that give thought experiments their experiment-like appearance. A thought experiment can always be reconstructed as a straightforward argument, without the irrelevant particulars. John D. Norton, a well-known philosopher of science, has noted that \\"a good thought experiment is a good argument; a bad thought experiment is a bad argument.\\" When effectively used, the irrelevant particulars that convert a straightforward argument into a thought experiment can act as \\"intuition pumps\\" that stimulate readers' ability to apply their intuitions to their understanding of a scenario. Thought experiments have a long history. Perhaps the best known in the history of modern science is Galileo's demonstration that falling objects must fall at the same rate regardless of their masses. This has sometimes been taken to be an actual physical demonstration, involving his climbing up the Leaning Tower of Pisa and dropping two heavy weights off it. In fact, it was a logical demonstration described by Galileo in Discorsi e dimostrazioni matematiche (1638). Einstein had a highly visual understanding of physics. His work in the patent office \\"stimulated [him] to see the physical ramifications of theoretical concepts.\\" These aspects of his thinking style inspired him to fill his papers with vivid practical detail making them quite different from, say, the papers of Lorentz or Maxwell. This included his use of thought experiments. Special relativity =Pursuing a beam of light= Late in life, Einstein recalled Einstein's thought experiment as a 16-year-old student Einstein's recollections of his youthful musings are widely cited because of the hints they provide of his later great discovery. However, Norton has noted that Einstein's reminiscences were probably colored by a half-century of hindsight. Norton lists several problems with Einstein's recounting, both historical and scientific: :1. At 16 years old and a student at the Gymnasium in Aarau, Einstein would have had the thought experiment in late 1895 to early 1896. But various sources note that Einstein did not learn Maxwell's theory until 1898, in university. :2. The second issue is that a 19th century aether theorist would have had no difficulties with the thought experiment. Einstein's statement, \\"...there seems to be no such thing...on the basis of experience,\\" would not have counted as an objection, but would have represented a mere statement of fact, since no one had ever traveled at such speeds. :3. An aether theorist would have regarded \\"...nor according to Maxwell's equations\\" as simply representing a misunderstanding on Einstein's part. Unfettered by any notion that the speed of light represents a cosmic limit, the aether theorist would simply have set velocity equal to c, noted that yes indeed, the light would appear to be frozen, and then thought no more of it. Rather than the thought experiment being at all incompatible with aether theories (which it is not), the youthful Einstein appears to have reacted to the scenario out of an intuitive sense of wrongness. He felt that the laws of optics should obey the principle of relativity. As he grew older, his early thought experiment acquired deeper levels of significance: Einstein felt that Maxwell's equations should be the same for all observers in inertial motion. From Maxwell's equations, one can deduce a single speed of light, and there is nothing in this computation that depends on an observer's speed. Einstein sensed a conflict between Newtonian mechanics and the constant speed of light determined by Maxwell's equations. Regardless of the historical and scientific issues described above, Einstein's early thought experiment was part of the repertoire of test cases that he used to check on the viability of physical theories. Norton suggests that the real importance of the thought experiment was that it provided a powerful objection to emission theories of light, which Einstein had worked on for several years prior to 1905. =Magnet and conductor= In the very first paragraph of Einstein's seminal 1905 work introducing special relativity, he writes: Magnet and conductor thought experiment This opening paragraph recounts well-known experimental results obtained by Michael Faraday in 1831. The experiments describe what appeared to be two different phenomena: the motional EMF generated when a wire moves through a magnetic field (see Lorentz force), and the transformer EMF generated by a changing magnetic field (due to the Maxwell‚ÄìFaraday equation). James Clerk Maxwell himself drew attention to this fact in his 1861 paper On Physical Lines of Force. In the latter half of Part II of that paper, Maxwell gave a separate physical explanation for each of the two phenomena. Although Einstein calls the asymmetry \\"well-known\\", there is no evidence that any of Einstein's contemporaries considered the distinction between motional EMF and transformer EMF to be in any way odd or pointing to a lack of understanding of the underlying physics. Maxwell, for instance, had repeatedly discussed Faraday's laws of induction, stressing that the magnitude and direction of the induced current was a function only of the relative motion of the magnet and the conductor, without being bothered by the clear distinction between conductor-in-motion and magnet-in-motion in the underlying theoretical treatment. Yet Einstein's reflection on this experiment represented the decisive moment in his long and tortuous path to special relativity. Although the equations describing the two scenarios are entirely different, there is no measurement that can distinguish whether the magnet is moving, the conductor is moving, or both. In a 1920 review on the Fundamental Ideas and Methods of the Theory of Relativity (unpublished), Einstein related how disturbing he found this asymmetry: Einstein needed to extend the relativity of motion that he perceived between magnet and conductor in the above thought experiment to a full theory. For years, however, he did not know how this might be done. The exact path that Einstein took to resolve this issue is unknown. We do know, however, that Einstein spent several years pursuing an emission theory of light, encountering difficulties that eventually led him to give up the attempt. That decision ultimately led to his development of special relativity as a theory founded on two postulates of which he could be sure. Expressed in contemporary physics vocabulary, his postulates were as follows: :1. The laws of physics take the same form in all inertial frames. :2. In any given inertial frame, the velocity of light c is the same whether the light be emitted by a body at rest or by a body in uniform motion. [Emphasis added by editor] Einstein's wording of the second postulate was one with which nearly all theorists of his day could agree. His wording is a far more intuitive form of the second postulate than the stronger version frequently encountered in popular writings and college textbooks. =Trains, embankments, and lightning flashes= The topic of how Einstein arrived at special relativity has been a fascinating one to many scholars: A lowly, twenty-six year old patent officer (third class), largely self-taught in physics and completely divorced from mainstream research, nevertheless in the year 1905 produced four extraordinary works (Annus Mirabilis papers), only one of which (his paper on Brownian motion) appeared related to anything that he had ever published before. Einstein's paper, On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies, is a polished work that bears few traces of its gestation. Documentary evidence concerning the development of the ideas that went into it consist of, quite literally, only two sentences in a handful of preserved early letters, and various later historical remarks by Einstein himself, some of them known only second-hand and at times contradictory. Train and embankment thought experiment In regards to the relativity of simultaneity, Einstein's 1905 paper develops the concept vividly by carefully considering the basics of how time may be disseminated through the exchange of signals between clocks. In his popular work, Relativity: The Special and General Theory, Einstein translates the formal presentation of his paper into a thought experiment using a train, a railway embankment, and lightning flashes. The essence of the thought experiment is as follows: *Observer M stands on an embankment, while observer M rides on a rapidly traveling train. At the precise moment that M and M coincide in their positions, lightning strikes points A and B equidistant from M and M. *Light from these two flashes reach M at the same time, from which M concludes that the bolts were synchronous. *The combination of Einstein's first and second postulates implies that, despite the rapid motion of the train relative to the embankment, M measures exactly the same speed of light as does M. Since M was equidistant from A and B when lightning struck, the fact that M receives light from B before light from A means that to M, the bolts were not synchronous. Instead, the bolt at B struck first. A routine supposition among historians of science is that, in accordance with the analysis given in his 1905 special relativity paper and in his popular writings, Einstein discovered the relativity of simultaneity by thinking about how clocks could be synchronized by light signals. The Einstein synchronization convention was originally developed by telegraphers in the middle 19th century. The dissemination of precise time was an increasingly important topic during this period. Trains needed accurate time to schedule use of track, cartographers needed accurate time to determine longitude, while astronomers and surveyors dared to consider the worldwide dissemination of time to accuracies of thousandths of a second. Following this line of argument, Einstein's position in the patent office, where he specialized in evaluating electromagnetic and electromechanical patents, would have exposed him to the latest developments in time technology, which would have guided him in his thoughts towards understanding the relativity of simultaneity. However, all of the above is supposition. In later recollections, when Einstein was asked about what inspired him to develop special relativity, he would mention his riding a light beam and his magnet and conductor thought experiments. He would also mention the importance of the Fizeau experiment and the observation of stellar aberration. \\"They were enough\\", he said. He never mentioned thought experiments about clocks and their synchronization. The routine analyses of the Fizeau experiment and of stellar aberration, that treat light as Newtonian corpuscles, do not require relativity. But problems arise if one considers light as waves traveling through an aether, which are resolved by applying the relativity of simultaneity. It is entirely possible, therefore, that Einstein arrived at special relativity through a different path than that commonly assumed, through Einstein's examination of Fizeau's experiment and stellar aberration. We therefore do not know just how important clock synchronization and the train and embankment thought experiment were to Einstein's development of the concept of the relativity of simultaneity. We do know, however, that the train and embankment thought experiment was the preferred means whereby he chose to teach this concept to the general public. =Impossibility of faster-than- light signaling= Einstein's 1907 thought experiment demonstrating that FTL signaling allows violation of causality. In 1907, Einstein noted that from the composition law for velocities, one could deduce that there cannot exist an effect that allows faster-than-light signaling. Einstein imagined a strip of material that allows propagation of signals at the faster-than-light speed of W (as viewed from the material strip). Imagine two observers, A and B, standing on the x-axis and separated by the distance L. They stand next to the material strip, which is not at rest, but rather is moving in the negative x-direction with speed v. A uses the strip to send a signal to B. From the velocity composition formula, the signal propagates from A to B with speed {(W-v) /(1 -(Wv/c^2))} . The time T required for the signal to propagate from A to B is given by : T = L { 1 - (Wv/c^2) \\\\over W-v } . The strip can move at any speed v < c. Given the starting assumption W > c, one can always set the strip moving at a speed v such that T < 0. In other words, given the existence of a means of transmitting signals faster-than-light, scenarios can be envisioned whereby the recipient of a signal will receive the signal before the transmitter has transmitted it. About this thought experiment, Einstein wrote: General relativity =Falling painters and accelerating elevators= In his unpublished 1920 review, Einstein related the genesis of his thoughts on the equivalence principle: The realization \\"startled\\" Einstein, and inspired him to begin an eight-year quest that led to what is considered to be his greatest work, the theory of general relativity. Over the years, the story of the falling man has become an iconic one, much embellished by other writers. In most retellings of Einstein's story, the falling man is identified as a painter. In some accounts, Einstein was inspired after he witnessed a painter falling from the roof of a building adjacent to the patent office where he worked. This version of the story leaves unanswered the question of why Einstein might consider his observation of such an unfortunate accident to represent the happiest thought in his life. A thought experiment used by Einstein to illustrate the equivalence principle Einstein later refined his thought experiment to consider a man inside a large enclosed chest or elevator falling freely in space. While in free fall, the man would consider himself weightless, and any loose objects that he emptied from his pockets would float alongside him. Then Einstein imagined a rope attached to the roof of the chamber. A powerful \\"being\\" of some sort begins pulling on the rope with constant force. The chamber begins to move \\"upwards\\" with a uniformly accelerated motion. Within the chamber, all of the man's perceptions are consistent with his being in a uniform gravitational field. Einstein asked, \\"Ought we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion?\\" Einstein answered no. Rather, the thought experiment provided \\"good grounds for extending the principle of relativity to include bodies of reference which are accelerated with respect to each other, and as a result we have gained a powerful argument for a generalised postulate of relativity.\\" Through this thought experiment, Einstein addressed an issue that was so well known, scientists rarely worried about it or considered it puzzling: Objects have \\"gravitational mass,\\" which determines the force with which they are attracted to other objects. Objects also have \\"inertial mass,\\" which determines the relationship between the force applied to an object and how much it accelerates. Newton had pointed out that, even though they are defined differently, gravitational mass and inertial mass always seem to be equal. But until Einstein, no one had conceived a good explanation as to why this should be so. From the correspondence revealed by his thought experiment, Einstein concluded that \\"it is impossible to discover by experiment whether a given system of coordinates is accelerated, or whether...the observed effects are due to a gravitational field.\\" This correspondence between gravitational mass and inertial mass is the equivalence principle. An extension to his accelerating observer thought experiment allowed Einstein to deduce that \\"rays of light are propagated curvilinearly in gravitational fields.\\" =Non- Euclidean geometry and the rotating disk= Einstein's formulation of special relativity was in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies without reference to forces). Late in 1907, his former mathematics professor, Hermann Minkowski, presented an alternative, geometric interpretation of special relativity in a lecture to the G√∂ttingen Mathematical society, introducing the concept of spacetime. Einstein was initially dismissive of Minkowski's geometric interpretation, regarding it as √ºberfl√ºssige Gelehrsamkeit (superfluous learnedness). Consideration of the Ehrenfest paradox led Einstein to consider that gravitation curves spacetime. As with special relativity, Einstein's early results in developing what was ultimately to become general relativity were accomplished using kinematic analysis rather than geometric techniques of analysis. Starting with the equivalence principle, Einstein deduced the phenomena of gravitational time dilation, the gravitational bending of light (albeit with the wrong value), and the gravitational slowing of the speed of light. By 1912, however, Einstein had reached an impasse, realizing that he needed to go beyond the mathematics that he knew and was familiar with. Stachel has identified Einstein's analysis of the rigid relativistic rotating disk as being key to this realization. The rigid rotating disk had been a topic of lively discussion since Max Born and Paul Ehrenfest, in 1909, both presented analyses of rigid bodies in special relativity. An observer on the edge of a rotating disk experiences an apparent (\\"fictitious\\" or \\"pseudo\\") force called \\"centrifugal force\\". By 1912, Einstein had become convinced of a close relationship between gravitation and pseudo- forces such as centrifugal force: In the accompanying illustration, A represents a circular disk of 10 units diameter at rest in an inertial reference frame. The circumference of the disk is \\\\pi times the diameter, and the illustration shows 31.4 rulers laid out along the circumference. B represents a circular disk of 10 units diameter that is spinning rapidly. According to a non-rotating observer, each of the rulers along the circumference is length contracted along its line of motion. More rulers are required to cover the circumference, while the number of rulers required to span the diameter is unchanged. In later years, Einstein repeatedly stated that consideration of the rapidly rotating disk was of \\"decisive importance\\" to him because it showed that a gravitational field causes non-Euclidean arrangements of measuring rods. Einstein realized that he did not have the mathematical skills to describe the non-Euclidean view of space and time that he envisioned, so he turned to his mathematician friend, Marcel Grossmann, for help. After researching in the library, Grossman found a review article by Ricci and Levi-Civita on absolute differential calculus (tensor calculus). Grossman tutored Einstein on the subject, and in 1913 and 1914, they published two joint papers describing an initial version of a generalized theory of gravitation. Over the next several years, Einstein used these mathematical tools to generalize Minkowski's geometric approach to relativity so as to encompass curved spacetime. Quantum mechanics =Background: Einstein and the quantum= Many myths have grown up about Einstein's relationship with quantum mechanics. Freshman physics students are aware that Einstein explained the photoelectric effect and introduced the concept of the photon. But students who have grown up with the photon may not be aware of how revolutionary the concept was for his time. The best-known factoids about Einstein's relationship with quantum mechanics are his statement, \\"God does not play dice with the universe\\" and the indisputable fact that he just did not like the theory in its final form. This has led to the general impression that, despite his initial contributions, Einstein was out of touch with quantum research and played at best a secondary role in its development. Concerning Einstein's estrangement from the general direction of physics research after 1925, his well-known scientific biographer, Abraham Pais, wrote: In hindsight, we know that Pais was incorrect in his assessment. Einstein was arguably the greatest single contributor to the \\"old\\" quantum theory. * In his 1905 paper on light quanta, Einstein created the quantum theory of light. His proposal that light exists as tiny packets (photons) was so revolutionary, that even such major pioneers of quantum theory as Planck and Bohr refused to believe that it could be true. Bohr, in particular, was a passionate disbeliever in light quanta, and repeatedly argued against them until 1925, when he yielded in the face of overwhelming evidence for their existence. * In his 1906 theory of specific heats, Einstein was the first to realize that quantized energy levels explained the specific heat of solids. In this manner, he found a rational justification for the third law of thermodynamics (i.e. the entropy of any system approaches zero as the temperature approaches absolute zero): at very cold temperatures, atoms in a solid do not have enough thermal energy to reach even the first excited quantum level, and so cannot vibrate. * Einstein proposed the wave-particle duality of light. In 1909, using a rigorous fluctuation argument based on a thought experiment and drawing on his previous work on Brownian motion, he predicted the emergence of a \\"fusion theory\\" that would combine the two views. Basically, he demonstrated that the Brownian motion experienced by a mirror in thermal equilibrium with black body radiation would be the sum of two terms, one due to the wave properties of radiation, the other due to its particulate properties. * Although Planck is justly hailed as the father of quantum mechanics, his derivation of the law of black-body radiation rested on fragile ground, since it required ad hoc assumptions of an unreasonable character. Furthermore, Planck's derivation represented an analysis of classical harmonic oscillators merged with quantum assumptions in an improvised fashion. In his 1916 theory of radiation, Einstein was the first to create a purely quantum explanation. This paper, well known for broaching the possibility of stimulated emission (the basis of the laser), changed the nature of the evolving quantum theory by introducing the fundamental role of random chance. * In 1924, Einstein received a short manuscript by an unknown Indian professor, Satyendra Nath Bose, outlining a new method of deriving the law of blackbody radiation. Einstein was intrigued by Bose's peculiar method of counting the number of distinct ways of putting photons into the available states, a method of counting that Bose apparently did not realize was unusual. Einstein, however, understood that Bose's counting method implied that photons are, in a deep sense, indistinguishable. He translated the paper into German and had it published. Einstein then followed Bose's paper with an extension to Bose's work which predicted Bose-Einstein condensation, one of the fundamental research topics of condensed matter physics. * While trying to develop a mathematical theory of light which would fully encompass its wavelike and particle-like aspects, Einstein developed the concept of \\"ghost fields\\". A guiding wave obeying Maxwell's classical laws would propagate following the normal laws of optics, but would not transmit any energy. This guiding wave, however, would govern the appearance of quanta of energy h u on a statistical basis, so that the appearance of these quanta would be proportional to the intensity of the interference radiation. These ideas became widely known in the physics community, and through Born's work in 1926, later became a key concept in the modern quantum theory of radiation and matter. Therefore, Einstein before 1925 originated most of the key concepts of quantum theory: light quanta, wave-particle duality, the fundamental randomness of physical processes, the concept of indistinguishability, and the probability density interpretation of the wave equation. In addition, Einstein can arguably be considered the father of solid state physics and condensed matter physics. He provided a correct derivation of the blackbody radiation law and sparked the notion of the laser. What of after 1925? In 1935, working with two younger colleagues, Einstein issued a final challenge to quantum mechanics, attempting to show that it could not represent a final solution. Despite the questions raised by this paper, it made little or no difference to how physicists employed quantum mechanics in their work. Of this paper, Pais was to write: In contrast to Pais' negative assessment, this paper, outlining the EPR paradox, has become one of the most widely cited articles in the entire physics literature. It is considered the centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory, which has been termed the \\"third quantum revolution.\\" =Wave-particle duality= All of Einstein's major contributions to the old quantum theory were arrived at via statistical argument. This includes his 1905 paper arguing that light has particle properties, his 1906 work on specific heats, his 1909 introduction of the concept of wave-particle duality, his 1916 work presenting an improved derivation of the blackbody radiation formula, and his 1924 work that introduced the concept of indistinguishability. Mirror in a cavity containing particles of an ideal gas and filled with fluctuating black body radiation. Einstein's 1909 arguments for the wave-particle duality of light were based on a thought experiment. Einstein imagined a mirror in a cavity containing particles of an ideal gas and filled with black body radiation, with the entire system in thermal equilibrium. The mirror is constrained in its motions to a direction perpendicular to its surface. The mirror jiggles from Brownian motion due to collisions with the gas molecules. Since the mirror is in a radiation field, the moving mirror transfers some of its kinetic energy to the radiation field as a result of the difference in the radiation pressure between its forwards and reverse surfaces. This implies that there must be fluctuations in the black body radiation field, and hence fluctuations in the black body radiation pressure. Reversing the argument shows that there must be a route for the return of energy from the fluctuating black body radiation field back to the gas molecules. Given the known shape of the radiation field given by Planck's law, Einstein could calculate the mean square energy fluctuation of the black body radiation. He found the root mean square energy fluctuation \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\epsilon ^2 \\\\right\\\\rangle in a small volume v of a cavity filled with thermal radiation in the frequency interval between u and u + d u to be a function of frequency and temperature: : \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\epsilon ^2 ( u, T) \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left( h u \\\\rho + \\\\frac{c^3}{8 \\\\pi u ^2} \\\\rho^2 \\\\right) v d u , where \\\\rho v d u would be the average energy of the volume in contact with the thermal bath. The above expression has two terms, the second corresponding to the classical Rayleigh-Jeans law (i.e. a wavelike term), and the first corresponding to the Wien distribution law (which from Einstein's 1905 analysis, would result from point-like quanta with energy h u . From this, Einstein concluded that radiation had simultaneous wave and particle aspects. =Bubble paradox= Einstein from 1905 to 1923 was virtually the only physicist who took light-quanta seriously. Throughout most of this period, the physics community treated the light-quanta hypothesis with \\"skepticism bordering on derision\\" and maintained this attitude even after Einstein's photoelectric law was validated. The citation for Einstein's 1922 Nobel Prize very deliberately avoided all mention of light-quanta, instead stating that it was being awarded for \\"his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\\". This dismissive stance contrasts sharply with the enthusiastic manner in which Einstein's other major contributions were accepted, including his work on Brownian motion, special relativity, general relativity, and his numerous other contributions to the \\"old\\" quantum theory. Various explanations have been given for this neglect on the part of the physics community. First and foremost was wave theory's long and indisputable success in explaining purely optical phenomena. Second was the fact that his 1905 paper, which pointed out that certain phenomena would be more readily explained under the assumption that light is particulate, presented the hypothesis only as a \\"heuristic viewpoint\\". The paper offered no compelling, comprehensive alternative to existing electromagnetic theory. Third was the fact that his 1905 paper introducing light quanta and his two 1909 papers that argued for a wave- particle fusion theory approached their subjects via statistical arguments that his contemporaries \\"might accept as theoretical exercise‚Äîcrazy, perhaps, but harmless\\". Most of Einstein's contemporaries adopted the position that light is ultimately a wave, but appears particulate in certain circumstances only because atoms absorb wave energy in discrete units. Bubble paradox Among the thought experiments that Einstein presented in his 1909 lecture on the nature and constitution of radiation was one that he used to point out the implausibility of the above argument. He used this thought experiment to argue that atoms emit light as discrete particles rather than as continuous waves: (a) An electron in a cathode ray beam strikes an atom in a target. The intensity of the beam is set so low that we can consider one electron at a time as impinging on the target. (b) The atom emits a spherically radiating electromagnetic wave. (c) This wave excites an atom in a secondary target, causing it to release an electron of energy comparable to that of the original electron. The energy of the secondary electron depends only on the energy of the original electron and not at all on the distance between the primary and secondary targets. All the energy spread around the circumference of the radiating electromagnetic wave would appear to be instantaneously focused on the target atom, an action that Einstein considered implausible. Far more plausible would be to say that the first atom emitted a particle in the direction of the second atom. Although Einstein originally presented this thought experiment as an argument for light having a particulate nature, it has been noted that this thought experiment, which has been termed the \\"bubble paradox\\", foreshadows the famous 1935 EPR paper. In his 1927 Solvay debate with Bohr, Einstein employed this thought experiment to illustrate that according to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics that Bohr championed, the quantum wavefunction of a particle would abruptly collapse like a \\"popped bubble\\" no matter how widely dispersed the wavefunction. The transmission of energy from opposite sides of the bubble to a single point would occur faster than light, violating the principle of locality. In the end, it was experiment, not any theoretical argument, that finally enabled the concept of the light quantum to prevail. In 1923, Arthur Compton was studying the scattering of high energy X-rays from a graphite target. Unexpectedly, he found that the scattered X-rays were shifted in wavelength, corresponding to inelastic scattering of the X-rays by the electrons in the target. His observations were totally inconsistent with wave behavior, but instead could only be explained if the X-rays acted as particles. This observation of the Compton effect rapidly brought about a change in attitude, and by 1926, the concept of the \\"photon\\" was generally accepted by the physics community. =Einstein's light box= Einstein did not like the direction in which quantum mechanics had turned after 1925. Although excited by Heisenberg's matrix mechanics, Schroedinger's wave mechanics, and Born's clarification of the meaning of the Schroedinger wave equation (i.e. that the absolute square of the wave function is to be interpreted as a probability density), his instincts told him that something was missing. In a letter to Born, he wrote: The Solvay Debates between Bohr and Einstein began in dining-room discussions at the Fifth Solvay International Conference on Electrons and Photons in 1927. Einstein's issue with the new quantum mechanics was not just that, with the probability interpretation, it rendered invalid the notion of rigorous causality. After all, as noted above, Einstein himself had introduced random processes in his 1916 theory of radiation. Rather, by defining and delimiting the maximum amount of information obtainable in a given experimental arrangement, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle denied the existence of any knowable reality in terms of a complete specification of the momenta and description of individual particles, an objective reality that would exist whether or not we could ever observe it. Over dinner, during after-dinner discussions, and at breakfast, Einstein debated with Bohr and his followers on the question whether quantum mechanics in its present form could be called complete. Einstein illustrated his points with increasingly clever thought experiments intended to prove that position and momentum could in principle be simultaneously known to arbitrary precision. For example, one of his thought experiments involved sending a beam of electrons through a shuttered screen, recording the positions of the electrons as they struck a photographic screen. Bohr and his allies would always be able to counter Einstein's proposal, usually by the end of the same day. On the final day of the conference, Einstein revealed that the uncertainty principle was not the only aspect of the new quantum mechanics that bothered him. Quantum mechanics, at least in the Copenhagen interpretation, appeared to allow action at a distance, the ability for two separated objects to communicate at speeds greater than light. By 1928, the consensus was that Einstein had lost the debate, and even his closest allies during the Fifth Solvay Conference, for example Louis de Broglie, conceded that quantum mechanics appeared to be complete. Einstein's light box At the Sixth Solvay International Conference on Magnetism (1930), Einstein came armed with a new thought experiment. This involved a box with a shutter that operated so quickly, it would allow only one photon to escape at a time. The box would first be weighed exactly. Then, at a precise moment, the shutter would open, allowing a photon to escape. The box would then be re- weighed. The well-known relationship between mass and energy E = m c^2 would allow the energy of the particle to be precisely determined. With this gadget, Einstein believed that he had demonstrated a means to obtain, simultaneously, a precise determination of the energy of the photon as well as its exact time of departure from the system. Bohr was shaken by this thought experiment. Unable to think of a refutation, he went from one conference participant to another, trying to convince them that Einstein's thought experiment could not be true, that if it were true, it would literally mean the end of physics. After a sleepless night, he finally worked out a response which, ironically, depended on Einstein's general relativity. Consider the illustration of Einstein's light box: :1. After emitting a photon, the loss of weight causes the box to rise in the gravitational field. :2. The observer returns the box to its original height by adding weights until the pointer points to its initial position. It takes a certain amount of time t for the observer to perform this procedure. How long it takes depends on the strength of the spring and on how well-damped the system is. If undamped, the box will bounce up and down forever. If over-damped, the box will return to its original position sluggishly (See Damped spring-mass system). :3. The longer that the observer allows the damped spring-mass system to settle, the closer the pointer will reach its equilibrium position. At some point, the observer will conclude that his setting of the pointer to its initial position is within an allowable tolerance. There will be some residual error \\\\Delta q in returning the pointer to its initial position. Correspondingly, there will be some residual error \\\\Delta m in the weight measurement. :4. Adding the weights imparts a momentum p to the box which can be measured with an accuracy \\\\Delta p delimited by \\\\Delta p \\\\Delta q \\\\approx h . It is clear that \\\\Delta p < gt \\\\Delta m , where g is the gravitational constant. Plugging in yields gt \\\\Delta m \\\\Delta q > h . :5. General relativity informs us that while the box has been at a height different than its original height, it has been ticking at a rate different than its original rate. The red shift formula informs us that there will be an uncertainty \\\\Delta t = c^{-2} g t \\\\Delta q in the determination of t_0 , the emission time of the photon. :6. Hence, c^2 \\\\Delta m \\\\Delta t = \\\\Delta E \\\\Delta t > h . The accuracy with which the energy of the photon is measured restricts the precision with which its moment of emission can be measured, following the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. After finding his last attempt at finding a loophole around the uncertainty principle refuted, Einstein quit trying to search for inconsistencies in quantum mechanics. Instead, he shifted his focus to the other aspects of quantum mechanics with which he was uncomfortable, focusing on his critique of action at a distance. His next paper on quantum mechanics foreshadowed his later paper on the EPR paradox. Einstein was gracious in his defeat. The following September, Einstein nominated Heisenberg and Schroedinger for the Nobel Prize, stating, \\"I am convinced that this theory undoubtedly contains a part of the ultimate truth.\\" =EPR Paradox= Einstein's fundamental dispute with quantum mechanics was not about whether God rolled dice, whether the uncertainty principle allowed simultaneous measurement of position and momentum, or even whether quantum mechanics was complete. It was about reality. Does a physical reality exist independent of our ability to observe it? To Bohr and his followers, such questions were meaningless. All that we can know are the results of measurements and observations. It makes no sense to speculate about an ultimate reality that exists beyond our perceptions. Einstein's beliefs had evolved over the years from those that he had held when he was young, when, as a logical positivist heavily influenced by his reading of David Hume and Ernst Mach, he had rejected such unobservable concepts as absolute time and space. Einstein believed: :1. A reality exists independent of our ability to observe it. :2. Objects are located at distinct points in spacetime and have their own independent, real existence. In other words, he believed in separability and locality. :3. Although at a superficial level, quantum events may appear random, at some ultimate level, strict causality underlies all processes in nature. EPR paradox thought experiment. (top) The total wave function of a particle pair spreads from the collision point. (bottom) Observation of one particle collapses the wave function. Einstein considered that realism and localism were fundamental underpinnings of physics. After leaving Nazi Germany and settling in Princeton at the Institute for Advanced Studies, Einstein began writing up a thought experiment that he had been mulling over since attending a lecture by L√©on Rosenfeld in 1933. Since the paper was to be in English, Einstein enlisted the help of the 46-year-old Boris Podolsky, a fellow who had moved to the Institute from Caltech; he also enlisted the help of the 26-year-old Nathan Rosen, also at the Institute, who did much of the math. The result of their collaboration was the four page EPR paper, which in its title asked the question Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete? After seeing the paper in print, Einstein found himself unhappy with the result. His clear conceptual visualization had been buried under layers of mathematical formalism. Einstein's thought experiment involved two particles that have collided or which have been created in such a way that they have properties which are correlated. The total wave function for the pair links the positions of the particles as well as their linear momenta. The figure depicts the spreading of the wave function from the collision point. However, observation of the position of the first particle allows us to determine precisely the position of the second particle no matter how far the pair have separated. Likewise, measuring the momentum of the first particle allows us to determine precisely the momentum of the second particle. \\"In accordance with our criterion for reality, in the first case we must consider the quantity P as being an element of reality, in the second case the quantity Q is an element of reality.\\" Einstein concluded that the second particle, which we have never directly observed, must have at any moment a position that is real and a momentum that is real. Quantum mechanics does not account for these features of reality. Therefore, quantum mechanics is not complete. It is known, from the uncertainty principle, that position and momentum cannot be measured at the same time. But even though their values can only be determined in distinct contexts of measurement, can they both be definite at the same time? Einstein concluded that the answer must be yes. The only alternative, claimed Einstein, would be to assert that measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle. \\"No reasonable definition of reality could be expected to permit this.\\" Bohr was stunned when he read Einstein's paper and spent more than six weeks framing his response, which he gave exactly the same title as the EPR paper. The EPR paper forced Bohr to make a major revision in his understanding of complementarity in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. Prior to EPR, Bohr had maintained that disturbance caused by the act of observation was the physical explanation for quantum uncertainty. In the EPR thought experiment, however, Bohr had to admit that \\"there is no question of a mechanical disturbance of the system under investigation.\\" On the other hand, he noted that the two particles were one system described by one quantum function. Furthermore, the EPR paper did nothing to dispel the uncertainty principle. Later commentators have questioned the strength and coherence of Bohr's response. As a practical matter, however, physicists for the most part did not pay much attention to the debate between Bohr and Einstein, since the opposing views did not affect one's ability to apply quantum mechanics to practical problems, but only affected one's interpretation of the quantum formalism. If they thought about the problem at all, most working physicists tended to follow Bohr's leadership. So stood the situation for nearly 30 years. Then, in 1964, John Stewart Bell made the groundbreaking discovery that Einstein's local realist world view made experimentally verifiable predictions that would be in conflict with those of quantum mechanics. Bell's discovery shifted the Einstein‚ÄìBohr debate from philosophy to the realm of experimental physics. Bell's theorem showed that, for any local realist formalism, there exist limits on the predicted correlations between pairs of particles in an experimental realization of the EPR thought experiment. In 1972, the first experimental tests were carried out. Successive experiments improved the accuracy of observation and closed loopholes. To date, it is virtually certain that local realist theories have been falsified. So Einstein was wrong. But after decades of relative neglect, the EPR paper has been recognized as prescient, since it identified the phenomenon of quantum entanglement. It has several times been the case that Einstein's \\"mistakes\\" have foreshadowed and provoked major shifts in scientific research. Such, for instance, has been the case with his proposal of the cosmological constant, which Einstein considered his greatest blunder, but which currently is being actively investigated for its possible role in the accelerating expansion of the universe. In his Princeton years, Einstein was virtually shunned as he pursued the unified field theory. Nowadays, innumerable physicists pursue Einstein's dream for a \\"theory of everything.\\" The EPR paper did not prove quantum mechanics to be incorrect. What it did prove was that quantum mechanics, with its \\"spooky action at a distance,\\" is completely incompatible with commonsense understanding. Furthermore, the effect predicted by the EPR paper, quantum entanglement, has inspired approaches to quantum mechanics different from the Copenhagen interpretation, and has been at the forefront of major technological advances in quantum computing, quantum encryption, and quantum information theory.

(January 19, 1931 ‚Äì December 8, 2000) was an American dancer and choreographer known for her work in television, Broadway theater, and movies, including starring in the General Motors sponsored-film shorts \\"Design for Dreaming\\" (1956) and \\"A Touch of Magic\\" (1961). Early life Tadlock was born in Port Arthur, Texas, the daughter of Haydn H. and florist Thelma Tadlock. She trained for 15 years at the Florence Coleman School of Dance, and served as a football majorette for Thomas Jefferson High School, where she graduated in 1949. Career Tadlock moved to New York City in 1950 and made her Broadway debut as a dancer in the 1951 musical Make a Wish. Continuing her training at the Stanley School of Dance, she went on to the Broadway-musical hits Top Banana (1951), Pal Joey (1952), and Me and Juliet (1953), billed in all as Thelma Tadlock, and both dancing and playing character roles in the latter two. She then began work in television and film, working as a dancer and choreographer for decades, initially on TV's Your Hit Parade and The Arthur Murray Party. Later billed as Tad Tadlock, she worked on Dance Fever, The Dream Merchants, Charlie's Angels, Cheers and other programs, including Ziegfeld: The Man and His Women, and such events as the 1988 Miss Universe pageant and the 1989 Super Bowl halftime show. Her movies included Heaven's Gate (as \\"additional choreographer\\"), Body Heat and Irreconcilable Differences. Tadlock also worked as a spokeswoman, actress, model, and dancer in numerous commercials, including for United Airlines. Tadlock and Marc Breaux in \\"Design for Dreaming\\" (1956) She as well performed in multimedia presentations for clients including Toyota, and is perhaps best known for two General Motors sponsored-film shorts that have become cult classics: the musicals \\"Design for Dreaming\\" (1956), directed by William Beaudine, and \\"A Touch of Magic\\" (1961), directed by Victor D. Solow. In the first, which has gone on to be excerpted and sampled in a host of media, Tadlock plays an unnamed woman who dreams about a masked man (dancer and choreographer Marc Breaux) taking her to the 1956 General Motors Motorama at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, and to Frigidaire's \\"Kitchen of the Future\\". It was included in a fifth-season episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1994. In the equally highly stylized \\"A Touch of Magic\\", Tadlock plays a medieval woman menaced by a dragon and rescued by a knight. She and the man then suddenly become a modern-day suburban couple with a magical kitchen, hosting a housewarming party attended by invisible guests, and then dancing dreamily on a cloud. Personal life In June 1960, in New York City, Tadlock married George Vosburgh Jr., an assistant director of the 1958 feature documentary Windjammer and later a TV game-show producer. Her reception was held in the home of talk- show host and TV personality Merv Griffin. Following her marriage, she was billed at least once as Tad Tadlock Vosburgh. Tadlock was living in Tarzana, California, at the time of her death from cancer. Legacy The Museum of the Gulf Coast maintains a Tad Tadlock permanent exhibit.

More similar to a burrito than to a taco, and claiming inspiration from Mexican cuisine, it originated from the region of Rh√¥ne-Alpes in France in the early 2000s, before becoming popular among teenagers and young adults in all of France and abroad.  Description  Despite the name, the French tacos has little to do with the taco and may in fact be more similar to a burrito; it also has been compared to the panini and the d√∂ner kebab sandwich. It consists of a flour tortilla wrapped or folded in a rectangular shape around a filling which usually includes: * various types of meat, such as chicken, turkey or beef, in the form of mince, escalopes, chicken nuggets, d√∂ner kebab, cordon bleu, turkey lardons, etc.; * French fries; * cheese, be it any type of French cheese or cheddar, processed cheese (specifically American cheese) or a cheese sauce may be used instead; * an additional relish, which is generally any of ketchup, mayonnaise, BBQ sauce, or other sauces usually available in kebab shops; * vegetables, generally in the form of salad mix, but also in other forms such as shakshouka. It is then served warmed by grilling (with the use of a panini grill) or toasting. Many different recipes exist, and it is common for French tacos restaurants to deliver made to order products by letting customers choose √† la carte from the aforementioned ingredients. Meat-free variants also exist. Most French tacos made in France are marketed as halal-certified, and as such do not contain pork, in order to accommodate Muslim customers.  History  There are conflicting accounts about the exact origin of the French tacos. According to Moroccan magazine TelQuel, it was invented in the mid-2000s by Moroccan-born brothers Abdelhadi and Mohammed Moubarek as they were running a kebab shop in Savoy. French documentary series 66 minutes, on the other hand, credits Mohamed Soualhi, founder of the chain Tacos Avenue (formerly Tacos King) with inventing the sandwich in Lyon in the late 2000s. However, Soualhi himself, as well as other sources, have affirmed that \\"French tacos\\" were first sighted in fast food restaurants in the city of Vaulx-en-Velin near Lyon in the early 2000s. By the late 2000s, French tacos had become popular among teenagers and young adults in Rh√¥ne-Alpes. Years later, their popularity spread to the rest of France as dedicated chains ran massive ad campaigns, with the help of social media and celebrity endorsements. In 2013, the Moubarek brothers opened the first French-tacos-dedicated restaurant in Morocco, \\"Tacos de Lyon\\" in Mers Sultan. The sandwich later became popular among young adults in the major cities of the Kingdom. Similar restaurants were opened in other countries such as Senegal. = Name origin = The origin of the name \\"French tacos\\" is subject to as much speculation as the sandwich itself. Daniel Shkolnik of Vice describes the naming as tacos as \\"a kind of marketing bait-and-switch, drawing people with the promise of a Mexican culinary icon and then selling them something completely different.\\" As its popularity grew, the sandwich was gradually branded as tacos fran√ßais to tell it apart from the original taco. In turn, the taco is sometimes referred to in France as \\"Mexican taco\\" () to emphasize the difference between the two dishes.

The Seattle Seahawks immediately announced their decision to convert Flowers from safety to cornerback. On May 17, 2018, the Seattle Seahawks signed Flowers to a four-year, $2.75 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $298,729. Flowers entered training camp as a backup cornerback, but began competing for a job as the starting cornerback after he quickly transitioned to the position and impressed the coaching staff. He competed for the starting cornerback job against veterans Byron Maxwell and Dontae Johnson. Head coach Pete Carroll named Flowers a starting cornerback after injuries to both Maxwell and Johnson. He was named a starter alongside Shaquill Griffin and safeties Bradley McDougald and Earl Thomas. He made his professional regular season debut and first career start in the Seattle Seahawks' season opener at the Denver Broncos, and recorded eight combined tackles and a pass deflection in their 27-24 loss. Flowers primarily covered Pro Bowl wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders during the game and allowed 10 receptions on 11 targets for 135 yards and a 43-yard touchdown. Flowers was inactive for the Seahawks' Week 2 loss at the Chicago Bears due to a hamstring injury. Personal life Flowers is the cousin of former Jacksonville Jaguars fullback Dimitri Flowers, who is currently with the Dallas Renegades.

As Giorgio Bentami he pursued a professional opera and concert career in Europe and Britain from 1868 to 1877. Alexis proved to be his last role.G√§nzl, Kurt. \\"David Stone's Three Wishes: Number Two ... granted!\\", Kurt G√§nzl's blog, 25 April 2018 Early life Bentham was born in York in 1843, the youngest child and only son of Captain (later Lieutenant-Colonel) John Bentham (died 1858), who served in the 6th Dragoon Guards and the 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot, among others, and his wife Emma Sophia (n√©e Ikin). The family was well-connected and rich. Bentham gained a post in the War Office, and, being possessed of a fine tenor voice, by 1866 he became involved in amateur high society concerts, the first recorded being given by the Margate Volunteers at the local Assembly Rooms. Of his performance the local press wrote: \\"Rarely do concert-goers hear such a tenor as Mr Bentham ... his singing of 'The Message' was something superb.\\" A few weeks later at Torquay he sang in a concert given by \\"The Wandering Minstrels\\", then the leading gentlemen's amateur singing club in Britain. Among his other appearances with the group was one the same season at the West London School of Art. Later the same year he appeared in a concert given by the Civil Service Musical Society at the Hanover Square Rooms in London, where a critic commented: \\"Besides possessing a voice to excite envy, Mr Bentham has real musical feeling and sings with expression as true as it is unaffected.\\"\\"Civil Service Musical Society\\", The Musical World, 31 March 1866, p. 205 Career By 1868 Bentham, often performing as Signor Bentami, had become a professional singer in Europe and was appearing in Copenhagen, in Il Trovatore and Rigoletto, where his performance of the former was described as \\"a great surprise ‚Ä¶ a soft, sonorous, sympathetic voice ... intonation as pure as the sound of a silver bell\\". In October of that year, he was in Amsterdam, where English reports called him the \\"primo tenore in the opera of the city\\", and later that year he was a leading tenor at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm for ten weeks. He next appeared in Italy. George Bentham as Alexis (left) and Giulia Warwick as Aline in The Sorcerer (1878) He returned to Britain and signed a three-year contract with James Henry Mapleson. In Scotland, with Mapleson's Italian opera company in early 1871, he sang the roles of Count Almaviva in The Barber of Seville and Elvino in La sonnambula. The critic of The Glasgow Herald commented that despite the new tenor's palpable lack of stage experience, he was \\"a decided success\\", singing with \\"pure and refined taste ‚Ä¶ sweet, telling voice and gentlemanly bearing\\".\\"Theatre Royal ‚Äì Italian Opera\\", The Glasgow Herald, 3 March 1871, p. 4 Bentham made his London d√©but in April 1871 in the role of Carlo in Linda di Chamounix. He was still billed as \\"Signor Bentami\\", but the London critics were not deceived, and after they made this clear he abandoned the pseudo- Italian stage name and appeared under his real name.\\"Her Majesty's Opera\\", The Pall Mall Gazette, 27 March 1871, p. 11; \\"Her Majesty's Opera, Drury-Lane\\", The Era, 9 April 1871, p. 11; and \\"The Operas\\", The Pall Mall Gazette\\", 17 April 1871, p. 12 He then appeared in various concerts alongside such London stars as Th√©r√®se Tietjens and Sims Reeves. He returned to the operatic stage later that year playing Idreno in Semiramide at Her Majesty's Theatre. He soon sang Lionel in Martha. He also appeared that year at the Three Choirs Festival in GloucesterSimpson, Adrienne. Alice May: Gilbert & Sullivan's First Prima Donna, Routledge (2004), p. 86, in violation of his Mapleson contract. On 8 September 1871 at All Saints Church in Kensington he married the 20 year-old mezzo-soprano Cecile Fernandez. Back with Mapleson, in Dublin, Bentham appeared as Tamino in The Magic Flute while his new wife played Smeton in Anna Bolena. Again feuding with Mapleson, they sang together in concert in Dover, with The Hall√© in Manchester and at The Crystal Palace in London, before departing to appear in Italy where, among other roles, he played the title role in Faust and she played Marguerita. Their son, Jack A. Bentham, was born in Florence in 1873. After this, the couple separated. On returning to London alone Bentham again appeared in Monday Pops and other London concerts, including at the Royal Albert Hall. In 1874 he returned to Mapleson at Her Majesty‚Äôs Theatre in the title role of Faust, to familiar reviews: \\"To be frank, there is yet something to acquire and something to discard ere Mr Bentham will take that position which his excellent voice should enable him to do ultimately.\\" He next played Tamino in The Magic Flute. He returned to the Gloucester festival and was a soloist at the Liverpool Festival and the Leeds Music Festival, conducted by Sir Michael Costa, and also sang in Edinburgh that year. In early 1875 he sang in Elijah at the Royal Albert Hall, while in 1876 he toured with the Imperial Italian Opera Company, with whom he sang Alfredo in La Traviata, opposite Emma Howson. In early 1877, he sang in a starry concert party for Mapleson, earning warm reviews. In November 1877 Bentham was engaged by Richard D'Oyly Carte to create the role of Alexis in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera, The Sorcerer, at the Opera Comique in London.Rollins and Witts, p. 5 His singing on the opening night was hampered by a bad cold, but even after he had recovered, the critics found his performance disappointing, marked by wooden acting and pallid characterisation.Joseph, pp. 33‚Äì34 In March 1878, at Arthur Sullivan's request, he was asked to join Carte's touring company playing the opera in the British provinces;Young, pp. 110‚Äì111 George Power took over the role of Alexis in London. Bentham played Alexis on tour until July 1878 when he left the company.Rollins and Witts, p. 29Stone, David. George Bentham, Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 15 March 2010, accessed 28 April 2018 Last years and death Following this, at the age of 34, Bentham gave up his singing career. His wife and he apparently never reconciled and never divorced. She continued to perform as Madame Bentham-Fernandez, or Fernandez- Bentami, or under her maiden name, until at least 1913.\\"Signora Guerrina Fabbri\\", The Pall Mall Gazette, 27 June 1913, p. 7 Bentham died, aged 67, a man of \\"independent means and no fixed abode\\", at the Strand Palace Hotel in 1911 from fatty degeneration of the heart leading to a sudden heart failure. Although he had the disease for some years, his death certificate reports that he had been ill \\"for a few minutes\\".

It is bordered by Gandhi Nagar, Indira Nagar, Buckingham Canal and Tharamani. History Kasturba Nagar was established in 1949 by Daniel Thomas, Local Administration Minister in the Omandur Ramaswamy Reddiar cabinet. Thomas' original plan was to construct a large middle-class housing colony in the city. His efforts led to the establishment of Gandhi Nagar which had 332 housing plots. However, the demand for housing in the neighborhood was so high that Thomas decided to acquire another 130 acres towards the south to establish Kasturba Nagar. Present Day Kasturba Nagar is today a thriving neighborhood that serves as a gateway to the 45 kilometer long IT corridor along Rajiv Gandhi Salai. The Chennai branch of UNICEF is located in Kasturba Nagar along with several commercial establishments, hospitals and banks.

Payne and formerly Norlander had worked together in Asia Featuring John Payne, an offshoot of British progressive rock group Asia of which Payne was a member from 1991 to 2006, when Asia's original lineup reunited. Following Asia lead singer John Wetton's death on 31 January 2017, Payne and Norlander formed Dukes of the Orient as a vehicle to release new material, both out of respect for Wetton, and to distinguish themselves from Payne's former band. Asia Featuring John Payne remains active in a touring capacity, and members and former members of the group; Jay Schellen, Bruce Bouillet, Guthrie Govan, Jeff Kollman and Moni Scaria, have contributed to Dukes of the Orient's debut album. History =Origins= Payne has played with various rock and progressive rock outfits since the late 70s, including touring the UK with the Jimi Hendrix-inspired Moonstone and CCCP, as well as working with Roger Daltrey, and ELO Part II. In 1991, Payne joined British progressive rock group Asia, to replace their original lead singer and bassist John Wetton. Meanwhile in the 90s, Norlander was performing with his band Rocket Scientists, as well as working on collaborations with his wife Lana Lane. Payne remained as Asia's frontman until 2006, when Asia's original lineup reunited, including Wetton returning to replace Payne, a split that Payne has described as \\"painful\\". Following this, Payne formed GPS with fellow expelled Asia members Guthrie Govan (guitars) and Jay Schellen (drums), with Ryo Okumoto of Spock's Beard on keyboards. In 2007, Payne, along with Govan and Schellen also formed Asia Featuring John Payne, a continuation of Asia prior to the reunion minus original Asia keyboardist Geoff Downes. Norlander was brought in as the group's keyboardist. =2007-2017: Asia Featuring John Payne, work towards new album= Asia Featuring John Payne c.2012; left-to- right: Jay Schellen, Norlander, Payne, and Bruce Bouillet Asia Featuring John Payne went on numerous US tours with songs from the Asia catalogue, as well as working on new material in the studio. Having received a record deal from Sony Music Entertainment, the band embarked on recording a new album under the name Architects of Time (a name that was eventually given to a Payne solo project) and later Americana In 2009 they released an EP entitled \\"Military Man\\", featuring re-recorded \\"2009 versions\\" of Asia songs from Payne's time in the band. In 2012, after several lineup changes, the band also released a new music video for a song entitled \\"Seasons Will Change\\", intended for the new album. Norlander stated in a 2016 interview with music website Ready To Rock that he had stopped working with the band in 2013. =2017-19: Formation, release of first album= On 14 December 2017, Payne's official Facebook page announced the release of a \\"Payne/Norlander album\\" entitled Dukes of the Orient on Frontier Records, to be released on 28 February 2018. On 24 February, another Facebook post on Payne's Facebook page announced that Dukes of the Orient was indeed \\"a new band\\". The previously-released Asia Featuring John Payne single \\"Seasons Will Change\\" appeared on the self-titled album, with the band's website stating that new Asia Featuring John Payne material will be released under Dukes of the Orient, out of respect for Asia frontman John Wetton (who had died on 31 January 2017), and to distinguish themselves from the original Asia. The album was released on 28 February as stated, and featured contributions former and current members of Asia Featuring John Payne; Jay Schellen, Bruce Bouillet, Guthrie Govan, Jeff Kollman and Moni Scaria. =2019-present: Second album= On 20 June 2019, Payne shared on the group's Facebook page.

Emilii Plater) was a unit of the Soviet First Polish Army during the Second World War. Formed in 1943 it was intended as a front-line combat unit but was relegated mainly to police and sentry duty. It existed until the end of the war in May 1945, whereupon it comprised 500 members.  Formation Emilia Plater for whom the unit was named The unit was formed on 15 July 1943 as an all-female unit of the Soviet Polish Army. Its personnel were drawn from women deported from Soviet-occupied Poland and communist volunteers. There was no shortage of volunteers from among the internees, many of whom were eager to escape the poor conditions of their imprisonment. This was the first all- female Polish unit and had originally been opposed by the Soviet authorities who only relented when General Anders pointed out the widespread use of women in the Soviet Army. The battalion was named after Emilia Plater, a female Polish-Lithuanian leader who had fought against the Russians in the 1830 November Uprising. The individual soldiers were nicknamed the Plater√≥wski. The commanders of the unit were men but its political officers were women.  History  The unit numbered 690 women when it was formed. It originally formed part of the Polish 1st Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko Infantry Division but from 19 August 1943 was transferred to the I Polish Corps (this formation became the First Polish Army on 17 July 1944). It was intended to be used as a front-line combat unit but issues with training and possibly a reluctance by its commanders to risk large-scale female combat losses meant that it was relegated largely to sentry and military police duty. It also carried out medical and communications duties and provided training to women working elsewhere in the Polish Army. Some women officers of the battalion commanded all-male combat platoons within other formations. At the war's end in May 1945 the battalion comprised around 500 women, with 70 having been killed in service. The only woman ever decorated with the Gold Star of the Hero of the Soviet Union who was not a Soviet citizen is Aniela Krzywo≈Ñ, a member of this unit, after she died of injuries sustained while rescuing important military documents from a burning truck after a Luftwaffe bombing raid. Women veterans of the unit successfully sued Polish journalist and author Henryk Piecuch for slander in the 1990s after he claimed the battalion was organised solely to provide sexual services to male officers.  Organisation Upon its formation the battalion comprised: *Command unit *Five companies 1st Infantry 2nd Infantry Fusilier Machine gun Anti-tank *Six platoons Mortar Reconnaissance Signals Medical Engineer Logistics Transport (added late in 1943)  References  Category:Military history of Poland during World War II Category:Military units and formations established in 1943 Category:Military units and formations of Poland in World War II Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1945 Category:Poland‚ÄìSoviet Union relations Category:All-female military units and formations ","title":"Emilia Plater Independent Women's Battalion"},{"id":"57264711","text":"Ole Olsen Scheistr√∏en (16 August 1833 - 4 February 1921) was a Norwegian architect and builder. Scheistr√∏en had no formal architectural education and he, in fact, referred to himself as a builder and not an architect. However, he designed about 50 Norwegian churches, in addition to designing twelve churches after drawings by other architects, including six by Jacob Wilhelm Nordan. Biography Ole Olsen Scheistr√∏en was born on 16 August 1833 in the village of Skei (historically spelled Schei) in what is now the municipality of Surnadal in M√∏re og Romsdal county, Norway. He was born to Ole Olsen Scheistr√∏en and Rannei Pedersdatter √òyan. In 1864, he married Maria Jakobsdatter Otnes. He died in the town of Namsos on 4 February 1921. Career Scheistr√∏en learned the trade from his father, a farmer and a carpenter; working together with him until around 1863. Then he worked as an independent builder. In 1851 the Storting adopted a new law on the expansion of churches and cemeteries. A requirement in the law was that all churches should accommodate at least 30% of the members in the parish. This requirement prompted many existing churches to be rebuilt, expanded, or replaced by new ones. This new law gave architects and construction managers a lot of new work for decades to come. From 1863 until 1874, Scheistr√∏en built four churches in Nordm√∏re, three of which followed drawings by the famous architect Jacob Wilhelm Nordan. In 1874, the Scheistr√∏en made original drawings for the new S√∏mna Church in Helgeland. This was the first church he designed himself. It was a simple timber church with decorative details in Neo-Gothic and Swiss chalet style, strongly inspired by Nordan's architecture. Several of the churches that Scheistr√∏en later designed were similar with slight variations to the Nordan buildings he had worked on Nordm√∏re when he first started out as an architect. In 1884, Scheistr√∏en and his wife moved from Surnadal to Namsos. The churches he designed and built in Tr√∏ndelag and Northern Norway after moving, were built using a similar design to what he used for the S√∏mna Church. Scheistr√∏en participated in the rebuilding of the town of Namsos after the fire of 1897 but most of his work there was lost during the bombing of Namsos in 1940.

Gerritdina Letteboer opted to begin her own family when she wed Johan Benders (1907‚Äì1943) sometime during the mid to late 1930s. A native of Bloemendaal, he would go on to become an active member of the Dutch Resistance during World War II while continuing his work as a teacher at the Amsterdams Lyceum. They settled in Amstelveen in the Netherlands province of North Holland, and greeted the arrival of their first child in 1939.Johan Benders, The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation.‚ÄùGerritdina Benders-Letteboer and Johan Benders, De geschiedenis van het Humanitarisme in Nederland. World War II Gerritdina Benders- Letteboer and her husband, Johan Benders, became active members of the Dutch Resistance in response to the invasion and occupation of the Netherlands by Germany in May 1940, and the expulsion of Jewish students from the Amsterdams Lyceum as part of a series of persecution laws enacted against Dutch Jewish citizens.Benders, Johan & Gerritdina (Letterboer), Righteous Among the Nations, Yad Vashem.Johan Benders, The Righteous During the Holocaust, Holocaust Memorial Center, Zekelman Family Campus. Teaching student Tineke Guilonard and other older members of his classes how to forge identity papers and food ration cards for Jewish people to help them avoid this persecution, Johan Benders also encouraged his wife to turn their home into a hiding place for Jewish men, women and children. Among those finding refuge at the Benders‚Äô home were two of Benders‚Äô former pupils, Rosalie and Katie Wijnberg, Jewish sisters who had left their parents‚Äô home in the Dutch East Indies to reside with an aunt in the Netherlands, and suddenly found themselves at risk of persecution and deportation. They remained at the Benders‚Äô home through the Netherlands‚Äô Liberation. In 1941, the Benders greeted the arrival of their second child. By 1943, they were also sheltering Lore Polak, who ultimately survived the war and emigrated to America.‚ÄùBep Meijer Zion (middle), on her honeymoon in New York, poses on a park bench with her sister, Renee Meijer Beck (left), and a friend, Lore Polak‚Äù (photograph number: 25315). Washington, D.C.: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. That same year (1943), a neighbor who was a Nazi sympathizer alerted Dutch and German officials to the Benders‚Äô resistance activities. In response, the Geheime Staatspolizei (known more commonly as the \\"Gestapo\\") raided the Benders‚Äô home on April 4, 1943, arrested Johan Benders, Lore Polak and Katie Wijnberg, and jailed them. At the time of his arrest, Johan Benders had a list in his pocket with the coded names and addresses of 18 Jewish people he had helped hide; Gerritdina Benders-Letteboer was five months pregnant and the mother of two young daughters. Charged with stealing from the registrar's office at his school, Johan Benders was incarcerated at the Amstelveenseweg prison, and housed in a cell with Dutch poet Gerrit Kouwenaar. Fearful that he would break under the Nazi torture to which he was being subjected, and determined not to reveal the hiding places of the Jewish people he and his wife had hidden, Benders attempted suicide twice while in jail before finally succeeding in ending his own life on April 6, 1943 by jumping from the third floor of the prison where he was being interrogated and tortured. In protest, \\"many of Johan‚Äôs former students marched past the jail whistling the school song,\\" according to Yad Vashem. The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation notes that Johan Benders was a hero to the end, having never revealed the names or addresses of the Jewish people he had helped to save. Westerbork Transit Camp, The Netherlands (c. 1940‚Äì1945, army photograph, public domain)Meanwhile, Lore Polak and Katie Wijnberg were sent to the Nazi transit camp at Westerbork to await deportation to a German concentration camp. Following her husband‚Äôs death, Gerritdina Benders-Letteboer continued on with their resistance and rescue work. After searching for and finding Lore Polak, who had escaped from the concentration camp where she had been deported, she returned her to the safety of her home, and then sought out another of her husband‚Äôs former students, Jan Doedens, and brought her into hiding to prevent her deployment via the Arbeitseinsatz, which forced Dutch citizens to work as slave laborers. Katie Wijnberg also then became part of the reconstituted family when she was released from Westerbork.

At 9:14, two telephoned warnings were issued, saying that two bombs had been planted: one outside and one inside Harrods. The store was due to open at 10:00. Police cordoned off the area and began a search. However, some bystanders ignored the police cordon. At about 9:40, a package containing 1 lb of Semtex exploded in a litter bin at the front of the store. It injured four people and damaged the shopfront. The cost of damage and lost sales was estimated at ¬£1 million. Harrods was previously targeted in 1974 and 1983, but the 1993 bomb was much smaller than the 1983 one. Perpetrators Those responsible were English Irish nationalist activists associated with the Provisional IRA: Jan Taylor, a 51-year-old former corporal who had served in the British Army Royal Signals Corps, and Patrick Hayes, a 41-year-old computer programmer of Irish descent, with a degree in business studies from Polytechnic of Central London and a member of Red Action. In March 1993, police captured them at Hayes' home in Stoke Newington, London. They each received prison sentences of 30 years for the January Harrods bombing and for a second attack on a train a month later which caused extensive damage but no casualties. Hayes was also convicted of conspiracy to cause three additional explosions in 1992. Neither man had any apparent links to Ireland beyond their \\"unswerving support for the IRA\\".

Edith Robinson was born in Croydon, Surrey, to Quaker parents. In the 1880s Robinson was working as an art teacher and earning extra money through selling watercolours, primarily depicting cottage gardens and flowers.Rhoda Bickerdike (nee Dawson), \\"The Dawsons: An Equal Partnership of Artists,\\" Apollo, November 1988, p. 321. In 1893 she married Nelson Dawson in London. He was an architecturally trained painter and metalworker. The two had met in an art shop in Scarborough, where Dawson was working as an assistant.Charlotte Gere and Geoffry Munn (1989), Artists' Jewellery: Pre- Raphaelite to Arts and Crafts, The Antique Collectors Club In the early 1890s Nelson Dawson attended a series of lectures on enamelling given by Alexander Fisher. It is unclear whether he then taught Edith the skill or whether they attended the lectures together.Toni Lesser Wolf, \\"Women Jewelers of the British Arts and Crafts Movement\\", The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts, Vol 14 (Autumn 1989), p.33 The two subsequently collaborated on jewellery, with Edith Dawson creating the enamels and Nelson Dawson the metalwork. Edith Dawson was a perfectionist and her enamels are of exceptionally high quality, with a delicate, jewel-like appearance that is easily recognisable. Examples of the Dawsons' work can be found in the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The couple moved to Chiswick where they set up a workshop. During the busiest years they employed up to twenty craftsmen. In 1900 they exhibited 125 pieces of jewellery at the Fine Art Society in Bond Street. However, by 1914 the couple were in financial difficulties and they reduced their metalwork output. They continued to create, and in 1917 exhibited several commemorative and heraldic plaques at the Royal Academy including one bearing the Arms of Trinity College, Cambridge in bronze and champlev√© enamel. In 1905 Edith Dawson published a small book entitled A Little Book on Art: Enamel.

It features a series of exhibitions, performances, and academic projects that explore the interconnecting structures and process of mathematics and art, and language, as way to advance a movement of mathematical expression across the arts, across creative collaborative communities celebrating the rhythm and patterns of both ideas of the mind and the physical reality of nature. Introduction Rhythm of Structure, as an expanding series of art exhibitions, performances, videos/films and publications created and curated by multimedia mathematical artist and writer John Sims, explores and celebrates the intersecting structures of mathematics, art, community, and nature. Sims also created Recoloration Proclamation featuring the installation, The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag (2004). From his catalog essay from the Rhythm of Structure: Mathematics, Art and Poetic exhibition, Sims sets the curatorial theme where he writes: \\"Mathematics, as a parameter of human consciousness in an indispensable conceptual technology, essential is seeing beyond the retinal and knowing beyond the intuitive. The language and process of mathematics, as elements of, foundation for art, inform an analytic expressive condition that inspires a visual reckoning for a convergence: from the illustrative to the metaphysical to the poetic. And in the dialectic of visual art call and text performative response, there is an inter-dimensional conversation where the twisting structures of language, vision and human ways give birth to the spiritual lattice of a social geometry, a community constructivism  a place of connections, where emotional calculations meet spirited abstraction.\\" First premiering at the Fire Patrol No.5 Gallery in 2003, with the show Rhythm of Structure: MathArt in Harlem. This interdisciplinary project has featured numerous exhibitions around the country collaborating with many notable artists, writers, and musicians including: Sol Lewitt, Adrian Piper, Dorothea Rockburne, Al Loving,Joe Overstreet, Howardena Pindell, Helaman Ferguson, John Hiigli, Vandorn Hinnant, Karen Finley, Dread Scott, Paul D. Miller, Bob Holman, Kate Rushin, Roman Verostko, Joan Waltemath, Tara Betts, Brent Collins, Mike Field, Kazmier Maslanka, Ken Hiratsuka, Yael Acher Moriano, Richard Kostelanetz, Kristin Prevallet, John Sims, and former U.S. Poet Laureate Mark Strand. In addition to the exhibitions, another major aim of Rhythm of Structure is the building of an interdisciplinary creative community around the intersection of mathematics and all forms of art, as it might inspire new art, innovation art and mathematics education, and increased respect and understanding of the rhythm and structure of nature itself. Such community experiences are created through call and response performances, social media and special video music projects such as The Rhythm of Structure and The Pi Day Anthem featuring John Sims and Vi Hart . Background Rhythm of Structure has its beginnings in Sims‚Äô work as one of the international curators for the exhibition Science in the Arts - Art in the Sciences, a citywide exhibition, in conjunction with the UNESCO-ICSU World Conference of Science, Budapest, Hungary in 1999. This led to the exhibition, MathArt/ArtMath, curated by John Sims (then Coordinator of Mathematics at Ringling) and Kevin Dean, at the Selby Gallery Ringling College of Art and Design in 2002. This show presented a general survey of art inspired and framed by mathematics ideas of mostly American modern and contemporary artists, as well as mathematicians working in the area of visual mathematics. The theme of the show was designed to examine the complexity and diversity of the meaning of mathematical art. The MathArt/ArtMath exhibition featured: Josef Albers, Thomas Banchoff, Richard Anuszkiewicz, Manuelo Baez, Jhane Barnes, Max Bill, Mel Bochner, Brent Collins, David Davis, George Deem, Agnes Denes, M.C. Escher, Fred Eversley, Shannon Fagan, Helaman Ferguson, Mike Field, Charles Gaines, Paulus Gerdes, Bathsheba Grossman, Al Held, John Hiigli, Slavik Jablan, Alfred Jensen, Andrienne Klein, Sol LeWitt, Arthur Lee Loeb, Paul D. Miller aka DJ Spooky, Marlena Novak, Joe Overstreet, Howardena Pindell, Richard Purdy, Tony Robbin, Dorothea Rockburne, Frank Rothkamm, Irene Rousseau, Carlo Sequin, John Sims, John Sullivan, Jack Tworkov, Roman Verostko, and John Waltemath. There was a brochure and video produced for this exhibition. After the MathArt/ArtMath exhibition, Sims began working on a text about the nature of mathematical art leading to his chapter, Trees, Roots and a Brain: A Metaphorical Foundation for Mathematical Art, in the book Mathematics and Culture II: Visual Perfection: Mathematics and Creativity. In his chapter, he presents his ideas on the interconnection of mathematics, art and nature, setting the stage for his next group of exhibitions called Rhythm of Structure.

After the Selby Gallery showing at Ringling, it was shown later that year at the Antioch College, from May to November 2011. The Dayton City Paper reviewed the exhibition and featured an article in their local newspaper. Publications Rhythm of Structure Mathematics, Art and Poetic Reflection: Bowery and Beyond - Exhibition Catalogue In 2011, the catalog Rhythm of Structure Mathematics, Art and Poetic Reflection: Bowery and Beyond was produced by Selby Gallery and Antioch College Herndon Gallery at Ringling College of Art and Design and John Sims, containing all 9 of the Mathematics, Art and Poetic Reflection exhibits. Sarasota Herald Tribune previewed and reviewed the exhibition catalog at Selby Gallery, and the film at the Sarasota Film Festival. Rhythm of Structure: MathArt in the African Diaspora - International Review of African American Art In 2004, John Sims and Juliette Harris co-edited a special issue, MathArt in the African Diaspora, for the International Review of African American Art which featured artists: John Sims, Al Smith, Juliette Harris, Ron Eglash, Brent Collins, Andrea Pollan, Howardena Pindell, and Paulus Gerdes. NYU course In the spring of 2010, in connection to the Rhythm of Structure: Mathematics, Art and Poetic Reflection at the Bowery Poetry Club, John Sims was invited to teach a course for the department of Art and Public Policy at Tisch School of the Arts. The course, \\"Rhythm of Structure: Trees, Flags and Clock\\", examined the mechanisms/structures of developing John Sims' three large-scale interdisciplinary art projects (as case studies), which explored issues of social justice, community building, and the politics of grand scale works. With these multi-level projects-in-progress, which intersect the space of art with mathematics, visual politics, and social networking, the course investigated the various strategies and challenges in creating a system of objects-texts-sounds-works that employs the tools of social organizing, media, technology, culture jamming, performance, poetry, and satire. The student final group project was a collective video-poetry response to the Sol Lewitt and Adrian Piper exhibition, Selected Infinite Extensions Arbitrarily Constrained, which was up at that point at the Rhythm of Structure exhibition at the Bowery Poetry Club. The video and live student readings were also presented at the closing of the show. Film Mathematics, Art and Poetic Reflection was made into a documentary, Rhythm of Structure: Bowery and Beyond, and presented at Sarasota Film Festival in 2012. The film was also previewed and reviewed by the Saratosa Herald Tribune. In connection to the film screening, there was are dinner, art performance reception featuring John Sims and Karen Finley's Square of Love installation from the Rhythm of Structure exhibition at the Bowery Poetry Club. The dinner featured a special menu prepared by Chef Gene Marra inspired by roots and love. The performance program included Twinkle, the late Kenny Drew Jr., Thomas Carabasi, Eleonora Lvov, Nate Jacobs, Michael Mendez, Kyleelise Holmes, Greg Tate and Bahiyyah Maroon.

Archaeological excavations at the site revealed the existence of underground structures, among them a temple of Mithraism, a mystery religion. The castle was used as a civilian settlement between the 1890s and the 1960s. The site is partly open to tourism. Location Zerzevan Castle was built in the 4th century by the Eastern Roman Empire as a military base on the ancient trade route between Diyarbakƒ±r and Mardin. It was in use until the 7th century. The castle is situated on the top of a -high rocky hill next to Demir√∂l√ßek village about southeast of √áƒ±nar town in Diyarbakƒ±r Province on the highway to Mardin. It is located about from Diyarbakƒ±r. Archaeological works The first archaeological excavations took place in the summer months of 2014. The works were initially carried out by a team of 35 led by an archaeologist from Dicle University, under the supervision of the Diyarbakƒ±r Archaeological Museum. In 2015, the size of the team working at the site increased to 60. It is expected that excavation works will continue for around 30 more years. In 2020, archaeologists found the entrance of the castle.1800-year-old Zerzevan Castle entrance found Castle Aerial view of rock graves in Zerzevan Castle (2016) The castle stretches over an area of . The castle contains structures both above and below ground. Its ruined walls are long and high, and it has a -high watchtower. Inside the castle, there are ruins in a wide area and a rock-necropolis. In the north of the castle, which is at a lower elevation, residences and streets were erected while in the south public buildings were constructed on the higher terrain. A church building facing east-west remains one of the most well-conserved public buildings. Other public buildings include the palace, administrative building, baths, cereal storage, arsenal, and 54 cisterns. Military and medical material, jewelry, ornaments, and bronze coins were also found during the excavations. In 2016, a subterranean church and secret passageways were discovered. The discovered underground secret passageway was not in use for about 3,000 years and the subterranean church was closed around 1,500 years ago. A Mithraic underground temple and a subterranean sanctuary, able to hold 400 people, were also unearthed. The underground temple remnants of the mystery religion attracted more than 20,000 tourists in just one week according to reports by officials. In 2017, four more underground locations were discovered, where further excavation works are necessary to unearth them. The castle was an Eastern Roman military base and a strategic garrison settlement, dominating the entire valley and controlling the ancient road between Amida (now Diyarbakƒ±r) and Dara (now Mardin). The castle played a key role due to its location on the easternmost border protecting the Roman Empire. It marked the intersection and coalescence of the cultures in the west and the east. The place was known as Samachi in classical antiquity. It was the site of heavy fighting between the Byzantine Empire and the Sasanian Empire. Jewelry found in the castle also indicates that the civilian population and military personnel resided together, with soldiers living alongside their family members. It was large enough to sustain a population of around one thousand. Restoration and reconstruction works, which took place during the reigns of Eastern Roman emperors Anastasius I Dicorus (r. 491‚Äì518) and Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565), saw the castle develop into its final state prior to its ruin. The castle was most likely in use until 639 with the arrival of Arab Muslims in the beginning of the Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars. Use as civilian settlement A new settlement was created within the castle once again in the 1890s, when a family moved into the castle. As the population grew to over 30 households, the residents ultimately abandoned the castle in the 1960s, descended to a place about from the castle, and founded a village under the name Zerzevan. This village is called Demir√∂l√ßek today.

He is best known for promoting equal opportunities and campaigning against racism in the medical profession in the 1970s. Early life and family Dipak Ray was born in Cuttack, Orissa, India, around 1930. His family contributed to the Indian independence movement, resulting in Ray's arrest at age 11. He completed his medical training in Calcutta and did some work in the United States before arriving in the United Kingdom during the 1950s. He settled in Blackwood, Caerphilly, South Wales, where he then remained in general practice. He had one son, Indranil, and two grandchildren, Shonali and Mitali. His wife was a teacher and socialist, Rekha. Career By the early 1960s, Ray was a general practitioner (GP) in South Wales. He is best known for promoting equal opportunities and campaigning against racism in the medical profession in the 1970s. He was also a columnist for the magazine Doctor and wrote for Tribune. During the 1970s and 1980s, Ray supported the Medical Practitioners' Union on the British Medical Association's general medical services committee. He was active in public debate, disclosing racism in the medical profession, pushing healthcare motions. endeavouring to end private treatment in NHS hospitals and being involved with the TUC and Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs. He was a commissioner of the Commission for Racial Equality. Ray was amongst the forerunners of patient participation in the organisation of GP surgeries. In 2009, Ray was presented with a Labour party merit award for his involvement in the Labour party. Death and legacy Ray died on 11 February 2012 at the age of 82.

She was awarded the highest medal for humanitarian work, the Florence Nightingale Medal on October 5, 1923. Biography Anka Crvenƒçanin was born in 1850. She was in Belgrade when World War I broke out, and as all three of her sons had joined the army, she went to the Red Cross where she got some stretchers and material to dress wounds. This was the beginning of her selfless effort to help the soldiers fighting in the war. She established battalion field dressing centers, something that had not existed before. This did not escape the attention of Field Marshal Stepa Stepanoviƒá, who commended her on her initiative. Although already middle aged, she worked tirelessly to help the wounded soldiers and organize their transport to places where they might be given medical help. Following the movements of the Serbian army, she worked in the hospitals in Valjevo, Po≈æarevac, Skoplje, and in the fall of 1915, she retreated with the army, through Kosovo and Montenegro, to Lezh√´ in Albania. With her people and her army, the wounded and the sick, she shared good and bad. She was evacuated with civilians and the wounded to France but in 1917 she returned as a volunteer nurse to work in the newly-established hospital of Crown Prince Alexander in Thessaloniki. In 1923, the International Red Cross Committee decided to award ƒêuroviƒá with the greatest honor, the Florence Nightingale Medal. She died in Belgrade in 1925.

It was first described by Sven Koenig and Maxim Likhachev in 2001. Description LPA* is an incremental version of A*, which can adapt to changes in the graph without recalculating the entire graph, by updating the g-values (distance from start) from the previous search during the current search to correct them when necessary. Like A*, LPA* uses a heuristic, which is a lower boundary for the cost of the path from a given node to the goal. A heuristic is admissible if it is guaranteed to be non-negative (zero being admissible) and never greater than the cost of the cheapest path to the goal. =Predecessors and successors= With the exception of the start and goal node, each node has predecessors and successors: * Any node from which an edge leads towards is a predecessor of . * Any node to which an edge leads from is a successor of . In the following description, these two terms refer only to the immediate predecessors and successors, not to predecessors of predecessors or successors of successors. =Start distance estimates= LPA* maintains two estimates of the start distance for each node: * , the previously calculated g-value (start distance) as in A , a lookahead value based on the g-values of the node‚Äôs predecessors (the minimum of all , where is a predecessor of and is the cost of the edge connecting and ) For the start node, the following always holds true: :rhs(start) = g(start) = 0 If equals , then is called locally consistent. If all nodes are locally consistent, then a shortest path can be determined as with A*. However, when edge costs change, local consistency needs to be re-established only for those nodes which are relevant for the route. =Priority queue= When a node becomes locally inconsistent (because the cost of its predecessor or the edge linking it to a predecessor has changed), it is placed in a priority queue for re-evaluation. LPA* uses a two-dimensional key: :k(n) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} k_1(n)\\\\\\\\\\\\ k_2(n)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} min(g(n), rhs(n)) + h(n, goal)\\\\\\\\\\\\ min(g(n), rhs(n))\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} Entries are ordered by (which corresponds directly to the f-values used in A*), then by . =Node expansion= The top node in the queue is expanded as follows: * If the rhs-value of a node equals its g-value, the node is locally consistent and is removed from the queue. * If the rhs-value of a node is less than its g-value (known as a locally overconsistent node), the g-value is changed to match the rhs-value, making the node locally consistent. The node is then removed from the queue. * If the rhs-value of a node is greater than its g-value (known as a locally underconsistent node), the g-value is set to infinity (which makes the node either locally overconsistent or locally consistent). If the node is then locally consistent, it is removed from the queue, else its key is updated. Since changing the g-value of a node may also change the rhs-values of its successors (and thus their local consistence), they are evaluated and their queue membership and key is updated if necessary. Expansion of nodes continues with the next node at the top of the queue until two conditions are met: * The goal is locally consistent, and * The node at the top of the priority queue has a key which is greater than or equal to the key for the goal. =Initial run= The graph is initialized by setting the rhs-value of the start node to 0 and its g-value to infinity. For all other nodes, both the g-value and the rhs-value are assumed to be infinity until assigned otherwise. This initially makes the start node the only locally inconsistent node, and thus the only node in the queue. After that, node expansion begins. The first run of LPA* thus behaves in the same manner as A*, expanding the same nodes in the same order. =Cost changes= When the cost of an edge changes, LPA* examines all nodes affected by the change, i.e. all nodes at which one of the changed edges terminates (if an edge can be traversed in both directions and the change affects both directions, both nodes connected by the edge are examined): * The rhs-values of the nodes are updated. * Nodes which have become locally consistent are removed from the queue. * Nodes which have become locally inconsistent are added to the queue. * Nodes which remain locally inconsistent have their keys updated. After that, node expansion resumes until the end condition has been reached. =Finding the shortest path= Once node expansion has finished (i.e. the exit conditions are met), the shortest path is evaluated. If the cost for the goal equals infinity, there is no finite-cost path from start to goal. Otherwise, the shortest path can be determined by moving backwards: * Start at the goal. * Move to the predecessor of the current node for which is lowest (if the lowest score is shared by multiple nodes, each is a valid solution and any of them can be chosen arbitrarily). * Repeat the previous step until you have reached the start. Pseudocode This code assumes a priority queue \`queue\`, which supports the following operations: * \`topKey()\` returns the (numerically) lowest priority of any node in the queue (or infinity if the queue is empty) * \`pop()\` removes the node with the lowest priority from the queue and returns it * \`insert(node, priority)\` inserts a node with a given priority into the queue * \`remove(node)\` removes a node from the queue * \`contains(node)\` returns true if the queue contains the specified node, false if not void main() { initialize(); while (true) { computeShortestPath(); while (!hasCostChanges()) sleep; for (edge : getChangedEdges()) { edge.setCost(getNewCost(edge)); updateNode(edge.endNode); } } } void initialize() { queue = new PriorityQueue(); for (node : getAllNodes()) { node.g = INFINITY; node.rhs = INFINITY; } start.rhs = 0; queue.insert(start, calculateKey(start)); } / Expands the nodes in the priority queue. */ void computeShortestPath() { while ((queue.getTopKey() < calculateKey(goal))  (goal.rhs != goal.g)) { node = queue.pop(); if (node.g > node.rhs) { node.g = node.rhs; for (successor : node.getSuccessors()) updateNode(successor); } else { node.g = INFINITY; updateNode(node); for (successor : node.getSuccessors()) updateNode(successor); } } } / Recalculates rhs for a node and removes it from the queue. * If the node has become locally inconsistent, it is (re-)inserted into the queue with its new key. */ void updateNode(node) { if (node != start) { node.rhs = INFINITY; for (predecessor: node.getPredecessors()) node.rhs = min(node.rhs, predecessor.g + predecessor.getCostTo(node)); if (queue.contains(node)) queue.remove(node); if (node.g != node.rhs) queue.insert(node, calculateKey(node)); } } int[] calculateKey(node) { return {min(node.g, node.rhs) + node.getHeuristic(goal), min(node.g, node.rhs)}; } Properties Being algorithmically similar to A*, LPA* shares many of its properties. * Each node is expanded (visited) at most twice for each run of LPA*. Locally overconsistent nodes are expanded at most once per LPA* run, thus its initial run (in which every node enters the overconsistent state) has similar performance to A*, which visits each node at most once. * The keys of the nodes expanded for each run are monotonically nondecreasing over time, as is the case with A*. * The more informed (and thus larger) the heuristics are (while still satisfying the admissibility criteria), the fewer nodes need to be expanded. * The priority queue implementation has a significant impact on performance, as in A*. Using a Fibonacci heap can lead to a significant performance increase over less efficient implementations. For an A* implementation which breaks ties between two nodes with equal f-values in favor of the node with the smaller g-value (which is not well-defined in A*), the following statements are also true: * The order in which locally overconsistent nodes are expanded is identical to A*. * Of all locally overconsistent nodes, only those whose cost does not exceed that of the goal need to be expanded, as is the case in A*. LPA* additionally has the following properties: * When edge costs change, LPA* outperforms A* (assuming the latter is run from scratch) as only a fraction of nodes need to be expanded again.

It built on the experiences of the V√©ronique and Vesta programs, and though it was only used for one year, it tested important technologies that were used in later French launch vehicles, from the Topaze and Saphir sounding rockets to the Diamant, the multi-stage orbital rocket that was used to launch France's first satellite, the Asterix-1. Emeraude was launched exclusively from the Centre interarm√©es d'essais d'engins sp√©ciaux (CIEES) launch site in Hammaguir, Algeria. Its codename, VE121, means Vehicle Experimental; 1 stage, liquid propellant (code 2), guided (code 1). The rocket was liquid-fueled and carried 12.8 tonnes of fuel and oxidizer‚Äînitric acid and gasoline turpentine‚Äîwhich were pressure-fed into the four Vexin-B engines, providing a total of 301.55 kN of thrust. Pitch and yaw control were provided by gimbaling the four engines while roll control was provided by aerodynamic fins. The rocket could carry a payload to an altitude of 200 km. Emeraude was considered part of the \\"pierres pr√©cieuses\\" (\\"precious stones\\") rocket family, the family of sounding rockets that led up to the Diamant orbital rocket. The first launches of Emeraude ‚Äì on June 15, June 17, and October 20, 1964 ‚Äì were failures, casting doubt on the entire pierres pr√©cieuses program. These three launches had failed because of propellant sloshing due to pogo oscillation, a problem that was fixed before the fourth launch. However, the final two launches ‚Äì on February 27 and May 13, 1965 ‚Äì went well, with the latter flight reaching an altitude of 180 km. The final test carried a dummy Topaze stage for testing the aerodynamics of Emeraude's successor, the Saphir.

The Gardebataillon is one of the most important military units in the Austrian Armed Forces as its main task is to represent Austria at home and abroad. It is stationed exclusively at Maria Theresien Barracks in Vienna.  History  The Guard in Paris The battalion was formed on March 1, 1935 as the Vienna Guard Battalion. At that time it was based at the Hofburg Imperial Palace. It was dissolved in 1938 following the German Anschluss. In 1956, the unit was restored, initially under the name Heereswachbataillon (\\"Army guard battalion\\"). As military terminology, Wach- and Garde- are almost interchangeable in German language contexts. However, Wach- is more strongly associated with day-to-day security functions, whereas Garde- has additional connotations of ceremonial duties and/or an elite formation, somewhat akin (e.g.) to the British Guards Division. Since that time it has had its headquarters in the Maria Theresa barracks. In 15 May 1957, it reassumed its original name.

Purpose  Its tasks include the protection of federal buildings such as the Hofburg Imperial Palace and the Federal Chancellery. The battalion also provides Guards of Honour to carry out representative duties (such as accreditations of ambassadors, welcoming ceremonies, and parades). Of these, the seniormost task is to provide honours for high ranking high ranking national & foreign dignitaries during events of importance.

Life Biondi was born on Lesina (now Hvar in Croatia) in the Adriatic Sea. Entering the service of the Venetian Republic, he was appointed secretary to Pietro Piruli, the Venetian ambassador in Paris, where he stayed from 1606 to 1608. He became a Protestant convert; and then returned to Venice. At the suggestion of Sir Henry Wotton, the English ambassador, Biondi went to England to seek his fortune. Arriving in 1609, with an introduction to James I, he was at first employed in negotiations with Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy over marriages between his children, and Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales and Princess Elizabeth. It all came to nothing, but the king granted him a pension. In 1615 Biondi went to the Calvinist assembly in Grenoble as James I's representative, assuring them of the English king's protection and favour. From about this period he acted as a double agent, reporting also to the Venetians. On 6 September 1622 he was knighted by James I at Windsor. Soon afterwards he became a gentleman of the king's privy chamber. He had the patronage of William Cavendish, 2nd Earl of Devonshire, who died in 1628. Biondi left England in 1640 for the house of his brother-in-law Mayerne, at Aubonne, near Lausanne, Switzerland. He died there in 1644. He was a member of the Venetian Accademia de' Signori Incogniti. Works Biondi was the author of a trilogy of chivalric romances, which tell a continuous story, and of a work on English history. They were all written in Italian, but became popular in English translation. They are: * L'Eromena divisa in sei libri, published at Venice in 1624, and again in 1628. It was translated into English as Eromena, or Love and Revenge (1631), by James Hayward, and dedicated to Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond. A German translation appeared in parts at Nuremberg between 1656 and 1659, and was republished in 1667. * La Donzella desterrada, published at Venice in 1627 and at Bologna in 1637, and dedicated to the Duke of Savoy. The dedication is dated from London, 4 July 1626, and in it Biondi mentions a former promise to undertake for the duke a translation of The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia. James Hayward translated the book into English, under the title of Donzella desterrada, or the Banish'd Virgin, in 1635. * Il Coralbo; segue la Donzella desterrada (Venice, 1635). It was translated into English by A. G. in 1655, with a dedication to William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford. The translator states that Coralbo was regarded by Biondi as the most perfect of his romances. * L'istoria delle guerre civili d'Inghilterra tra le due case di Lancastre e di Iorc, published in three quarto volumes at Venice between 1637 and 1644, with a dedication to Charles I. It was translated into English, apparently while still in manuscript, by Henry Carey, 2nd Earl of Monmouth, and published in two volumes in London in 1641, under the title of An History of the Civil Warres of England between the two Houses of Lancaster and Yorke. Family Biondi married around 1622 Mary Mayerne, a former lady-in-waiting to Anne of Denmark and the sister of Sir Theodore Mayerne, the king's physician.

The foundation's aim is to maintain and preserve the works of Jasper Cropsey and the art movement he was a part of, the Hudson River School. The foundation also promotes representational painting and sculpture. The organization was founded in 1977 by Barbara and John Newington to collect and promote works of Barbara's great-grandfather Jasper Cropsey, as well as other non-abstract art. The NCF offers free tours of its properties: Ever Rest, the last home and studio of Jasper Cropsey, and the Gallery of Art Building, a museum dedicated to the works of Cropsey. The properties are adjacent to each other in the village of Hastings-on-Hudson. Organization The foundation's stated aim is to preserve the moral, artistic and religious values of Jasper Cropsey and the Hudson River School, as well as to \\"recapture a little sense of stability, security and beauty that was so much a part of the 19th century\\". The foundation also promotes representational painting and sculpture. The foundation does not seek publicity, intending to stay less noticed by the general public. Other than including listings in local guidebooks, the NCF has no marketing. The nonprofit organization is privately owned. The current chairman is Barbara Newington, the executive director is Adelia C. Rasines, and the foundation's director is Anthony Speiser; all three also act as trustees. The organization provides grants to representational artists and classes to sculptors of classical works; it also publishes American Arts Quarterly, a journal for non- abstract art. The NCF maintains a large collection of Cropsey's paintings: about 100 oil and 30 watercolor paintings. It is seen as the leading authority on Cropsey paintings. History =Establishment= After Jasper Cropsey's death in 1900, his wife Maria Cropsey still lived in Ever Rest, until her death in 1906. Jasper Cropsey's granddaughter Isabel subsequently inherited the property and began buying back some of Cropsey's paintings. Isabel and her husband William Steinschneider lived there, raising their daughter Barbara in the house. William was a six-term mayor of Hastings. Isabel died in 1958 and William in 1970, making William the last to live in the house; Barbara inherited it. Their daughter, married as Barbara Newington, aggressively pursued Cropsey's paintings alongside her husband John until about the 1980s, while Cropsey paintings were still inexpensive. Barbara and John Newington created the Newington-Cropsey Foundation and its properties in 1977 with concern over the state of modern art and \\"the way culture was going\\". Newington, today the foundation's chairman, is a philanthropist living in Greenwich, Connecticut and is the great-granddaughter of Cropsey. Around 1977, the foundation traded land with the village of Hastings, giving the village land and $400,000 for a garage for its department of public works. In turn, the NCF acquired a parcel of land and the village's existing public works garage, on a site that was formerly the town dump for decades, and was called Frog Hollow around Cropsey's time. The NCF's initial plans were to renovate the garage, landscape the property, restore the pond, and construct steps to connect the property to Ever Rest, in total \\"to make [the property] look like a Cropsey painting\\". In 1979, the NCF was among several museums and private collectors that lent items to \\"An Unprejudiced Eye\\", an exhibit of Cropsey's works. The exhibit was at the Hudson River Museum and was created by the village of Hastings, marking its association with Cropsey and its 100th anniversary. NCF art historian Kenneth Maddox organized and curated the exhibit. In April 1988, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation cleaned up oil from Sugar Pond, a small pond on the property. The department approved the project and its environmental assessment report. Beginning in the late 1980s, the NCF contracted the construction of an intricately landscaped 19th-century arts complex with three buildings, a pond, and a garden, designed by Peter Gisolfi Associates of Hastings. The first building, the New Studio, opened in 1990 with an exhibition of paintings by Hudson River School artist Worthington Whittredge. The site was also slated to include a gatekeeper's cottage, a library and administration center, an outdoor amphitheater, as well as a museum, which was to be completed in 1992. During the initial planning phase for the complex, the village's historical society intervened, expressing curiosity over possible remains in the ravine. The society urged the village's planning board to put a hold on construction so the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation could make preliminary tests in the ravine. The historical society president described the site as \\"our village's cradle of civilization ‚Äì where our early industry started\\"; another member of the society expressed that the site was \\"the least-disturbed 19th-century industrial site in Westchester County\\". The executive director of the Westchester County Historical Society (a former president of the Hastings Historical Society) supported an archaeological study, and described that the site was previously the confluence of two streams where three early mills operated, including a bone mill and brass and iron-turning factory. Since then, the site was home to the Hastings Pavement and Brick factory, the Cottlet Hotel, and a Hastings Department of Public Works building. The public works building's foundation still remained, and the NCF had planned to build on top of it. The NCF was opposed to archaeological studies as it would require dynamiting the foundation and would disturb the fragile site, including a 125-year-old retaining wall. Greg Wyatt, director of the project, was concerned delays would lead to costs excessive of their $2.7 million budget. The construction was approved pending the archaeological study, paid for by the NCF and directed by a state-approved archaeologist with a specialty in early industry. Barbara Newington was considered a friend of the Hastings Historical Society, and had given the organization its first substantial home. The NCF gave them a $42,000 grant and a 5-year $1 lease to a cottage next to Ever Rest, which the historical society used until its relocation to its current home, the Henry Draper Observatory. The Gallery of Art opened on October 16, 1994. =Garden of Great Ideas= Tree of Learning by Greg Wyatt, in front of Vanderbilt University's Central Library Beginning in May 1997, the foundation partnered with Vanderbilt University to create a sculpture garden on the university campus, to be known as the \\"Garden of Great Ideas\\". Then-US Republican Senator Fred Thompson brought the idea of the sculpture garden to the university's chancellor Joe B. Wyatt, who visited the NCF and decided to partner with the organization. Students of the NCF's Academy of Art, including six young artists, would create the bronze sculptures. The NCF's goal was the placement of many sculptures on numerous college campuses as a link between scholarship and artistry. By 1997, the NCF had already donated Bill of Rights Eagle, a sculpture by NCF Academy of Art Director Greg Wyatt to the college. The NCF planned to donate 15 to 20 additional bronze sculptures by the students for permanent exhibition, added over the following three to five years. The final piece would also be by Wyatt, a sculpture named Tree of Knowledge placed in front of the Jean and Alexander Heard Library. The art program had numerous criticisms. The university's art community and faculty were largely not consulted on the decision. One professor at the school expressed dismay that the \\"program is nowhere near the avant-garde of our own age\\", and that the sculptures were placed in so many areas of the campus that it could impede other gifts or exhibitions on campus. An art professor found the sculptures to not achieve the school's goals of quality and diversity, noting one material, one presentation, and generic ideas symbolized by the works. As well, no Vanderbilt students were among the student artists. Tree of Learning provoked the most opposition from professors, seen as a \\"boring and unchallenging\\" reproduction of a barren or burnt dead tree. Judson Newbern, associate vice chancellor of the college, admitted the tree looks dead, and requested Wyatt weld leaves and buds onto his work. Newbern did defend the program overall, and noted that the student artists are diverse in ethnicity and gender. A committee of professors was not created to approve this project as the vice chancellor did not want the project to be a missed opportunity if obstacles came up. It was noted that the NCF appeared right-leaning, with stated goals to \\"advance and promote the values inherent in the 19th century...including the belief that God created nature\\". The NCF also promotes \\"strong national pride in America\\". Professor Cecilia Tichi was against the works for their values, in believing that campuses are a place to stretch people's minds. =Further history= Sculptor Joseph Petrovics, who sculpted the National Iwo Jima Memorial and the FDNY memorial wall, was a Studio Instructor at the Newington-Cropsey Foundation Academy of Art beginning in 1993. From 1994 until about 2005, the NCF hosted the Hudson Valley Art Association's Annual Exhibition; Newington and the foundation had been long-time supporters of the association, which was established by a small group of artists who first met at Ever Rest in 1928. In 2006, the NCF spent $500,000 to create a Christian docudrama Lost Letters of Faith, a story about King Abgar of Edessa. The foundation filmed the production at Regent University. Terry Lindvall, a film and religious studies scholar and a former president of Regent University, assembled filmmakers for the drama. Another of their film projects, called Cradle of Genius, focused on divine inspiration and the composers Brahms, Puccini, and Richard Strauss. It was based on Arthur Abell's Talks with Great Composers. From 2015 to 2017, Greg Wyatt installed a series of busts at the Boscobel House and Gardens in Garrison, New York. Adjacent to the house, the property contains a permanent sculpture garden with ten bronze busts of significant Hudson River School artists. The sculptures are by Wyatt and were donated by the Newington-Cropsey Foundation. Boscobel was chosen to house the works because of its location in the Hudson Highlands, which was a popular subject of the school's painters, and because the area roughly lies in the geographic center of Hudson River School artist homes and the landscapes that they painted. The busts include a biography of each artist, on the back of each sculpture, and the works also combine elements of the Hudson River School artists' paintings into them. The garden opened with three works in late 2015, and an additional seven were added by November 2017 when the site was dedicated. Ever Rest and the Gallery of Art are part of the Hudson River School Art Trail, a project of the Thomas Cole National Historic Site. Ever Rest Cropsey's home Ever Rest Ever Rest, the cottage and last home of Jasper Cropsey, is a site managed by the foundation. The site is at 49 Washington Avenue in Hastings. The home is open for free tours by appointment as a historic house museum. The bright yellow board-and-batten Carpenter Gothic cottage is on the National Register of Historic Places, and was Cropsey's home from 1885 until his death in 1900. The home houses about 40 to 50 of Cropsey's works, including many watercolors. Gallery of Art The Gallery of Art building is located in a ravine beneath Ever Rest, overlooking the nearby Hudson River and the Palisades and behind a commuter parking lot of the Hastings-on-Hudson Metro-North station. There lies a small campus of buildings, including an archive of Cropsey's papers. The site's administration building houses the office of American Arts Quarterly, a publication for Hudson River Realistic painting, with a circulation of about 3,000. The upper floor has a library with about 4,000 books on 19th century painting, along with a computer library and databanks. The museum is dedicated to the paintings and sculptures of Cropsey and other artists of the 19th century. It holds roughly 75 paintings of Cropsey's, many with scenes from England and Rome, where Cropsey visited, and allegorical works from the 1850s. It is open for free tours by appointment. The yellow Gothic Revival or Palladian style museum building was built in 1994 and designed by Atlanta architects Rodney Mims Cook Jr. and Peter J. Polites of PolitesCook Architects. Along with the surrounding landscape, it was constructed at a cost of about $4 million. The building was designed to resemble a relic from a paste era, recapturing beauty and stability of the 19th century. The building uses many principles of classical architecture, including sunlight directed onto the rotunda's floor. New York Times art critic Roberta Smith found the building to be \\"garishly inappropriate and amateurish\\", with \\"badly scaled architecture\\". She noted that the building's main gallery has Cropsey paintings hung well above eye level, poorly lit, and with unlabeled and overcleaned paintings. She found Cropsey's works better-suited and more easy to see at Ever Rest. =Exterior= The building's exterior has wrought iron doors and a canopy, along with arches and turrets. The parkland surrounding and in front of the gallery includes a duck pond with duck houses. =Interior= The rotunda was modeled after the Pantheon; its terrazzo floor was modeled after the Piazza del Campidoglio in Rome. The rotunda also has friezes of scenes of Hudson River history. Surrounding the rotunda walls is an inscribed quotation from Cropsey: The main gallery is an octagonal Victorian room with maroon-flocked wallpaper above dark oak wainscoting and a timber ceiling, with a large oak staircase to the second floor. The room features Cropsey paintings from its floor to ceiling; the light is kept low, allowing the paintings to glow. It was designed after Hudson River houses including Ever Rest and Lyndhurst. David Linley designed furniture in the building. The building also has commissioned sculptures and religious statues, including a replica of an inscribed lintel, with a message from King Abgar of Edessa to Jesus Christ. The building holds a research library of Hudson River School art and painters, which the organization aims to make the most complete resource for artists of the school within Westchester County. The space also has a gallery for temporary exhibitions by contemporary representational artists.

Description The attack happened at 1:10am, a few hours after the major bombing of the Baltic Exchange seven miles away which killed three people. The bomb was home-made like the Baltic Exchange one, and was placed in a white Bedford van. The IRA gave telephone warnings 50 minutes prior from a phone operator in Portadown, Northern Ireland. Police located the van and evacuated the area. Although no injuries were caused, the blast was powerful and caused significant damage to roads, leaving a crater on the North Circular Road flyover. It was strong enough to be felt several miles away. The bomb damaged a three-storey B&Q; DIY superstore and a steel-framed warehouse, and severely damaged warehouse property constructed of light cladding. It was estimated the explosive force was around 100 kg. An eyewitness said the B&Q; store was \\"completely destroyed\\" and the roof collapsed. Aftermath The B&Q; superstore had to be demolished and the junction was closed for several months, causing severe disruption. It is one of London's busiest intersections as it forms the lead of the M1 motorway. On the morning of 8 October 1993, the IRA targeted Staples Corner once again with a small explosion. Around the same time another bomb detonated 2 miles away on West End Lane in West Hampstead. No injuries were caused. In 1994 two IRA members, Gerard Mackin and Derek Doherty, were found guilty of planting 12 bombs throughout London over seven days in October 1993. In popular culture Staples Corner is featured in Patrick Keiller's 1994 film London. The scene showcases the wreckage of the bombing days after the explosion in 1992.

The 2 kg semtex bomb detonated as he sat near the door of the bus. The bomb killed O'Brien instantly and injured people both inside and outside the bus, including the driver, Bob Newitt, who became permanently deaf. The victims were brought to St Thomas's Hospital and University College Hospital. Three of them were in two cars in front of the bus at the time. The blast could be heard from 5 miles away. Police said they received no warning about the bomb. The incident also forced the closure of Charing Cross railway station. Background The bus bombing came just nine days after the Docklands bombing in east London, which marked the end of the IRA's ceasefire and the resumption of its armed campaign in England.IRA Man: Talking with the Rebels by Douglass McFerran (), page 8 On 16 February, an IRA bomb planted in a telephone box on Charing Cross Road, near Leicester Square tube station, was destroyed by a police remote controlled robot after a telephone warning. Investigation It was initially reported by some media that three people were killed, but it then became clear that only one, the perpetrator, had died. A subsequent police search of the London address of Edward O'Brien, a Provisional IRA member, discovered 15 kg of semtex, 20 timers, 4 detonators and ammunition for a 9 mm Walther revolver, along with an incendiary device. The Walther pistol was discovered on him after his death.Lost Lives, The police said they were also almost certain that O'Brien was the person who planted the telephone box bomb three days before the bus bombing. Another Irishman, Brendan Woolhead, who was in the area at the time of the explosion and suffered a fractured skull, was briefly suspected and accused of involvement. His name was cleared and he subsequently won around ¬£200,000 in damages for libel. Woolhead died in October 1996 due to drug detoxification treatment for addiction to heroin. Bus The destroyed bus was a Leyland Titan double-decker bus - fleet number T990, registration WLT 990, originally registered as A990 SYE in 1984  operated by London Central and travelling its route from Catford to Holborn. The bus had travelled across Waterloo Bridge and just passed Somerset House and the Strand intersection when the explosion happened.

Woodcut from an early modern printing of H√ºrnen Seyfrid. Das Lied vom H√ºrnen Seyfrid (the song of horn-skinned Siegfried), or H√ºrnen Seyfrid for short, is an anonymous Early New High German heroic ballad. The poem concerns the adventures of young Siegfried, hero of the Nibelungenlied. It preserves traditions about Siegfried that are otherwise only known from Old Norse sources and thus attest their existence in oral traditions about Siegfried that circulated outside of the Nibelungenlied in Germany. H√ºrnen Seyfrid tells how Siegfried was raised by a smith, killed a dragon, and made his skin invincible (got his skin as hard as horn (h√ºrnen)). Afterwards it tells how he rescued Kriemhild, daughter of the Burgundian king Gybich, with the help of the dwarf Eugel from a cursed man who has transformed into a dragon. In doing so, Siegfried fights the giant Kuperan. In defeating the dragon, Siegfried acquires the treasure of the Nibelungen and marries Kriemhild. The poem, together with another heroic ballad, the J√ºngeres Hildebrandslied, is the piece of German heroic tradition that remained popular the longest and the only part of the tradition surrounding the Nibelungenlied to enter early print culture. The poem was printed into the eighteenth century, and a prose version continued to be printed into the nineteenth century. Summary Siegfried breaks the smith's anvil in two. Siegfried covers himself with the dragons' melted skin except between his shoulders. The giant Kuperan betrays Siegfried and attacks him. Siegfried fights to save Kriemhild from the dragon. Seyfrid (or Sewfrid), son of king Sigmund, is sent away from his father's court due to his bad behavior. He comes across a smith in a village who takes him as his apprentice, but Seyfrid destroys the anvil with his sword and abuses the other apprentices and the smith himself. The smith therefore sends Seyfrid to a loan linden tree under the pretense that the boy will meet a charcoal burner there. In reality, the smith has sent Seyfrid to the linden tree because a dragon lives next to the tree, and the smith hopes that the dragon will kill the boy. Seyfrid, however, kills the dragon easily and then, looking for the charcoal burner, wanders into a forest where he encounters many dragons in a clearing. Seyfrid rips up trees and throws them at the dragons, trapping them. He finally finds the charcoal burner, and with his help he lights the trees over the dragons on fire, killing them. Their horned-skin (that is, impenetrable skin) melts from the heat and flows as a small stream. Seyfrid sticks his finger into it and realizes that it causes his own skin to harden, so he smears the melted horned-skin over himself, covering everywhere except between his shoulder blades. Later, the poem tells us, Seyfrid will go to the court of King Gybich in Worms, in order to marry Gybich's daughter Kriemhild. He will also find the treasure that Nibelung, king of the dwarfs, had hidden away in a mountain for his sons. Because of this treasure there was a great slaughter among the Huns, which only Dietrich von Bern and Hildebrand survived. In Worms, meanwhile, king Gybich rules with his three sons Gunther, Gyrnot, and Hagen, along with his daughter Kriemhild. One day a dragon appears, seizes the girl and flies away with her to the mountain Trachenstein. The dragon does not mistreat Kriemhild, however, laying his head in her lap. At Easter he transforms into a man. Kriemhild asks him for permission to see her family, promising to return, but he tells her she must remain with her for five years, after which he will sleep with her and take her away with him to hell. The man turns back into a dragon, and Kriemhild prays. Gybich, meanwhile, has sent messengers out to search for his daughter. Seyfrid is out hunting one day when his dogs pick up the scent of the dragon. He follows it, but when he finally sees the dragon he is afraid and wants to run away. But Eugel, king of the dwarfs, now appears and addresses Seyfrid with his own name. Seyfrid, realizing that Eugel knows something about him, asks Eugel for the name of his parents, whom he has forgotten. The dwarf causes him to remember and also tells him about the dragon and Kriemhild. Seyfrid then decides to fight; Eugel tries to dissuade him, but Seyfrid forces the dwarf to help him. Eugel tells him that the giant Kuperan lives nearby, who has the key to the mountain. Kuperan and Seyfrid fight, but Seyfrid wounds the giant, whom he spares in exchange for help freeing Kriemhild. Yet while they are riding through the forest, Kuperan attacks Seyfrid, knocking him unconscious. Eugel covers Seyfrid with his cloak of invisibility to save him until Seyfrid regains consciousness. Seyfrid then attacks Kuperan and wants to kill him, but spares him so that they can enter the mountain. Once they reach the mountain, Kuperan lets Seyfrid in and Seyfrid commands him to leave. Seyfrid finds Kriemhild and wishes to take her away, but Kuperan comes back now, armed with a sword that can cut even dragon skin. Despite receiving grievous wounds, Seyfrid is able to push the giant off of Trachenstein. Eugel now discovers that Seyfrid has eaten nothing for four days and summons his dwarfs to bring him food. Just now the dragon returns, however, and we are told that it was originally a man who was cursed by a woman in a lover's quarl, becoming a dragon and being possessed by the devil. He can only become a man again if he has spent five years with a woman at his side. Seyfrid fights with the dragon, but has to flee the heat of the dragon's fire and together with Kriemhild goes deeper into the mountain. There he finds the treasure of Nibelung, who is Eugel's father. Eugels brothers had hidden it there from the giants. Seyfrid now fights with the dragon once more, killing him and cutting him to pieces which he throws from the mountain. Seyfrid can no longer see or hear and doesn't know where he is, his face is pale and his mouth is black. He falls unconscious. When he wakes up, he discovers that Kriemhild has also fallen unconscious. Eugel gives him an herb, which wakens her. The dwarf then thanks Seyfrid for freeing him from Kuperan and brings him to his kingdom. Seyfrid asks Eugel to tell him his future: the dwarf responds that Seyfrid will be murdered in eight years, but Kriemhild will avenge him. On his way out of the mountain Seyfrid takes the treasure without realizing it belongs to Eugel. As Seyfrid approaches Worms he thinks how little use the treasure will be to him as he will soon die, and dumps it into the Rhine. Seyfrid is well received in Worms and marries Kriemhild, ruling together with Gybich's children, but soon Kriemhild's brothers begin to hate him and later on they kill him at a spring. The ballad ends by stating that anyone who wishes to learn more should read \\"Kriemhild's Wedding\\". Origins, transmission, and dating H√ºrnen Seyfrid and Ermenrichs Tod are the only German heroic poems not found transmitted in any manuscript. It is possible that the poem already existed around 1400, however, as version m of the Nibelungenlied appears to incorporate details from H√ºrnen Seyfrid. The Nibelungenlied n also references details from the poem, as do a version of the Rosengarten zu Worms and of Ortnit. The current form of the poem likely came into being around 1500, possibly in Nuremberg. Twelve printed editions of H√ºrnen Seyfrid are known from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The earliest is from 1530, but is possible that it was not the first. In 1561 the text was reworked stylistically, and this is the version that was found in later printings. Many of the editions feature woodcuts. The poem was rewritten as prose in 1657 with the change of a few names (Kriemhild becomes Florigunda) and with the addition of a few episodes. This version even inspired a sequel in 1660, telling the story of Seyfrid's son with Florigunda, Lowhard. This version continued to be printed into the nineteenth century, though it dramatically changed elements of the poem, particularly concerning \\"Kriemhild's\\" revenge for Siegfried, which mostly falls to Siegmund (in the printing \\"Sieghardus\\"). Relationship to the Nibelungenlied and oral tradition H√ºrnen Seyfrid features numerous details that are known from the Nordic traditions about Sigurd that are absent in the Nibelungenlied. Among these are that Hagen is one of the sons of Gybich, as he is in the Nordic poems Atlakvi√∞a and the Thidrekssaga, that Gybich is the name of the king of Worms rather than Dancrat as in the Nibelungenlied, and that Siegfried is raised by a smith who tries to have him killed by a dragon. This is generally taken to mean that the poet had access to an oral tradition outside of the Nibelungenlied which featured these elements. The poet of the Nibelungenlied, on the other hand, seems to have deliberately suppressed many elements that appear in H√ºrnen Seyfrid, and reports on Siegfried's killing of the dragon and his invincibility only very briefly and in retrospect. Metrical Form H√ºrnen Seyfrid is written in the so-called \\"Hildebrandston\\", a stanzaic metrical form named after its use in the J√ºngeres Hildebrandslied that had an accompanying melody. The stanza consists of four \\"Langzeilen\\", lines consisting of three metrical feet, a caesura, and three additional metrical feet. Unlike the similar stanza used in the Nibelungenlied, in the \\"Hildebrandston\\" all four lines are of the same length. The lines rhyme in couplets, with occasional rhymes across lines at the caesura. In the printed versions of H√ºrnen Seyfrid, these \\"Langzeilen\\" have been split up at the caesura into eight shorter lines. An example is the first stanza of a 1642 printing: :Es sa√ü im Niderlande/ x :Ein K√∂nig so wol bekandt/ a :Mit grosser Macht vnnd Gewalte x :Sigmund ward er genand/ a :Der h√§t mit seiner Frawen/ x :Ein Sohn/ der heist S√§wfried/ b :De√ü Wesen werd jhr h√∂ren/ x :Allhie in diesem Lied. b Aesthetic quality and popular success Scholars frequently decry H√ºrnen Seyfrid's artistic deficiencies: the plot has many inconsistencies and the verse is of low quality. The poem appears to have been haphazzardly put together from various parts. The poem does not problematize any of Siegfried's actions and has a deeply Christian background in which Siegfried represents good and the giants and dragons represent evil. Despite these modern complaints, the poem was very popular and the longest lasting representative of the heroic tradition in Germany. Victor Millet notes that this poem was the first chance many early modern readers had ever gotten to read about the adventures of the famous hero Siegfried, as the Nibelungenlied itself was never printed. Effectively, the more exciting and less intellectually complicated H√ºrnen Seyfrid seems to have replaced the Nibelungenlied. Werner Hoffmann suggests that H√ºrnen Seyfrid's popularity in the Early Modern Period may owe some to its quality as exciting escapist fiction at a time when the Holy Roman Empire was rocked by repeated political instability and religious conflict. The poem's success led to it being translated into other genres: Hans Sachs wrote a tragedy in seven acts in 1557 called Der h√ºrnen Seufrid, which also featured elements from the Rosengarten zu Worms and the printed Heldenbuch. A version of the poem was also contained in a work by the humanist and Lutheran pastor Cyriacus Spangenberg, Der ander Teil des Adelsspiegels (1594), which is cited by Melchior Goldast from a lost printing in 1604. In 1615, the poem was translated into Czech, in 1641 into Dutch. Notes Editions  * Verio Santoro: La ricezione della materia Nibelungica tra Medioevo ed Et√† moderna: Der h√ºrnen Seyfrid.

He was the father of the Victorian era pantomime clowns the Payne Brothers. Life and career Born in the City of London in 1804, W H Payne was apprenticed to Isaac Cowen, a stockbroker; but in his eighteenth year he ran away, and joined a travelling theatrical company in the Warwickshire circuit. He rose to play small parts at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham. Returning to London, he studied under Grimaldi and Bologna at Sadler's Wells Theatre, and then obtained an engagement at an East-end theatre, and in the following year (1825) migrated to the Pavilion Theatre. Here he remained some years, playing small parts, which he raised into importance by the admirable expression of his pantomimic action. At Christmas he represented the character Clown, with Miss Rountree (afterwards his first wife) as Columbine. Payne would wear a partial mask, so contrived that the play of his features could be seen. This was little more than a nose and forehead, and sometimes a separate chin. On 26 December 1831 he made his first appearance at the Covent Garden Theatre in the pantomime Hop o' my Thumb and his Brothers by Charles Farley, in which he played Madoc Mawr, the Welsh ogre, Miss Poole being Little Jack, and Priscilla Horton (afterwards Mrs German Reed) the Genius of the Harp. The next year he was still more successful in the pantomime produced on 26 December of Puss in Boots, in which his character was Tasnar, chief of the Long Heads and No Bodies.The Era 22 December 1878, p. 12Boase, G. C. Payne, William Henry Schofield (1803‚Äì1878)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 28 April 2018 During his long career Payne played many parts, ranging from pantomime to tragedy. He was Harlequin to Joseph Grimaldi's Clown at Sadler's Wells in 1827; he was Dandy Lover to young J. S. Grimaldi's Clown, and made a capital Clown himself. He acted in tragedy with Charles Mayne Young, Charles Kemble and Edmund Kean, and on Kean's last appearance (Covent Garden, 25 March 1833), when playing Othello, and unable to finish the part through illness, it was Payne, then acting Ludovico, who carried him off the stage. He prominently figured in grand ballet with Pauline Leroux, Fanny Cerrito, Carlotta Grisi, Fanny and Therese Elssler and other dancers of note, and played in state before George IV, William IV, Victoria, Napoleon III and the Empress Eug√©nie.'The Last of the Mimes', The Spectator, 28 December 1878, pp. 1633‚Äì4 In 1836 Payne was stage manager at the Pavilion Theatre in Whitechapel,Cast of The Blind Beggar of Bethnal n (1836) - East London Theatre Archive and in 1841 he was back at Covent Garden and filled the r√¥le of Guy, Earl of Warwick, in the pantomime produced at Christmas. On 31 March 1847 he opened at Vauxhall Gardens in a ballet with his wife and his sister, Miss Annie Payne. In 1848 he was engaged by John Knowles for the Theatre Royal, Manchester, and here he remained seven years, increasing the annual run of the pantomime from its usual twenty-four nights to one hundred, and making Robinson Crusoe so attractive that it was represented 125 nights consecutively. On leaving Manchester he appeared with his sons at Sadler's Wells in the pantomime of the Forty Thieves at Christmas 1854. Latterly the Payne family were regularly engaged for Covent Garden, where they became the chief actors and pantomimists in the openings, as well as the contrivers and performers of the harlequinades. They were also frequently seen at the Standard Theatre, the Crystal Palace, and other places. At Christmas 1860 Payne played the title role in Bluebeard; or, Harlequin and Freedom in Her Island Home at the Covent Garden Theatre.Flyer advertising Bluebeard; or, Harlequin and Freedom in Her Island Home - Footlight Notes website Through the whole of his career Payne's private virtues commanded the respect of the profession. In his later years as his powers as a mime faded Payne moved into speaking roles in Victorian burlesque. He died at Calstock House, Dover, on 18 December 1878.

Calu-3 cells are epithelial and can act as respiratory models in preclinical applications. Calu-3 cells were first derived in 1975 by Germain Trempe and Jorgen Fogh of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The cells were isolated from the pleural effusion of a 25-year-old Caucasian male with a lung adenocarcinoma. The ERBB2 gene is overexpressed in Calu-3 cells, and plays a role in aggressive cancer proliferation The Calu-3 cell line grows as an adherent monolayer and overexpresses the ERBB2 gene, leading to active ErbB2/Her2. The cells also express CK7, occludin, and E-cadherin. Calu-3 cells also have large amounts of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Calu-3 cells are commonly used as both in vitro and in vivo models for drug development against lung cancer. The cells have been used in studies of pulmonary drug delivery, demonstrating a capacity to intake low molecular weight substances. Calu-3 cells have served as respiratory models for air intake and lung injury due to their responsiveness to foreign substances. The Calu-3 cell line has shown to be useful in the study of chloride ion secretion by lung epithelial cells. The cells may be used in high-throughput screening applications focused on barrier integrity and surface protein expression of lung cells.

The newly-created First U.S. Congress convened in New York City on March 4, 1789. On April 1, 1789, its members elected Muhlenberg the first Speaker of the House, a position he held until the Second U.S. Congress was sworn in on March 4, 1791. Muhlenberg served four consecutive terms in Congress, and also was elected the third Speaker of the House, a position he held from December 2, 1793 to March 4, 1795. He chose not to run for a fifth term, and retired from Congress on March 4, 1797. Portrait Joseph Wright (1756, Bordentown, New Jersey - 1793, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) was a portrait painter who worked in Philadelphia and New York City. He studied under Benjamin West and John Hoppner in London, and was the first American to graduate from the Royal Academy of Arts. He painted several life portraits of Benjamin Franklin in Paris, and returned to America in 1782 with a glowing recommendation from Franklin.Charles Henry Hart, \\"An Original Portrait of Doctor Franklin Painted by Joseph Wright,\\" The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, vol. 32, no. 3 (July 1908), pp. 321-35.

Muhlenberg commissioned Wright to paint his portrait. It depicts him seated in the Speaker's chair at Federal Hall in New York City, holding a quill pen and in the process of signing House Bill 65, \\"An Act to regulate Trade and Intercourse with the Indian Tribes,\\" which Muhlenberg signed on July 20, 1790.Frederick Augustus Conrad Muhlenberg, from the National Portrait Gallery. Wright is presumed to have painted the portrait in New York City, either toward the end of the First Congress's Second Session (January 4, 1790 - August 12, 1790) or in the recess between the Second and Third Sessions. The Speaker's portrait is the only known life image of Frederick Muhlenberg, and the only known image of the interior of Federal Hall.Monroe H. Fabian, \\"Joseph Wright's Portrait of Frederick Muhlenberg,\\" The Magazine Antiques, vol. 97, no. 2 (February 1970), pp. 256-57. The Speaker's portrait descended through the Muhlenberg family, and was owned by \\"the family of Mrs. George Brooke, of Birdsboro, Pa.\\" in 1910.Henrietta Meier Oakley and J. C. Schwab, The Muhlenberg Album, (New Haven, CT: Tuttle Press, 1910).

Meiser and Gloria Jean Meiser, \\"The Birdsboro Mansion of Edward and Anne Brooke,\\" The Passing Scene, Volume 13, (Reading, PA: Historical Society of Berks County, 2005), pp. 224-39. George Brooke III married a cousin, who was also a descendant of Frederick Muhlenberg. Virginia Muhlenberg Brooke (his widow) lent the Speaker's portrait to the National Portrait Gallery in 1968, for its inaugural exhibition in the Old Patent Office Building.J. Benjamin Townsend, This New Man: A Discourse on Portraits, (Smithsonian Institution Press, 1968), pp. 64-65.

The pendant portrait had remained unpublished since 1910, and scholar Monroe H. Fabian presumed (in 1970) that it had been lost in the 1917 fire. The rediscovery of the Catharine Muhlenberg portrait was announced in 2018. It had survived the 1917 fire, and been passed down to George Brooke III's first cousin, Elizabeth Muhlenberg Brooke Blake, of Dallas, Texas. Blake died at age 100 in 2016, and the portrait was subsequently found in the attic of her Newport, Rhode Island house. Blake's sons have placed the pendant portrait on long-term loan to The Speaker's House Museum in Trappe, the family home of Frederick and Catharine Muhlenberg and their seven children at the time the portraits were painted.

Upon the advice of his teachers, he transferred to the Sculpture Department a year later, as a student of Rudolf Belling, and graduated in 1945. In 1947, he earned a state scholarship by winning the Ministry of Education's exam, and was sent to Paris, France, together with Ne≈üet G√ºnal, Refik Eren and Sadi √ñzi≈ü. In the years 1947‚Äì1950 he studied at the Academie Julian and the √âcole du Louvre in France. His works during his time at the Louvre were especially influenced by Mesopotamian and ancient Egyptian art. The artist, who felt a closeness to the contemporary trends in Paris, opened his first exhibition in this city in 1948. In 1951, a short time before returning to Turkey, he married Melda Kaptana and from this marriage the couple had a son. After returning to his home country, he started his mandatory service at the Istanbul Fine Arts Academy, working there until 1958. In 1952, he won the first place with the Relief composition under the Staircase at the Honor Hall in the \\"Anƒ±tkabir Sculpture Competition\\". Between the years 1952 and 1954, the reliefs he created in the context of this project about the Battle of Sakarya (1921) had traces of the experiences that he had gained in Paris, where he studied Mesopotamian and ancient Egyptian reliefs. He started to work in the metal workshop established in 1953 in the academy with Sadi √ñzi≈ü, Hadi Bara, ≈ûadi √áalƒ±k and Z√ºht√º M√ºridoƒülu. In the same period, with the capital provided by manufacturer Mazhar S√ºleymangil, he set up a metal furniture workshop called \\"Kare Metal\\" with ≈ûadi √áalƒ±k and Sadi √ñzi≈ü, and designed modern furniture. Inspired by the French Groupe Espace in 1955, Ali Hadi Bara, Sadi √ñzi≈ü and architect Tariq Carim founded the group \\"T√ºrk Grup Espas\\". With this group he produced works which advocated the collaboration between painters, sculptors and architects. His work was awarded the second place at the 1954 Ankara State Exhibition, and the first place at the 1955 Ankara State Exhibition. In 1958, he undertook the construction of the Turkish pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair. Upon the invitation of Scottish architect Ralph Erskine, whom he met during the six months they worked on the Brussels project, he went to Sweden to research forms for his architectural designs. Leaving his first wife and his job at the Istanbul Fine Arts Academy, he moved to Sweden in 1959. In 1965 he bought the M/Y Hulda, a two-mast sailing boat built in 1905, which he restored to live and work in. He used this boat as a home and workshop until his death in 1986. Koman's Fr√•n Leonardo (\\"From Leonardo\\") in front of the Stockholm School of Architecture In 1967, he was accepted as a lecturer at the Stockholm School of Applied Arts. Scientific discoveries such as new geometric derivatives and windmills were registered in this period. He won the first prize in the competition for the development of an area in Sweden, Sundsvall, in 1969, and in 1970, the first place in the sculpture contest for a sculpture to be put in front of the √ñrebro Municipal Palace. On December 30, 1986, he died at the age of 65 in Sweden's capital Stockholm. In line with his last will, his body was cremated and the ashes were spread in the Baltic Sea, where he spent a significant time of his life. Koman's sculptures are found in the streets and squares of 20 cities, most of them in Stockholm. In front of the Stockholm School of Architecture, his sculpture Fr√•n Leonardo (\\"From Leonardo da Vinci\\") is one of his widely liked works. Originally located in front of the Yapƒ± Kredi Headquarters in Levent, Istanbul, his sculpture Akdeniz (1980) is the sculptor's most well-known work in Turkey.  Tribute  On 17 June 2019, Koman's 98th birthday, he was honored with a Google Doodle.

Sir Henry Harben (24 August 1823 ‚Äì 2 December 1911) was a British pioneer of industrial life assurance. Family Harben was the eldest son of Henry Harben of Bloomsbury by his wife Sarah, daughter of Benjamin Andrade. He was first cousin to Joseph Chamberlain. The Harben family was originally engaged in banking at Lewes, but Henry's grandfather was a partner in the provision stores of Harben & Larkin of Whitechapel, London, and his father also carried on a wholesale business in the City.  Career  After a few years in his uncle's stores, Harben was articled to a surveyor, but left that calling in March 1852, when he became accountant of the Prudential Mutual Assurance, Investment and Loan Association. The company was founded in a small way at Blackfriars in 1848 and had met with little success. Harben, who remained connected with the undertaking for sixty years, converted it into a colossal concern. In 1854 the company, mainly on Harben's advice, started a scheme of life assurance for the working classes; the new departure was at first hampered chiefly by the rivalry of the Safety Life Assurance Company, of which Cobden and Bright were directors, but which soon collapsed. Harben was appointed secretary of the Prudential on 26 June 1856, and soon proved that industrial life assurance was practicable. He also organised for the first time the valuation of industrial businesses on scientific principles. On 24 February 1870 Harben, who had become in 1864 a fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, was appointed actuary of the Prudential company in addition to the secretaryship. On 23 March 1873 he became resident director and secretary, resigning the latter office in the following year. He was made deputy-chairman on 19 December 1878, chairman on 28 December 1905, and president on 31 July 1907. In May 1879 the business was transferred to Holborn Bars, where the large block of buildings accommodated about 2000 clerks, whilst the company's annual income exceeded ¬£14,600,000 and its funds exceeded ¬£77,000,000. Harben's services and advice were to the last available for the company. He presided at the weekly meeting of the board on 13 July 1911, five months before his death.  Philanthropic, civic and political engagement  Harben was a prominent member of the Carpenters' Company, joining the livery in 1878 and serving as master in 1893. Between 1889 and 1897 he gave large sums to assist the company in their various schemes of technical education and social philanthropy. These benefactions included an endowment for technical lectures and a gold medal in connection with the Institute of Public Health. The Convalescent Home for Working Men at Rustington, Littlehampton, the erection and partial endowment of which cost him over ¬£50,000, was founded in 1895 and opened in 1897. It remained under his own management and that of his son during their lives, and then reverted to the Carpenters' Company, which now contributes liberally to its support. Harben's London house for nearly half a century was at Hampstead, and he keenly interested himself in local affairs. For many years he was a leading member of the Hampstead vestry, and became its chairman. He represented Hampstead on the Metropolitan Board of Works from 1881 to 1889, and from 1889 to 1894 on the London county council. In 1900 he became the first mayor of Hampstead, and was elected for a second year, but resigned owing to failing health. A supporter of the local charities, he built a wing of the Hampstead General Hospital, liberally helped the Mount Vernon Hospital for Consumption and the School for the Blind, and gave 5000l. towards building the Central Public Library. He helped to secure Parliament-hill Fields and Golders Green as open spaces for the public. For the London City Mission he built a hall at Hampstead, and was honorary colonel of the 1st cadet battalion of the royal fusiliers whose headquarters are at Hampstead. His country seat was Warnham Lodge, near Horsham, where he built the Warnham village hall and club; he was a D.L. of Sussex, and served as high sheriff in 1898. An enthusiast for cricket, he constructed one of the best cricket grounds in Sussex, where important matches were played. A conservative in politics, he contested unsuccessfully in 1880 and in 1885. He was knighted on Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee in June 1897.  Death and legacy  Harben died at his Sussex residence on 2 December 1911, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. A portrait by Norman Macbeth was painted in 1872 for the board-room of the Prudential Company. Another presentation portrait, by John Collier (1889), was in the Hampstead Town Hall. A bust from life was modeled in 1902 by James Nesfield Forsyth. Works Harben published: * The Weight Calculator, 1849; 3rd edit. 1879. * Mortality Experience of the Prudential Assurance Company, 1867-70, 1871. * The Discount Guide, Tables for the use of Merchants, Manufacturers ‚Ä¶ ; new edit. 1876. Family Harben married (1) on 1 August 1846 Ann (d. 1883), daughter of James Such, by whom he had issue a son, Henry Andrade Harben, his successor as chairman of the Prudential (1849-1910), whose death in August 1910 was a severe blow; and (2) on 8 November 1890 Mary Jane, daughter of Thomas Bullman Cole. He was survived by a daughter and two grandsons, Henry Devenish Harben and Guy P. Harben the artist.

Along with the Royal Exchange it provided one of the major shopping centres in London, particularly after the Fire of London. Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany visited the premises during his visit to England in 1669 and described the building: :\\"The building has a facade of stone, built after the Gothic style, which has lost its colour from age and become blackish. It contains two long and double galleries, one above the other, in which are distributed in several rows great numbers of very rich shops of drapers and mercers filled with goods of every kind, and with manufactures of the most beautiful description.

Documentation  Applying international political pressure on the Marcos administration, three Amnesty International missions were able to speak to political prisoners and release mission reports containing detailed descriptions of specific torture cases. The reports, released in 1974,1974 Part 1 https://www.amnesty.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/pol100011973eng.pdf1974 Part 2 https://www.amnesty.org.ph/wp- content/uploads/2014/11/pol100011975eng.pdf 1975, and 1981https://www.amnesty.org.ph/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/asa350251982en.pdf respectivelyhttps://www.amnesty.org.ph/contact-us/ml_reports/ have since become a major source of historical documentation regarding torture under Ferdinand Marcos' regime. Accounts were also gathered by Task Force Detainees of the Philippines, the World Council of Churches, the International Commission of Jurists, and other non-government organizations.  Historical Background  Ferdinand Marcos was nearing the end of his last constitutionally allowed term when he declared martial law in 1972. First elected president in 1965, he was already the first president to be elected to a second term. Marcos had won the 1969 campaign on the strength of a USD50 Million spending spree on infrastructure designed to court voters, which forced him to take on a loan with the IMF whose requirements so destabilized the Philippine economy that the resulting inflation led to protests and general unrest from 1970 to 1972. Marcos blamed this unrest on the newly- formed Communist Party of the Philippines under Jose Maria Sison, despite both Philippine and American intelligence services noting that the communist situation in the Philippines was \\"normal\\" or at the lowest level of concern; and on a supposed \\"Islamic Insurgency\\",although the armed Moro National Liberation Front would not form until after Marcos' declaration. For Marcos to continue to act as head of state, his declaration of Martial Law had to achieve seven objectives: 1\\\\. Control the military and police; 2\\\\. Control the Supreme Court; 3\\\\. Undermine the Philippine public's faith in democracy; 4\\\\. Exploit and abet lawlessness and instability; 5\\\\. Exaggerate the Communist threat; 6\\\\. Get political backing from the United States; and 7\\\\. Hijack the constitutional convention. In support of these goals, Ferdinand Marcos' declaration of martial law in late September 1972 gave military officers \\"extraordinary powers\\" over the life and death of civilians without accountability,\\" and branded opponents as either communists or communists sympathizers whether or not it happened to be true.  Perpetrators  The 1976 Amnesty International Mission Report lists 88 government torturers by their initials, with ranks as junior as Sargeant and as high as Brigadier General. The units of the various perpetrators responsible for this torture were under the command of Juan Ponce Enrile in the case of the Philippine Army, and of Fabian Ver and Fidel Ramos in the case of the Philippine Constabulary (then still a part of the Military, rather than the civilian unit it is today). However, the reports of Amnesty International, Task Force Detainees of the Philippines, the World Council of Churches, etc, all assert the fact that the torture happened as a policy of state, meant to stifle opposition, demonstrate the power of the ruling regime, and terrify the population into inaction. In their 1984 report on \\"Torture in the 80s\\", Amnesty International expounds: > \\"Torture does not occur simply because individual torturers are sadistic, > even if testimonies verify that they often are. Torture is usually part of > the state-controlled machinery to suppress dissent. it is most often used as > an integral part of a government's security strategy. Concentrated in the > torturer's electrode or syringe is the power and responsibility of the > state.\\" Journalist Raissa Robles later noted that although Amnesty International made President Marcos aware of the names of these perpetrators, only one of them was ever brought to court, and even he was not convicted; and that most of these individuals were eventually promoted despite Marcos' regular press announcements that supposed military torturers had been caught and tried.  Specific methods Various forms of torture were used by forces under the Marcos regime, usually combined with each other. =Physical torture= Physical torture was also often inflicted upon victims. Aside from deadly weapons, implements of torture included water, pliers, thumb tacks, ballpoint pens, and flat irons. Physical torture took the forms of: * beatings. Almost all who were tortured were subjected to beatings. Victims include Roland Simbulan, Julius Giron, Macario Tiu, Eugenio Magpantay, Joseph Gatus, Rev. Cesar Taguba, Reynaldo Guillermo, Alejandro Arellano, Charley Palma, Victor Quinto, Pedro de Guzman Jr., Reynaldo Rodriguez, Ma.

Shaw (1880 ‚Äì June 15, 1962) was noted as the person who held the record of gambling on horse races at Hollywood Park race track in California. She was called \\"America's No. 1 racing fan.\\" Except for brief periods of illness, Mrs. Shaw did not miss a day's racing from the park's opening on June 10, 1938, nor did she fail to bet on a single race. When the grandstand burned down in 1949 and the management moved the track's operation to Santa Anita that year, she took an apartment close by to continue her attendance. For most of this time, she was the co-owner of the Inglewood Daily News. It was calculated that she had wagered on 16,032 horses in placing 5,344 win-place- show bets through June 19, 1953 (668 days of racing). By the time she died on June 15, 1962, she had bet on 9,769 races. When she could not attend because of illness, she sent her wagers with a friend. \\"I've come here when I could hardly walk, and I've come fresh out of hospitals. Climbing 500 steps a day to place bets keeps me young,\\" she said about the Hollywood Park grandstand. Mrs. Shaw said she did not play hunches, but wagered on past performance. In one instance, she could not make up her mind and bet on two horses to win, and they finished in a dead heat. Her favorite jockeys were Willie Steed, Joe Phillippi, Johnny Longden and Willie Shoemaker. Her favorite horses were Seabiscuit, Sickle Bill and Malicious. She began carrying one of Seabiscuit's racing plates to the turf club at the track, where regular patrons rubbed their tickets on it for good luck. An original shareholder in the Hollywood Park organization, Mrs. Shaw celebrated all her birthdays at the track except when it was closed during World War II.

This empowers users to make safer choices: to avoid more dangerous substances, to use smaller quantities, and to avoid dangerous combinations. Drug checking services have developed over the last twenty-five years in twenty countries and are being considered in more countries, although attempts to implement them in some countries have been hindered by local laws. Drug checking initially focused on MDMA users in electronic dance music events but the services have broadened as drug use has become more complex. These developments have been strongly affected by local laws and culture, resulting in a diverse range of services, both for mobile services that attend events and festivals and fixed sites in town centres and entertainment districts. For instance, staff may or may not be able to handle illegal substances, which limits the use of testing techniques to those where the staff are not legally in possession of those substances. People intending to take drugs provide a small sample to the testing service (often less than a single dose). Test results may be provided immediately, after a short waiting period, or later. Drug checking services use this time to discuss health risks and safe behaviour with the service users. The services also provide public health information about drug use, new psychoactive substances and trends at a national level.  History  The earliest reported drug checking activity began in Amsterdam in November 1970 with a group from the University Hospital of Amsterdam and samples obtained through psychiatrists working with people who used drugs. The earliest reported drug checking service is the Drug Information and Monitoring System (DIMS) in the Netherlands supported by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport. Since 1992 the service has tested over 100,000 drug samples at a national network of twenty-three testing facilities. Service users receive results within a week via phone or email and the service publishes aggregated results describing what substances are in use. European countries have led the introduction of drug checking services, with Asociaci√≥n Hegoak Elkartea founded in Spain in 1994, TechnoPlus in France founded in 1995, and Modus Fiesta in Belgium in 1996. DanceSafe have operated in the USA since 1998 providing reagent testing and harm reduction advice. More recent services include The Loop founded in the UK in 2013 and KnowYourStuffNZ in New Zealand in 2015, with Pill Testing Australia launching after a successful trial in 2018. On March 31st 2017 a coalition of drug safety organisations hosted the first-ever International Drug Checking Day to raise awareness of safer drug use. The initiative was aimed at recreational users, with a particular emphasis on the nightlife community, and aims to promote harm reduction‚Äîaccepting that people will choose to take drugs, and providing them with tools to minimise the risks.  Approaches to drug checking  = Front- of-house testing = Front-of-house testing provides testing services to clients at events. It provides real-time, as-you-wait results. An example is the testing at BOOM festival in Portugal where drug testers are legally allowed to handle samples. Where testers are not allowed to handle samples, for fear of breaking laws around possession, clients themselves must handle the substance to be tested. Examples of this model are KnowYourStuffNZ in New Zealand. = Back-of-house testing = Back-of-house testing is more restrictive. The substances tested do not come directly from event participants. Instead, they may come from samples confiscated by Police or event security or samples that are disposed of into drug amnesty bins. The results may not be available to event attendees. = Middle-of-house testing = Middle-of-house testing is a new development, started by The Loop in the UK. Testing happens on-site but without face-to-face interaction with the public - samples from medical incidents are tested and alerts can be issued after multiple incidents with a trend are identified. = Testing outside events = Static testing sites provide testing services to clients at fixed locations away from events. Often these are in the entertainment districts of cities. Energy Control in Barcelona and DIMS in the Netherlands provide such services. Off-site testing occurs away from events and away from clients. Clients submit samples by post or at drop-off locations. Those samples are analysed and then the results are publicised. Examples of this model include WEDINOS (the Welsh Emerging Drugs & Identification of Novel Substances Project) and DIMS in the Netherlands. The UK's first trial of community-based drug safety testing was carried out in Bristol and Durham in 2018 in a church, a drugs service, and a youth and community centre. Users reported that they intended to carry out a range of harm reduction actions such as alerting friends and acquaintances, being more careful mixing substances, consuming lowered dosage, and disposing of substances.  Analysis technologies  A range of analysis techniques are in use by drug checking services. The most common are reagent testing, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, raman spectroscopy, and gas chromatography mass spectroscopy. Developing technologies include nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and ion-trap mass spectroscopy. Reagent testing uses chemical indicators that show a colour change in the presence of particular drugs. These tests are widely available and affordable. The use of several reagents is generally necessary to positively identify a substance with Marquis, Mandelin, and Mecke reagents being used to detect MDMA and Ehrlich's reagent common for detecting LSD. However, reagent testing only indicates the presence of a substance, not the absence of contaminants or other substances. This can provide a false sense of security when illicit drugs are deliberately adulterated to fool reagent tests. The presence of specific drugs can also be detected through immunoassay testing strips. Testing strips for fentanyl can detect a few tens of nanograms of the substance at a price of a few dollars per test. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is a rapid test using robust hardware that can be carried out in the field. It provides sample identification and mixture analysis, allowing the detection of impurities and adulterants. It is highly sensitive and can carry out analysis using only a few milligrams of a sample. It is semi-quantitative and can provide an indication of purity. For these reasons, it is widely used by both fixed and mobile testing services and considered the best technology to use. Gas chromatography mass spectroscopy provides very sensitive and quantified information about substances. However, the high price and delicate equipment generally limit the use of this technique to fixed sites.  Effectiveness of drug checking  Drug checking has been shown to be an effective way to reduce the harm from drug use through informing safer use, limiting use, and helping users avoid the most dangerous substances. The services also provide monitoring and detection of new psychoactive substances to inform public health interventions. The Loop have stated that 20% of samples are handed in for disposal and 40% of service users reduce intake. KnowYourStuffNZ have found that, when substances are not as expected, half of service users state they will not take that substance and a quarter say they will take a smaller quantity. Drug checking services also reach drug users who are not reached by existing services. Evidence from research conducted by Austrian pill testing service CheckIt! found 58% of people who use the service would not otherwise seek out harm reduction information, and about 75% are more likely to access harm reduction services if pill testing is included. Academic research from the UK has found that one in five substances were not what they were expected to be and two-thirds of misrepresented samples were disposed of. Such on-site testing accesses otherwise hard-to-reach user groups to reduce the harms associated with drug use. In a peer-reviewed study published in Journal of Psychopharmacology, researchers at Johns Hopkins found that people were about half as likely (relative risk = 0.56) to report intent to use a product if testing did not identify the substance as MDMA, and this was a statistically significant reduction.

It is located at a distance of circa 80 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 5084 is at least 200,000 light years across. It is one of the largest and most massive galaxies in the Virgo Supercluster. It was discovered by William Herschel on March 10, 1785. The galaxy is seen nearly edge-on, with inclination 86¬∞, and features a warped disk and large quantities of HI gas extending along the disk, probably accumulated after multiple accretions of smaller galaxies.  Mass and size estimates  NGC 5084 is a very massive system, with a high rotational speed of about 328 km/s. It is categorised as a supermassive disk galaxy. Gottesen (1986) estimated based on the rotational speed that the mass of NGC 5084 is 8.5 x1011 and its radius to be 34 kpc (110 kly) for an estimated distance of 15.5 Mpc (50 Mly). Gottesman et al. (2002) using the same method adopted as distance the 30 Mpc and calculated the mass of NGC 5084 to be 1.7 x 1012 . Koribalski et al. (2004) measured the rotational speed of NGC 5084 to be 334 km/s and calculated its mass to be 1.3 √ó 1012 and its radius was estimated at 50 kpc (163 Kly). Carrignan et al. (1997) measured the velocity differences and projected separations of nine galaxies they identified as satellites of NGC 5084 and using different equations they estimated the mass of NGC 5084 to be between 6 x 1012 and 1 x 1013 , which was at that time the highest mass ever derived for a disk galaxy. They estimated the optical diameter of NGC 5084 to be 74 kpc (241 Kly).  Nearby galaxies  NGC 5084 is the largest galaxy in the NGC 5084 group, which also includes NGC 5087 and NGC 5134 and some smaller galaxies. The galaxy group is compact, showing little redshift dispersion. NGC 5068 is a foreground galaxy. Other nearby galaxy groups include the NGC 5078 group, which includes NGC 5078, NGC 5061, and NGC 5101, and NGC 4965 group. NGC 5084 is located at end of Virgo II groups, a filament of galaxy groups that extents southwards from the Virgo cluster.

Professional career Oluokun did not receive an invitation to the NFL Scouting Combine. On March 8, 2018, Oluokun participated at a Pro Day held at Yale and completed all of the combine drills. Oluokun‚Äôs time of 4.48 in the 40-yard dash would‚Äôve finished sixth among all linebackers at the combine and his time of 4.12 in the short shuttle would‚Äôve been the second best time of all linebackers. Oluokun attended pre-draft visits with multiple teams, including the Kansas City Chiefs, Arizona Cardinals, and Indianapolis Colts. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Oluokun was projected to be a seventh round pick by the majority of NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked as the 20th best linebacker in the draft by DraftScout.com. The Atlanta Falcons selected Oluokun in the sixth round (200th overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft. Oluokun was the 27th linebacker drafted in 2018. Oluokun became the first Yale player to be selected in the NFL Draft since Shane Bannon in 2011. He also became only the 44th player to be drafted from Yale since 1936.

Oluokun entered training camp slated as a backup linebacker and special teams player. He had immediate success after impressing coaches with his athleticism and tackling ability during camp and began competing against Duke Riley to be the starting weakside linebacker. Head coach Dan Quinn named Oluokun a backup middle linebacker, behind Deion Jones, to begin the regular season. He made his professional regular season debut in the Atlanta Falcons' season-opener at the Philadelphia Eagles and made one tackle during their 18‚Äì12 loss.

Ltd. and located in the Suir Valley at the village of Ardfinnan, County Tipperary, Ireland. Founded in 1869, it manufactured woollen and worsted cloth, specialising in tweed and suitings for the tailoring trade. It briefly produced a unique weatherproof cloth, while later in its history turning to off-the-peg suits it became noted as the only firm in the Republic of Ireland completing all processes of clothing manufacture. A leading industry in Irish textiles, it closed in 1973 with the loss of over 100 employees.  History  = Early history = Oldest surviving building viewed from Ardfinnan bridge. In 1867 J. Mulcahy from County Cork, who had knowledge in the wool trade, proposed to establish a woollen mill on the River Suir at Ardfinnan with the help of his investing friend J. Redmond. On the site of a former gristmill which had been in existence since before the early 17th century, it was built in 1869 adjoining the historic river crossing point at Ardfinnan bridge, underneath Ardfinnan Castle.Journal of The Waterford & South-East of Ireland Archaeological Society, Volume VII, Harvey & Co. 1901 The under-flowing Suir powered wool spinning machinery in an exceptionally tall four-story building via a water turbine and was utilized for the washing and dying processes of the locally sheared wool, produced by sheep in the surrounding Galtee and Knockmealdown mountains. Other cloth manufacturing stages were performed in separate buildings, while the process of 'tentering' was performed at the banks of the Suir on the village green. The mill office was located within the only surviving section of the gristmill that had formerly occupied the site and which provided access to the mill from Barrack Street via its adjoining gate. Using a New Jersey built water turbine from T.C. Alcott & Son, it was among only two such industries in Munster to employ a water turbine as a source of power, those being Ashgrove Woollen Mills and Kerry Woollen Mills.Industrial Ireland 1750-1930: An Archaeology, Colin Rynne, Collins Press, 2006 Ardfinnan blankets and tweed gained a reputation for fine quality and variety. In 1881 the main four-story mill building burnt down along with Mr. Mulcahy's adjoining dwelling at Mill House. Production was rectified by 1882 with the completion of smaller replacement two-storey buildings.Exeter Times Employment numbers were reduced to approximately 100. Rows of cottages were built by the company to house its workforce, of which had a large influence on the growth of the village and later Ardfinnan GAA as the men often played football on the green opposite the mill after a days work. Electricity generated by the mill's water turbine was later provided to a total of 14 homes in Ardfinnan and all of its electric street lights until the ESB introduced the Rural Electrification Scheme which took over the supply in January 1953. Mulcahy, Redmond & Co. was selected to represent the Irish Woollen Industry along with 12 other firms at the Cork International Exhibition of 1902. HM King Edward VII was present at this exhibition and it was when he was en route to Lismore Castle in Waterford that he stopped at Mulcahy, Redmond & Co. out of genial curiosity. = Galtee Motor Cloth = Mulcahy-Redmond as seen in the 1880s - Note the presence of the adjoining office building and gate (right) demolished in the 1980sIn 1906 the firm patented the Galtee Motor Cloth, an innovative cloth combining warmth with a waterproof-breathable functionality. Named after the Galtee Mountains and evoking the inclement Irish weather, it was claimed to be \\"the warmest cloth ever made for motoring coats\\". It was a layered cloth of Irish frieze and merino wool woven with mohair from the Angora goat. It would be slightly porous when dry, therefore crucially breathable and thus hygienic. However, when the outer surface became wet, the pores of the cloth closed due to its contraction and subsequently became rainproof.Health's Highway, R.J. Mecredy, Yellon, Williams & Co. Ltd., 1909 Royal patronage was received in late 1906 when HM King Edward VII commissioned the firm to make their Galtee Motor Cloth with his bespoke specifications. After being tailored into a fine coat on Saville Row (possibly at Henry Poole & Co), he expressed his delight for the quality of the versatile garment which he comfortably used on his motor drives. Irish motoring pioneer Richard J. Mecredy, remarked in 1908, \\"We have used one of these coats for several years, and find it perfect from every point of view\\", highlighting that it truly was waterproof not only after continuous use, but also when exposed to a water hose.The Encyclopaedia of Motoring, R.J. Mecredy, Mecredy Percy & Co. 1908 In Great Britain and Ireland, the Galtee Motor Cloth became popular for bespoke tailored car coats. Ready- made coats were first supplied by Pim Bros. For inclement weather conditions on the road, these woollen coats were superior in their multi-purpose functionality to either fur coats, rubber Mackintosh or cotton gabardine Burberry raincoats. High market demand was brief however, as the introduction of car windshields made weatherproof motoring coats obsolete. Galtee Cloth can be seen as the predecessor to the cotton Grenfell Cloth, created in 1923 for similar, yet harsher weather conditions. =1914 - 1960s= Ardfinnan Woollen Mills in the early 1970s The British War Office made large contracts with Mulcahy-Redmond during the First World War to produce khaki serge for military uniforms.In a Time of War: Tipperary 1914-1918, John Dennehy, Merrion, 2013 Despite large success, some war contracts were turned down due to the still relatively small size of the mill. The 6th Marquess of Waterford, Lord Henry Beresford had overhauled his successful woollen mill at Kilmacthomas with first-rate machinery in 1910, only to soon die in 1911 and after which the family mill was sold to Stevenson Brothers of Staffordshire, England, who closed the mill and transferred its machinery to Ardfinnan Woollen Mills in the 1920s. Under the direction of W.J Mulcahy (in place of his deceased brother and father), this resulted in a large expanse of Mulcahy-Redmond on to the opposite side of Barrack Street and hugely increased productivity. Ardfinnan cloths were used by principle tailors in London, Paris and New York. Demand from the Irish market soared with the Anglo-Irish Trade War following the policy of protectionism. It was termed a 'Free State Woollen Mill' and cloth was often commissioned for √âamon de Valera, as seen during his travels to the League of Nations. Following the Second World War and then in its third generation of Mulcahy directorship, the firm established a Men's & Boy's ready-made clothing department employing over 70 female workers, making Mulcahy-Redmond & Co. the only firm within the Republic of Ireland that was completing all stages of clothing manufacture from raw wool to a wearable garment. During this period the firm employed a recorded 220 workers. The construction of garment manufacturing facilities was followed by the erection of a larger office space located on the opposite side of Barrack Street. The 1960s saw international prestige increase for the firm. In both 1961 and 1962, Ardfinnan thornproof tweeds won the Premier London Award and Georgian Silver Cup at international level in London. At the 1965 Leipzig Trade Fair in Germany, a gold medal was awarded for the firms boucl√© tweed. The decade also saw contracts signed for cloth for Macy's Herald Square department store in New York to use in their made-to-measure clothing. However, the firms ready- made clothing ranges struggled to compete with cheaper Asian imports. Ardfinnan Knitting Wool and knitting patterns were exported primarily to the UK and remained profitable along with their tweed suitings. =Closure= With up to 500 people dependent on the mill, over 100 workers were left unemployed when the firm closed in early January 1973 due to a competitive disadvantage with the onslaught of cheaper imports, largely taking its toll with Ireland's admission to the EEC. The firm had ran into financial debt of over ¬£200,000. Its closure resulted in a large protest in the nearby town of Clonmel as promises by the Fianna Fail government to sustain the mill through financial aid of ¬£250,000 were not followed through. Youghal Carpets was the only Irish industry to receive such financial aid. Trade showrooms were located on Dublin's South William Street. The company's former Dublin offices were at Ardfinnan House, 17 Trinity Street, Dublin 2. The steel plate name Ardfinnan House remains on the building. Their United Kingdom branch was at Londonderry House, Chichester Street, Belfast.

Overview Forms of autonomous peripherals in microcontrollers were first introduced around 2005. Allowing embedded peripherals to work independently of the CPU and even interact with each other in certain pre-configurable ways off-loads event-driven communication into the peripherals to help improve the real-time performance due to lower latency and allows for potentially higher data throughput due to the added parallelism. Since 2009, the scheme has been improved in newer implementations to continue functioning in sleep modes as well, thereby allowing the CPU to remain dormant for longer periods of time in order to save energy. This is partially driven by the IoT market. Conceptually, autonomous peripheral operation can be seen as a generalization of and mixture between direct memory access (DMA) and hardware interrupts. Peripherals that issue event signals are called event generators or producers whereas target peripherals are called event users or consumers. In some implementations, peripherals can be configured to pre- process the incoming data and perform various peripheral-specific functions like comparing, windowing, filtering or averaging in hardware without having to pass the data through the CPU for processing. Implementations Known implementations include: * Intelligent autonomous peripherals (Capture/compare unit CCU6) in Infineon XC800 series of 8051-compatible 8-bit microcontrollers since 2005 * Event System (EVSYS) in Atmel AVR XMEGA 8-bit microcontrollers since 2008 * Peripheral Event System (PES) with SleepWalking in Atmel (now Microchip Technology) AVR32 AT32UC3L 32-bit microcontrollers since 2009 * Peripheral Reflex System (PRS) in Energy Micro (now Silicon Labs) Gecko EFM32 32-bit ARM-based microcontrollers since 2009 * IXYS/Zilog ZNEO Z16FMC 16-bit microcontrollers since 2011 * Event Link Controller (ELC) in Renesas microcontrollers since 2011 * Programmable Peripheral Interconnect (PPI) in Nordic nRF 32-bit ARM-based microcontrollers since about 2011 * Autonomous peripherals in Infineon XMC 32-bit microcontrollers since 2012 * Data Transfer Manager (DTM) in Silicon Labs Precision32 SiM3L1 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 microcontrollers since 2012 * Peripheral Event System (PES) with SleepWalking in Atmel (now Microchip Technology) SAM4L 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 microcontrollers since 2012 * Power-Smart Peripherals in Freescale (now NXP) Kinetis L 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontrollers since 2012 * Event System (EVSYS) with SleepWalking in Atmel (now Microchip Technology) SAMD, SAML and SAMC 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontrollers since 2013 * Core Independent Peripherals (CIP) in Microchip PIC16F and PIC18F as well as Microchip AVR ATtiny 8-bit microcontrollers since 2015 * Peripherals Interconnect Matrix in STMicroelectronics' STM32 32-bit ARM-based microcontrollers since 2015 See also * Channel I/O * Peripheral DMA controller (PDC) * Clock gating, autonomous peripheral clock gating * Power gating * CPU power dissipation * Low-power electronics * Event-driven architecture * Event-driven programming References Category:Central processing unit Category:Electric power Category:Electronics and the environment Category:Electronics optimization ","title":"Autonomous peripheral operation"},{"id":"57266827","text":"Korey Cunningham (born May 17, 1995) is an American football offensive tackle for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL).

Their primary home was a trailer that includes luxury features such as a California king-size bed, granite kitchen countertops, a TV, and a separate room for their two dogs. They initially bought the $48,000 trailer for offseason travel, but soon decided to live full-time in it. In a 2020 ESPN story, Bozeman estimated that the move saved the couple about $1,800 per month in rent.

The Polish White Book is a semi-official name of a series of comprehensive reports published during World War II by the Ministry of Information of the Polish government-in-exile in London, England, dealing with Polish-German relations before and after the 1939 German-Soviet aggression against Poland. Each publication, released in English, French, German and Polish between 1940 and 1941, consisted of official documents and affidavits, supplemented with an overview by the Ministry. Notably, the Polish White Book was released in parallel with The Black Book of Poland series by G.P. Putnam's Sons of New York, published in London by Hutchinson & Co under a differing title in 1942. Publishing history The first volume of the White Book publication series, released in the spring of 1940, was titled Official Documents Concerning Polish-German and Polish-Soviet Relations 1933‚Äì1939 ‚Äì Polish White Book. The book described and documented the Polish-German negotiations in the lead-up to World War II. The second volume of the White Book ‚Äì sometimes considered to be the first volume of The Black Book of Poland ‚Äì was titled German Invasion of Poland (L'Invasion Allemande en Pologne, Paris: Flammarion, 1940). The third volume of The Polish White Book was titled German Occupation of Poland. Extract of Note Addressed to The Allied and Neutral Powers. It is a 240-page report, published in 1941 during World War II by the Ministry of Information of the Polish government-in-exile, describing atrocities committed by Germany in occupied Poland. It contains 180 appendixes with lists, names, dates, and the circumstances of Nazi brutality toward Polish civilians, including men, women and children. Most of the book consists of appendixes, documenting the locations of Nazi ghettos where thousands of Jews perished, and the shift in extermination methods from shooting to poisoning by gas. The affidavits confirm Heinrich Himmler‚Äôs personal involvement in the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto and the final transports to death camps. The Polish White Book was written as a plea for help to the world community. At the time of its compilation, there were two million Polish Jews still alive in occupied Poland, hoping for an international rescue effort. Contents As the reports of Nazi war crimes in occupied Poland increased dramatically, new volumes of The Polish White Book series were released.

The White Books by the Polish Ministry were released over the course of two years. The original Polish White Book, along with its subsequent volumes were published in both Paris by Flammarion and in London by Hutchinson & Co.[p.13 of 253 in PDF] The final White Book, titled German Occupation of Poland. Extract of Note Addressed to the Allied and Neutral Powers was released by Greystone Press of New York in 1941. The book contained a 55-page overview, signed by Auguste Zaleski in London on May 3, 1941, and 180 appendices with evidence of forced expulsions and deportations of Jews to overcrowded ghettos, where starvation and disease were commonplace, along with evidence of deliberate destruction of the Polish nationhood, in a total of 243 printed pages. The White Book was followed by The Black Book of Poland printed by G.P. Putnam's Sons of New York in 1942. It was a collection of authenticated documents, depositions, eye-witness accounts, and Ministerial summaries, describing and illustrating with photographs, the Nazi crimes against the Polish nation and War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II, committed in a mere two years, including massacres, tortures, expulsions, forced colonization, persecution, destruction of culture, and humiliation of a nation. = German Occupation of Poland (1941).

Bertha inherited property in the Schluchsee region. She possessed three (of the seven) secular benefices of the monastery of Marchtal.Historia monasterii Marchtelanensis, III.5, p. 665 ; Hlawitschka, Untersuchungen, pp. 55f.

Population In 1699 Iberville said that the Bayagoula and Mougoulacha together had about 180-250 warriors and an estimated 1,250 people. Language The Mougoulacha language was closely related to Choctaw and Chickasaw, which are both Muskogean languages. Early History In the year 1699 Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville journeyed to the east of the Mississippi River Delta and encountered the Mougoulacha tribe. d'Iberville was amazed that the Mougoulacha chief was wearing a blue serge coat. The chief said that the coat was given to him many years ago when Henri de Tonti explored the area. The Mougoulacha chief then showed d'Iberville a letter that was written in french. d'Ibberville determined that the letter was left by Tonti with the Quinipissa tribe fourteen years earlier. This led d'Iberville to believe that the Mougoulacha were actually the remaining members of the Quinipissa tribe. Culture The name Mougoulacha (Imongolosha) is believed to mean \\"People from the other side\\". The tribe maintained perpetual fires burning in two village temples. The temples were the same size as their homes but decorated with animal carvings. The explorer d'Iberville said that he saw many carvings of possums which they called choucouacha in their native language along with offerings of deer, bear, and bison skins inside the temple. A Jesuit priest named Paul du Ru said that the Mougoulacha had two temples in each village located on opposite sides of a large plaza. Some sources indicate that the Mougoulacha may have been the same tribe as the Quinipissa, Acolapissa and the Tangipahoa. According to several sources related to the Houma, many tribes in the area of Lake Ponchartrain were called Mougoulacha.

As the girls work with Nariyuki to achieve their academic goals, they must also deal with their growing feelings for him. As the story progresses, two other girls are focused upon: Mafuyu Kirisu, their teacher who despite her professionalism, is a slob at home and Asumi Kominami, a r≈çnin who has the appearance of a middle schooler despite her age. Near the end of the story, at the Ichinose School Festival, rumor has it that couples who dance together at the bonfire are destined to become a couple. During this event, Nariyuki encounters one of the girls, but her identity is obscured upon the chapter's first release. The story has five separate endings with Nariyuki ending up with one of the five girls. While their endings vary, the focused girl is the one who Nariyuki encountered at the bonfire. Characters ; : :A third-year student and the main protagonist. In order to provide for his poor family, Nariyuki seeks to obtain his school's special VIP nomination, a scholarship which waives all future university tuition fees. He receives the nomination, but is given the arduous task of getting three fellow classmates into their universities of choice. His focus on studies was inspired by his late father, who died shortly after he entered junior high school. While book smart, he is extremely oblivious to the romantic interest the other girls develop for him over the course of the series. ; : :A third- year student and a genius in the fields of arts and literature. Fumino is fascinated with stars and wishes to pursue a degree in astronomy, despite her mediocre mathematics skills. Ironically, her father is a university mathematics professor. Fumino and her father have had a strained relationship ever since her mother's death ten years prior. However, with Nariyuki's support, they are finally able to reconcile. She often finds herself as the go-between for Nariyuki and the other girls regarding romance advice. She eventually falls for him herself, but tries to suppress her feelings for the sake of her friends. In her ending, she is the one who falls on the way to the college entrance exam rather than Nariyuki. Using her broken leg as a means to grow closer to him, she and Nariyuki struggle to confess their mutual feelings for each other, but the two eventually do and become a couple. ; : :A third- year student and a genius in the fields of mathematics and science. Rizu finds difficulty in understanding emotions, which inspired her decision to pursue a degree in psychology to overcome her own weakness. She is also passionate about board and card games, an interest fueled by gifts she had received from her late grandmother. She has never won a single game, blaming her endless losing streak on her inability to read people. Her family runs an udon shop, which she occasionally helps run. In her ending, she and Nariyuki help their friend Sawako Sekijou reconcile with her estranged parents, after which they become a couple. ; : :A third-year student and a swimming prodigy. Uruka dreams of becoming an Olympic athlete and seeks to earn an athletic scholarship. However, due to her poor academics, she is placed under Nariyuki's tutelage to help improve her English skills and become a more well- rounded student. She has had a crush on Nariyuki since middle school, and befriended him after helping him cope with his father's death. Nevertheless, she continuously struggles to confess her feelings towards him. Later in the series, she receives a scholarship opportunity from an Australian university and becomes a famous swimmer. In her ending, it is revealed that she is the one who helped Nariyuki emotionally recover from the loss of his father. She confesses her feelings to Nariyuki before she leaves for Australia. Several years later she returns, now a world champion swimmer, and Nariyuki proposes to her, which she accepts. ; : :A teacher at Ichinose Academy, and Rizu and Fumino's first tutor. Her opinions on education are very strong, and feels it is a waste of ability to not pursue a path that takes advantage of one's natural talents. She later had a change of heart after seeing Nariyuki help her students progress and apologizes to them for her selfishness. She was formerly an aspiring figure skater who retired from the sport after being inspired to pursue a career in teaching by Nariyuki's father. While Mafuyu comes off as cold and callous, she cares deeply about her students and wants them to succeed. Despite her professional demeanor while on the job, she is a complete slob at home. ; : :An alumna of Ichinose Academy and a r≈çnin student. Asumi is often mistaken for a middle school student due to her petite stature. She aspires to attend the national medical university, despite her lackluster grades in science, in order to support her father's medical clinic. She first meets Nariyuki during cram school, and enjoys teasing him flirtatiously, much to his embarrassment. To pay for her cram school lessons and medical school entrance exam fee, she works at a maid caf√© called High Stage. In her ending, which takes place several years later, Asumi is on track to becoming a doctor and is doing her residency on a small, remote island with her parents supervising it. Nariyuki happens to land a job on the same island as a teacher and is also her next door neighbor. After a series of events involving Nariyuki and his students, things take a turn for the worst when Nariyuki badly injures himself rescuing two children during a massive storm. Requiring surgery, Asumi is forced to operate on him as her father cannot perform the complex task. The incident solidifies her feelings for Nariyuki and after his full recovery, he proposes to her.

Eleven maps of various neighborhoods are also included. The supplement was re-issued as a boxed set re-titled Haven: The Free City in 1984.

In the June-July 1982 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #31), Lew Pulsipher noted that although there was a lot of material included, \\"there are few maps of individual buildings, and many buildings are unaccounted for, not surprising in a city this size.\\" Pulsipher believed this was a supplement that would appeal to players interested in role-playing rather than combat, saying, \\"The place is designed for hard-core role-players, fans of improvisational theatre who enjoy a long chat with an NPC as much as they enjoy a fight\\", and he warned that for that reason, \\"the referee should be experienced and patient.\\" Pulsipher gave the supplement an above average rating of 9 out of 10. In the March-April 1985 edition of Space Gamer (No. 73), Rick Swan reviewed the 1984 boxed set, and commented that \\"It's an excellent design, and the enthusiasm the designers brought to the project is evident throughout. If the characters occasionally lapse into stereotypes and if the scenarios occasionally seem overly familiar . . . given the size and scope of Haven, such flaws are easy to forgive.\\" Reviews *Different Worlds #20 (March, 1982) References Category:Fantasy role-playing game supplements Category:Thieves' Guild ","title":"The Free City of Haven"},{"id":"57267616","title":"Olga Katryna Subeldia Cabrera"},{"id":"57267625","text":"Kendrick Norton Jr. (born June 7, 1997) is a former American football defensive tackle.

Clitz was taken to the McGehee House, a prominent battlefield landmark, where his Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War colleague, Confederate Major General D. H. Hill called for a surgeon to dress his old friend's wounds.Burton, Brian K. Extraordinary Circumstances: The Seven Days Battles. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001. . p. 121. Clitz was appointed brevet lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army to rank from June 27, 1862, for gallant and meritorious conduct at the Battle of Gaines's Mill, Virginia. Clitz was held as a prisoner of war in Libby Prison, at Richmond, Virginia, from June 28, 1862 to July 17, 1862, when he was paroled for exchange.As noted in the article about D. H. Hill, on July 22, 1862, Major General D. H. Hill and Union Army Major General John A. Dix concluded an agreement for the general exchange of prisoners between the Union and Confederate armies, known as the Dix-Hill Cartel. See Dix's report to Union Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, July 23, 1862, Official Records, Series II, vol. 4, pp. 265‚Äì68. The agreement established a scale of equivalents, where an officer would be exchanged for a fixed number of enlisted men. It also allowed for the parole of prisoners, who would undertake not to serve in a military capacity until officially exchanged.  Commandant of Cadets at West Point and garrison duty  Clitz served at the US Military Academy, as Commandant of Cadets and Instructor of Artillery, Infantry, and Cavalry Tactics, from October 23, 1862, to July 4, 1864.

Clitz then served as a member of Tactics Board from June 25, 1866, to February 4, 1867. To cope with the increase in firepower of artillery, repeating rifles and Gatling guns, the Tactics Board recommended that the US Army adopt the more modern tactics described by Union Army Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Emory Upton in his 1867 work, published in 1872: A New System of Infantry Tactics, Double and Single Rank, Adapted to American Topography and Improved Fire-Arms.Upton, Emory. A New System of Infantry Tactics, Double and Single Rank, Adapted to American Topography and Improved Fire-Arms. New York, D. Appleton. 1872. . Upton stressed light column formations instead of the close order formations that led to many casualties at battles such as the Battle of Cold Harbor in 1864. Commanding General William T. Sherman supported these recommendations but they failed to gain adherence from many older officers and the US Army bureaucracy.Jamieson, Perry D. Crossing the Deadly Ground: United States Army Tactics, 1865‚Äì1899. Tuscaloosa, AL: University of Alabama Press, 2004. . pp 6‚Äì13.
