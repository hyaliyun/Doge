History  It was discovered in 1876 by a German archaeological mission. The Lion of Babylon is over 2600 years old. The statue was built by the Chaldean Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II (605-562 BC). The statue had been damaged over the years due to lack of protection, getting climbed on by tourists that left marks on the statue, or natural causes like erosion which Archaeologists had already feared was going to happen without the right protection of the statue. In 2013 The World Monuments Fund worked with the Iraq State Board of Antiquities to make improvements to the site. The Lion was cleaned and partially restored, the base of the statue was replaced, and a security barrier was added.  Description  The statue is made out of black basalt black stone; it depicts a Mesopotamian lion standing above a laying human. The statue is two meters in length and the platform upon which it stands is one meter. The lion weighs about 7000kgs. The statue height is 11.95 meters, and it is 2.6 meters long.  Symbolism  The Lion of Babylon is a historic theme in the region. The statue is considered among the most important symbols of Babylon in particular and Mesopotamian art in general. The statue is considered a national symbol of Iraq, it has been used by several Iraqi institutions such as the Iraqi Football Association. The lion was meant to put fear into their enemies, by showing a lion trampling a man to scare their enemies. It represented Ishtar, the goddess of fertility, love, and war. On the back of the lion is a representation of where Ishtar should stand.

Biography Born on 5 July 1905 in Port-au- Prince, she was the daughter of the poet and diplomat Georges Sylvain and his wife Eugénie Mallebranche. A brilliant student, she was educated in Haiti, Puerto Rico and the United States, graduating in law at the University of Haiti in 1933, studying education and sociology at the University of Puerto- Rico (1936–38) and at Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania, where she earned a doctorate in sociology in 1941. Her thesis Haïti et ses femmes. Une étude d’évolution culturelle (Haiti and its Women. A Study of Cultural Evolution) was published in 1957. Her academic career began in 1941 when she taught at Haiti's Ethnology Institute, continuing in 1945 at the National Agricultural School and at Fisk University. She was an Honorary Member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority. With a view to improving social and economic conditions for women, together with several other women from the upper and middle classes, she established the Ligue Féminine d'Action Sociale (Feminine League for Social Action). Sylvain-Bouchereau played an important part in contributing to La Voix des Femmes, the organization's journal. International participation Sylvain-Bouchereau's international career began in 1937 when she was the Haitian delegate at the Third Inter-American Conference on Education. She was an early participant in the work of the United Nations, arranging social services for Polish political prisoners in 1944. She sat on the first committee for women's rights and, from 1952 to 1956, assisted the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom in giving educational courses in Copenhagen and Hamburg.

He’s now the elder statesman singer, the doyen of his bracket and as great a radio personality, as ever…Bing is an exponent of the ‘sing’ but his talk is true, an incredible combination that he's made all his own, over the years, whether on an hour's kick or on tit-bits of this or that.\\" However, Broadcasting Magazine was not happy with the 'talk' aspect of the show. \\"...But the chatter part of the program is a sad let-down. Instead of the carefree, casual banter which Bing and Ken used to exchange so amusingly, the opening programs of this season's Crosby series found Bing stumbling through inept monologues... Finally, this Crosby series is being broadcast sustaining (and how could one better epitomize the plight of network radio than by the single sorry fact that the whole high-powered CBS sales staff was unable to find a sponsor for a man whose products are still top sellers in record shops and movie houses?)... Estimated production cost: $2,700 per 15-minute program.\\" The show ran until December 31st 1956 without a break. Sponsorship was intermittent with Lanolin Plus Liquid, New Coffee Flavour Instant Postum and Philip Morris advertising in some shows. Initially Crosby used \\"Moonlight Becomes You\\" as his theme tune before switching to \\"Something In Common\\". The audience rating was 3.1 for 1954-55 which earned the programme fourteenth position in the Nielsen ratings.

This function, with its argument shifted down by 1, interpolates the factorial and extends it to real and complex numbers in a different way than Euler's gamma function.

In his day, he was considered an outstanding interpreter of William Shakespeare's Hamlet, playing the role several times in the 1920s. Early life Milton was born in San Francisco on 10 January 1890. Career Milton joined the Old Vic in 1918. He later acted with the Royal Shakespeare Company from 1962. Unlike many of his peers, he made very few feature film appearances. A notable supporting role was Robespierre in the 1934 Leslie Howard comedy drama The Scarlet Pimpernel. He voiced the White Rabbit in the 1949 film version of Alice in Wonderland. He also had supporting roles in The Foreman Went to France (1942) and Cat Girl (1957). He was a pioneer in Shakespeare on BBC television. His first appearance was in 1937 as Richard, Duke of Gloucester in the 'wooing scene' from Richard III and he took the title role in the 1938 live production of Julius Caesar set in Fascist Italy. This was the first full-length production of a Shakespeare play on television. Later he repeated on television his stage role in Luigi Pirandello's Henry IV .

Revenues are typically generated by providing deal-specific advice related to mergers and acquisitions and financing. The WSJ noted in January 2016 that \\"boutique is a fuzzy label, defined as much by what these firms do (mostly give M&A; advice) as what they don’t do (trading, lending, much in the way of underwriting).\\"  History  = 1800s: Early history = Rothschild was founded in the City of London in 1811. The largest independent firm, Lazard, got its start in 1848 and only went public in 2005 under the leadership of Bruce Wasserstein, who unified its disparate branches. = 1980s: New players established = In September 2015 the FT wrote, \\"The concept of an advisory boutique dates back to the 1980s, when some of Wall Street’s biggest names ditched established banks to set up their own firms — often after legendary bust-ups. Peter Peterson and Stephen Schwarzman quit Lehman Brothers after an epic power struggle to start the Blackstone Group in 1985. Blackstone started out as an M&A; advisory firm before branching out into private equity investing, a formula that made both men billionaires. A few years later, Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella left First Boston and created Wasserstein Perella. In 2006 Perella co-founded Perella Weinberg Partners, with Peter Weinberg, then of Goldman Sachs.\\" = 1990s: Conglomerate model ascendent = The repeal of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act that kept investment banks and commercial banks separate led to significant consolidation. The FT wrote that in the 1990s, \\"the 'financial supermarket' model was ascendant.\\" Sandy Weill rolled up various commercial banks, investment banks, brokerages and insurance companies to form Citigroup. J.P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan agreed to combine and Credit Suisse swallowed Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 2000. = 2000s: Resurgence and wave of new firms = Evercore Partners was founded in 1996 by Roger Altman and has a broader investment banking business than most independent firms, including equity research and underwriting services. Greenhill was also founded in 1996. Greenhill listed its shares in 2004, Lazard in 2005, Evercore in 2006, and Moelis in 2014. Ex-UBS banker Blair Effron founded Centerview Partners in 2006 because of the difference between smaller and larger firms, where he worked most of his career. He told the FT in September 2015, “Dillon Read where I started was about providing intellectual capital. UBS [which acquired Dillon Read in 1995] was a provider of financial capital.” Following the financial crisis of 2007-08, there was a heightened sense of conflict of interest around the bulge bracket wall street banks. Dealogic recorded that the market share of U.S. boutiques hit 18% in the first half of 2015, up from 8% in 2008, with independent firms participating in six of the top 10 M&A; deals. In March 2012 the FT wrote, \\"a long-term and fundamental trend is coming back to the fore: the perennial fight between smaller boutique advisers and their bulge-bracket rivals has picked up pace.\\" In 2013, 80% of the top 10 M&A; deals included independent advisors. In March 2013 Fortune wrote of the purported competitive advantages independent advisory firms face. The WSJ noted in April 2014 that \\"investors and clients are drawn to nimbler firms with less-complicated business models and fewer regulatory barriers ... Sprawling financial malls such as Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan hawk a menu of products: deal advice, lending, derivatives and so on. Boutiques purport to sell only the smarts and experience of their bankers. As a result, they claim that their counsel is unsullied by other interests.\\" However, many have diversified into other areas such as asset management. PJT Partners was founded in the summer of 2014 and merged with Blackstone's corporate finance and private funds business, floating on the NYSE in late 2015. In March 2015 the Financial Post wrote, \\"in a coup that grabbed headlines ... Centerview Partners and another U.S. independent advisory firm, Lazard, shut out the majors in the year’s biggest deal [until that point]: the US$75 billion merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz\\". Hugh McGee of Barclays (formerly Lehman Brothers), who earned a $13m bonus in 2013, told the FT in September 2015 that “between regulatory compliance and internal bureaucracy I found myself spending 80 per cent of my time on non-client activities, which is really not fun”.

It took place on 25 May 1799 between Austrian and French troops. The battle ended in the evening with the retreat of the Austrians, but on the following day the French withdrew.  Background  General Friedrich von Hotze The Swiss Old Confederacy was occupied by the French Empire in 1798 and the French-supported Helvetic Republic was established on its territory. Thus, at the beginning of the War of the Second Coalition, French troops under General André Masséna (1758–1817) were operating on Swiss soil. After defeats in the Battle of Feldkirch und der Battle of Stockach, the French had to pull back and abandon eastern Switzerland. Two Austrian armies under General Friedrich von Hotze (1739–1799) and Archduke Charles (1771–1847) pursued them. They sought to unite these two armies as quickly as possible. On 22 May 1799, the vanguard of the Archduke's army reached Frauenfeld, where they stopped in order to meet up with the vanguard of General Hotze's army, which occurred on 24 May. After the advance troops of the Austrians had already linked up, General Massena who was stationed at Winterthur decided to make an attempt to prevent the enemy's main forces from linking together. At this point he posted four French and two Helvetian Battalions, a company of Helvetian sharpshooters, five squadrons of Hussars and eight cannons under General Charles Nicolas Oudinot (1767–1847) and General (1754–1799) to meet the enemy at Frauenfeld. General Nicolas Soult (1769–1851) followed in reserve with three more French and three Helvetian battalions.  Battle  Death of General Weber On the morning of 25 May 1799, around 5 o'clock, General Oudinot encountered the weak Austrian garrison at Frauenfeld. These troops slowly withdrew over the Thur. Around 9 o'clock however more troops from Hotze's army arrived (six battalions and six squadrons) under General Petrasch of Wyl, on the left flank and in the rear of the French. The French were forced to bring their main force up against this new enemy. About 22,000 Austrians were now arrayed against about 14,000 French and Swiss troops.Johann Georg Heinzmann: Kleine Schweizer Chronik, Part 2, Bern (1801), p. 637 This clash continued without a clear victor until evening. As a result, there were very heavy losses. The Adjutant General of the Helvetian troops himself, General Johann Weber (1752–1799) fell victim to a sharpshooter. Since the outcome of the battle was so unclear, General Petrasch decided to retreat at 7 o'clock in the evening. The Austrians lost about 2,000 men in the battle (mostly captured) and two cannons.Carl von Clausewitz: Die Feldzüge von 1796 und 1799 in Italien und in der Schweiz, Leipzig 1999, p. 435 During the battle, two further columns of Massena's army attacked the Austrian archduke's main forces near Rorbas and Andelfingen in order to push them back over the Thur. After some initial success, however, the French were themselves pushed back. Despite the tactical success at Frauenfeld, Massena's position thus remained untenable and he led a withdrawal in the direction of Zurich on 26 May. Contemporaries, like Carl von Clausewitz, criticised Massena for having three columns (and the reserve under Soult) operate separately from one another instead of concentrating his whole force against Hotze's army. Only in this way, they said, could he have defeated the Austrians.In this sense: Carl von Clausewitz: Die Feldzüge von 1796 und 1799 in Italien und in der Schweiz, Leipzig 1999, pp. 432–435  Aftermath  Because of the failure of the French attack on the Archduke's army and the subsequent French retreat, there was no further obstacle to the union of the two Austrian armies. After further defeats, the French army scored a victory at the end of September in the Second Battle of Zurich. After this, the French regained the city of Frauenfeld and other territory.

As a two-year-old in 1996 he was one of the best staying colts of his generation in Britain, winning three of his five races including the Racing Post Trophy on his final appearance of the year. He sustained an injury in winning the Trophy and never recovered his form, finishing unplaced in his two subsequent starts. He later stood as a breeding stallion in France, South Africa and Ireland and had some success as a sire of National Hunt horses. He died in Ireland in 2011 at the age of 17. Background Medaaly was a grey horse standing 1.65 metres high, bred in England by his owner Sheikh Mohammed. He was sired by Highest Honor, a French stallion whose most important victory came in the 1987 Prix d'Ispahan. He later became a very successful sire of winners, with the best of his progeny including California Memory, Sagacity (Critérium de Saint-Cloud), Reve d'Oscar (Prix Saint-Alary), Marotta (Prix Saint-Alary) and Dedication (Prix de la Forêt). Medaaly's dam Dance of Leaves was an unraced mare who produced several other winners including the Queen Anne Stakes winner Charnwood Forest. She was a daughter of the influential broodmare Fall Aspen, whose other descendants have included Timber Country, Dubai Millennium and Elnadim. Medaaly raced in the colours of Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation and was trained throughout his racing career by Saeed bin Suroor. Racing career =1996: two-year-old season= Medaaly began his racing career in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse on 6 July in which he was ridden by Mick Kinane. Starting at odds of 3/1 he took the lead in the last quarter mile but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten three quarters of a length into second place by the filly Gretel. At the end of the month he was partnered by Darryll Holland when he started odds-on favourite for a similar event at Doncaster Racecourse. After tracking the leaders in the early stages he went to the front three furlongs from the finish and won by two and a half lengths from Further Outlook. John Reid took the ride when Medaaly was moved up in distance for a minor stakes over one mile at Sandown on 30 August. Starting the 4/9 favourite he raced in second before taking the lead two furlongs out and won \\"comfortably\\" by three and a half lengths from the Henry Cecil-trained Imperial President. On 29 September Medaaly was moved up in class and started 3/1 second favourite for the Group Two Royal Lodge Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. Ridden by Frankie Dettori he was restrained in the early stages and never looked likely to win, finishing fifth behind Benny the Dip, Desert Story, Besiege and Equal Rights. Four weeks later he faced Benny the Dip and Besiege again in the Group One Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster and started a 14/1 outsider in a nine-runner field which also included his better-fancied stablemate Asas. With many of the leading jockeys engaged in the Breeders' Cup at Woodbine Racetrack in Canada he was partnered by Gary Hind, a relatively little-known jockey who had ridden for the Godolphin stable in Dubai. Hind settled the colt behind the leaders as the outsider Daylight in Dubai set the pace from Besiege. Medaaly moved up to challenge the leaders approaching the final furlong, took the lead in the closing stages and won by half a length from Poteen with Benny the Dip a length and a quarter away in third place. The win gave Gary Hind his first and only Group One success in Europe. After the race he commented \\"I was a bit worried early, because Medaaly wasn't really travelling. But in the straight he came back on the bridle and used his experience to battle back past the other horse. When he was beaten last time the wrong tactics were used, and the team was quietly confident\\". After the race Medaaly was found to have sustained a serious leg injury described as a \\"chip in his knee\\". =1997 & 1998: three- and four-year-old seasons= After spending the winter recuperating in Dubai, Medaaly returned to England in the spring of 1997 and made his seasonal debut in the Dante Stakes (a major trial for The Derby) over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse on 14 May. Ridden by Dettori he chased the leaders in the early stages but faded quickly in the straight and finished eighth of the nine runners behind Benny the Dip. The colt then had further training problems and missed the rest of the season. Medaaly remained in training as a four-year-old but made only one appearance when he contested the first round of the Maktoum Challenge at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse on 22 January 1998. Racing on dirt for the first time he finished fifth behind Wathik, beaten more than twelve lengths. Stud record After his retirement from racing Medaaly stood as a breeding stallion at the Haras du Logis in Normandy. He was exported to South Africa in 2004 and moved back to Europe in 2008 to stand in Ireland. The best of his flat performers included Daly Daly (Grand Prix de Vichy) and the Listed race winners Tocopila and Rento. His offspring did better under National Hunt rules and included Medermit (Scilly Isles Novices' Chase, Haldon Gold Cup), Sky's the Limit (Coral Cup) and Shekira (Prix Renaud du Vivier). In March 2011 he suffered a cardiac arrest after covering a mare at the Badger Hill Stud in County Galway and died at the age of 17.

History The club's clubhouse at Grange Park. Wetherby RUFC take on Old Otlensians RUFC in 2007 The first rugby union was played in the town in 1934. Initially the club played on the Ings (close to the site of the current rugby league club). The club folded in 1939 following the outbreak of war; it reformed in 1966. The club initially played at Lime Kiln Lane at Kirk Deighton using the Bay Horse as clubhouse. In 1970 the club tried to arrange a new ground at Grange Park (a former manor house that had been demolished in 1966 with the cricket club already playing there); this didn't come to fruition as the landowner died and the land was sold. In 1971 the club moved to Losh Pot Lane (also in Kirk Deighton). In 1981 a youth side was formed. The issue of upgrading the A1 came about again with another bypass being proposed; this would stand on land occupied by Grange Park. The site was cleared in 1986 beginning with the ceremonial burning of the cricket clubs 1920s pavilion and the cricket pitch moved eastwards. The lands new owner David Hudson opened up negotiations with the rugby club and in 1989 a new clubhouse shared with the cricket club was opened.

He had three brothers: Kazimiersz, Stanislaw and Josef and three sisters: Hedwig, Regina and Hanna. His maternal grandparents actively took part in the January Uprising (1863); both of them were deported to Siberia, never to return. His grandfather's brother Jan, also an insurgent, fled with raftmen to Gdańsk and then on to the United States. A need for education/training, self-development, work and mutual assistance reigned within the family. Early life and education In 1928 he graduated from the Tadeusz Kościuszko High School in Łomża. He actively took part in the scouts. Even at this stage his organizational skills were obvious. In later years, he repeatedly stressed the importance of scouting in the education of the young. For a few years in high school he fenced with a passion. He began his studies at the University of Warsaw in the Faculty of Law, after passing the first year, he moved to the Faculty of Medicine. thumb In 1935, he graduated from the Faculty of Medicine at Warsaw University. During his studies he attended lectures with such as professors: Mściwój Semerau-Siemianowski, Witold Orłowski, Adam Czyżewicz, Tadeusz Butkiewicz, Henryk Gromadzki, Dr. Roman Welman. During his studies he had to support himself, working as a lab technician with Professor Serkowski. He took an active part in student life. As the first head of construction of the Medical Student's Accommodation (Domu Medyka) on Oczki in Warsaw, he and a group of friends organized balls and film screenings in order to raise funds for the construction. He worked in the cardiology department with Professor (then Assistant Professor) Mściwoj Semerau-Siemianowskiego. Career After graduating in 1935 - 1936 he completed his military service at the Cadet's school sanitary division in Warsaw. After completing military exercises he was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant, sanitary division, allocated to the officer resources of the district hospital in Warsaw. In 1936 - 1937 he worked at the Saint Sophie Gynecological - Obstetrics unit. From 1937 he associated himself with the hospital of the Transfiguration. In September 1939 he was drafted into the army, allocated to the Army Poznan as the Head of the chemical – bacteriological field hospital No. 202. Near Kutno, the sanitary train in which the hospital was housed, was bombed. September 18, 1939 during the battle of the Bzura River, in Sennik, Dr. I. Roszkowski was wounded and taken prisoner. On October 15, 1939, thanks to the help of his uncle Wacław Roszkowski and friend, Jerzy Niżałowski, he managed to escape from the POW camp and returned to Warsaw. After returning to Warsaw, he returned to the Hospital of the Transfiguration, living and working there throughout the entire occupation. During the years 1937 - 1942 in the obstetrics - gynaecology wards, then from 1942 - 1944 in the surgery wards under Doctor T. Budkiewicz. Throughout those years the surgery wards were equivalent to accident and emergency. For a young doctor these were years of hard work, with continuous extra operations in addition to the scheduled ones, carried out in secret, with great risk to life as extensive gunshot wound operations (each gunshot wound had to be reported to the German authorities). Ireneusz Roszkowski was part of the team of surgeons operating on wounded soldiers from the Resistance, amongst whom, were those injured in the assassination attempt on the head of the Gestapo, Kutschera. Sometimes, a few times a week, he was called upon at night, to assist at difficult births. He never refused to help needy patients, the injured or the birthing woman. From 1944 - 1945 he was one of the initiators and organizers of the teaching of medical students on Boremlow, which at the end of the war evolved into the structure of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Warsaw. It was very important to him to re-launch the work of the University as quickly as possible. Many young people in the resistance worked in hospitals, but did not know what to do, as they were completely lost in the new reality. After the war, they were threatened from repressions by the security services. Learning at the higher education institution was an opportunity for them to survive and at the same time, the possibility to acquire an education. During the years 1944 - 1946 he worked in the Obstetrics / Gynaecology clinic in Warsaw with Professor Adam Czyżewicz, after that, 1946 - 1951 he moved to Gdańsk as the professor's assistant and then Assistant Professor at the Obstetrics / Gynaecology clinic of the Medical Academy with Professor Henry Gromadzki. His PhD thesis which he defended in 1946 (PAU 1945, No. 10,291) was entitled “The Blood Morphology in birth infections and its meaning in determining severity and prognosis”. His professorial thesis entitled “The thyroid and ovulation mechanism”, was presented and defended on July 8, 1947 before the Council of the Faculty of Medicine at the Medical Academy in Gdansk (“Polish Gynaecology magazine” 1948 No. 4). Associate Professor in 1953 and Professor in 1976. From 1951 - 1955, he was the Head of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Clinic of the Medical Academy in Poznan on Polna Street. The Poznan Clinic was a large centre, but the organization of care for pregnant women was old fashioned. This involved a high mortality rate amongst mothers, fetuses and newborns. In a very short time Roszkowski introduced in Poznan and for the first time in Poland, \\"trauma meetings\\", discussing cases of complicated births. High prenatal mortality was due, amongst other reasons, to the fact that neither analysis of the reasons for death, nor autopsies of the fetuses and newborns were carried out. Roszkowski introduced changes in the care of pregnant and birthing women in his capacity as the national specialist on the National Council of the Polish Society of Gynecologists. In 1953 he delivered his paper “Methods used in the fight to reduce perinatal mortality” to the council. Since then, analysis of the causes of death of fetuses and newborns is carried out by a team including obstetricians, neonatologists, pathologists, bacteriologists, immunologists, neurologists, biochemists and other disciplines, depending on the specific clinical situation. Perinatal mortality has been reduced sevenfold. Roszkowski organized the first Polish pathology of pregnancy wards, first in Gdansk, then in Poznan and finally the biggest ward in Warsaw on Karowa Street. In 1962 at the Conference of Polish Gynecologists in Gdansk he presented a paper on the programme entitled “Pathophysiology of fetal hypoxia”. In this paper, he presented for the first time in writing, his own findings regarding hypoxia in fetuses. In 1974 at the Polish Gynaecology Society (PTG) Conference in Katowice he presented a paper titled “Pregnancy of high risk” – based on analysis of his own clinical / biochemical material. The first Polish andrology out patient clinic dealing with male specific medical problems was organized in Poznan, where they began to explore the impact of male factors on abnormal pregnancies, especially in miscarriages. This was some of the first research of this type in the world. During the years 1955 - 1979, for 24 years until his retirement, Roszkowski was Head of the II Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the Medical Academy in Warsaw at Karowa Street. This was one of the most modern clinics in Poland, which through its clinical and scientific activities became the model for other branches. Numerous clinics were established and developed and some, which were interdisciplinary in nature, such as the experimental Embryology Laboratory or the experimental Sexology Laboratory were unique units on a global scale. During these years, of the 10,319 patients, no deaths were reported amongst women associated with pregnancy or childbirth. Roszkowski was a skilled surgeon. He implemented a number of his own modification in operating methods in association with the reproductive organ. * While working in the Gdansk clinic he developed his own unique techniques in extended hysterectomy operations as a result of cervical cancer, incorporating operational methods described by Latzko and Tausig. This type of operation became known as the Latzko-Tausig-Roszkowski (LTR) method. The purpose was to cut as wide a sector of the lymphatic and connective tissue and ligaments in the pelvic region and perivaginal structure including the upper half of the vagina. This extended hysterectomy operation was the fourth method used in the world but the first in Poland. A detailed description of this operational method was presented at the XI Congress of Polish gynecologists and published in the “Polish Gynaecology” magazine in 1952, Issue 2. * He developed an original method of surgery for the treatment of stress incontinence, which consisted of two cross-seam stitches under the urethra (known as operatio crutiata). * He also developed his own method of removing uterine myoma. * He developed extended information in preventative methods in dealing with tumours of the uterus and ovary. These procedures have helped in the unnecessary removal of the ovary in young women. Throughout his working life he applied the basic principle of trying to exclude as far as possible, intra and post-operative complications. His surgical capabilities and in-depth knowledge of anatomy allowed him to carry out some of the most complicated gynecological and oncological operations. The trickiest and hardest cases came to him from all over Poland as his patients’ and their families trusted his skills. Some of the following methods were introduced for the first time in Poland: * In 1959, the obstetrical vacuum was used at the clinic on Karowa Street. * The method of freezing was used in treating erosions of the cervical vaginal shield. * The colposcopy method of examination of the shield part of the vagina in patients at risk of developing cervical cancer was introduced in the early sixties. * In 1965 for the first time, ultrasound was used to check both obstetric and gynecological patients. * The polycardiogram was introduced for the first time in the country to listen to the heartbeat of the fetus. * The system of “rooming in” in other words (mother and child together) was organized in the Maternity Ward of this clinic. * The first laboratories of gynecological pathology and cytogenetic in Warsaw were opened. * He was the first initiator and organizer of the “szkół matek – mother’s school”. There were 650 of these in 1954. They later evolved into “Szkoły Rodzenia – Birthing schools”. * In the 1950s he worked on special Partogram cards, which record all the parameters occurring during labour. This card was further introduced throughout Poland and became the lasting legacy in obstetrics. Roszkowski understood and recognized the profession of midwifery. He created the main teaching institute of midwifery in Warsaw at the Karowa clinic. He contributed to the creation of a Midwifery section in the Polish Gynaecology Institute. This section enabled the improvement of many topics associated with the profession of midwives, such as upgrading the professional skills and improving the organizational structure of the profession. The midwife became an equal partner with a specific scope of duties and a higher level of independence. The Warsaw School of Midwifery at the Karowa clinic had its own teaching staff. Students of the school and medical students attended practical lessons throughout all the hospital departments. Cooperation and healthy competition resulted in excellent teaching results. Roszkowski himself ran the practical exams with each student, before they attended the state exam. The essential result was the upgrading of the professional skills of midwives and the possibility of post-graduate education at universities not only in the field of medicine, but also psychological and pedagogical. In 1995 the Warsaw Midwifery School was given the name Professor Ireneusz Roszkowski School. This was a great event especially as the patron of the school was present. In 1968 – 1979 Roszkowski devoted a lot of time researching the causes of certain birth defects, particularly the free amino acids in the mother's blood plasma and later, both parents of children born with congenital defects. Clinical investigations were in awe of his experience and vast knowledge in the field of pathophysiology and pathology. All his procedures were dominated by concern for the welfare of the patient and their problems and he passed on these characteristics to many students and colleagues. He trained a large group of medical specialists, scientists and academics both in Poznan and Warsaw. He habilitated 18 lecturers, led 30 doctors to their doctorates, reviewed 22 doctorate works, wrote six opinions on Professor Ordinare and Extraordinare theses. Under his leadership, his assistants wrote more than 640 scientific papers (in clinics in Poznan and Warsaw). Under his watchful eye many other clinic, hospital and departmental administrators were educated. He possessed the gift of being able to clearly assess the capabilities and suitability of his fellow workers for scientific work. Professor Roszkowski's organizational and scientific activities far outgrew the boundaries of just midwifery and gynaecology. He was the author of 330 scientific papers, including 50 published abroad and was the editor of several manuals. * “Obstetrics and Female Diseases” PZWL 1954, edited by H. Gromadzki, J.Beck. I. Roszkowski, Lorentowicz. At the time, it was the only manual of obstetrics and gynaecology, released after the liberation and played a fundamental role in teaching students and doctors. * “Acute Infectious Diseases”, PZWL 1957, a collective work edited by Dr Wszelak. He was the author of the chapter “Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy” PZWL 1957 a collective work led by Dr Wszelak. Roszkowski was the author of the chapter “Infectious diseases in pregnancy and the postpartum period”. * “Modern Therapies”, PZWL 1961 led by Dr Złotnicki. Roszkowski was the author of five chapters. * “Obstetrics and Female Diseases” PZWL 1967, he was the editor of this collective work and author of six chapters. * “Gender Frigidity Problems” PZWL 1972. I. Roszkowski, K. I Imieliński. * “Gynacology and Obstetrics for Secondary Medical Schools” PZWL 1973. He was the editor of the handbook for midwives, which, for the first time in Poland, contained the latest data on the pathology of pregnancy in terms of the status of the fetus and newborn. This also fulfilled the role of a textbook for medical students and at that time was for them ‘a god send’. * “Healthy Women” PZWL 1973 – the most important popular item amongst the Professor's works. This contains the most important behavioural guidelines for women during their lives, but most importantly during their pregnancy. His scientific works include subjects such as: the etiology of birth defects, premature birth, liver disease in pregnancy, cholestasis in pregnancy, pathophysiology of blood coagulation in pregnancy, gestational diabetes, infections in pregnancy, procedural treatment for deliveries, organization of medical care during pregnancy, delivery and the newborn, the implementation of original operational techniques in gynaecology. Most Important Publications: * “Carrying out difficult births from the point of view of the good of the fetus”. * Polish Doctor's Weekly, 1953 * “Mortality of fetuses and newborns - causes and prevention”.

Based on his scientific and teaching experiences and clinical research, he produced dozens of films, of which 17 were presented at conferences in Poland and abroad. They were used throughout Poland for training purposes. For the film \\"Some causes and mechanics of damage in humans before birth\\" (1966), he received awards at scientific film festivals in Turin and São Paulo. In addition to taking part in many conventions and national symposia Roszkowski attended foreign congresses in Geneva (1954), Basel (1954), Belgrade (1959), Zagreb (1962), Dubrovnik (1963), Ljubljana (1969), Prague (1961, 1963, 1965, 1967), Moscow (1963, 1973), Berlin (1965, 1967), Bratislava (1970), Rome (1972), Lausanne (1972), Athens (1973), Uppsala (1976), Dresden (1978), Vienna (1961, 1972, 1978), Leipzig (1965) and Paris (1965, 1967). He also went abroad for training purposes and on scholarships to London and Aberdeen (1962), Bethesda and New York City (1970). From 1962 - 1982, he served as Chief editor of \\"Polish Gynaecology\\". He ensured the publication was of a very high standard and made sure that all the published articles related to the creation, not destruction of life. In one interview he said: \\"The law regarding the admissibility of abortion was introduced in 1956, however, thanks to me it was only realized in 1960. During those four years, I calculated I saved at least 750,000 lives of my compatriots. I did this primarily as a Pole for my country.” Through all his working life he fought for every child, for every pregnancy. He received patients in the Planned Family clinic so as to make future mothers aware of the consequences of interrupting their pregnancy, particularly the first pregnancy. Roszkowski was a national specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology (1952 - 1959 and 1967 - 1970). He was a regional specialist in the following provinces: Szczecin (1946 - 1947), Olsztyn (1947 - 1949), Gdansk (1945 - 1951), Poznan (1952 - 1955). He served as a regional specialist (1975 - 1979). From 1973 to 1979 he was the Director of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Warsaw. Out of choice, he served in many capacities at medical universities and scientific societies; he served as Dean (1958 - 1960) and Vice Dean (1960 - 1962) of the Medical Academy in Warsaw; took an active role on the Boards of numerous institutions and the Ministry of Health; was a longtime member of the Government Commission on Population policy; a long time Chairman of Fetus Pathophysiology Commission PAN; a member of the Science Committee on demographics; Chairman of the Medical Demography section of PAN; Chairman of the committee on natural birth defects and fetal damage PAN; a member of the Scientific Council of the Institute of Mother and Child; a scientific expert for the Central Commission for Science for the President of the Council Of Ministers. From 1974 to 1977, he served as the President of the Polish Society of Gynaecology. He was a member of many Polish and foreign scientific societies. He received various awards in Poland and abroad. Roszkowski especially prized the Gold Medal of the Polish Academy of Medicine that he received in 1991, for outstanding contributions to the development and humanisation of medicine. On the reverse was a notable inscription: \\"This Medal is a symbol of gratitude to those who create timeless values, for those who have found a place in history and in people's hearts and minds\\". In later years he was a passionate pomologist, beekeeper and worked on his land with enthusiasm. He had a large library that constantly expanded; he was interested in history and collected clocks. He read avidly. Throughout life he lived by the following principle: “if you tire of one job take up another”. Throughout his working life he benefited from the resources of the main medical library in Warsaw by familiarizing himself with the newest developments in medicine. He was thrilled with the huge progress in research in various field of medicine. He lamented that there were so few young people involved in this field. He often repeated: \\"we must never forget that we belong to the species Homo sapiens. This means we must constantly improve ourselves\\". \\"This country has had poverty for 200-300 years and we complain about our neighbors on our left and right. Development is all that can help us. Initially stimulated from the outside and then through our own autonomous internal development\\". “One talks about human development when one goes to school but development starts much earlier, from the initial contact with one’s mother, from the first feed. I once heard an elderly lady telling off a young mother that she was not talking to her child while feeding it. She told her - talk to him, otherwise he will become a bandit... \\".

Its close proximity to the Kingdom of Castile made it influenced by the local architecture. Castle of Vinhais, Bragança, Portugal History =Pre- historic= Human occupation of the region dates back to prehistoric times. The early humans left behind numerous archaeological remains, including rock art, and the megalithic monuments (dolmens) and forts.Conforme registado pelo Abade de Miragaia, que referiu: \\"Também por aqui se demoraram os Romanos, pois ao norte da vila, no monte da Vidueira, se encontraram em 1872 muitas moedas romanas bem conservadas (...).\\" =Early History= Vinhais was originally a Galician settlement that was an occasional trade center. After the Romans entered Iberia the town was turned into a Galician-Roman fortress. Regarding the location of this primitive village, scholars are divided into three hypotheses: * on a hill near the right bank of Tuela River, just north of the current site * on the hill of the Vidueira; or * on Mount Ciradela or Ciradelha, in the hills of the Crown. These assumptions are justified by the appearance of Roman coins, traces of buildings of the ancient Roman city of Veniatia, and the remains Roman military road that connected Braga to Astorga (Asturica Augusta). The Swabians and Visigoths established the village. A few centuries later the Muslim invasion of the Iberian Peninsula resulted in the increase of the castles. Medieval Castle The Vinhais village is the result of the centralization of the territory of Tras-os-Montes in so-called \\"new towns\\" of initiatives under the direct control of the Crown, better-equipped to attract and organize the services for the people. When the court clerks King Dinis (1279-1325) were preparing the 1320-1321 catalog, is not that the common Parish Church, which indicates that both the temple and the fortification have been very time-consuming construction. Will date from the reign of this sovereign, possibly from the late thirteenth century the completion of the village fence, supported by five or six towers, two of them flanking the gate. Not having citadel, the main tower integrated to the fence. Records from the late thirteenth century show the completion of the village wall supported by five or six towers, two straddling gate. Since the village did not have a citadel, the main tower was integrated to the fence. Durante a crise de 1383-1385, o Alcaide-mor de Vinhais tomou partido por D. Beatriz, vindo posteriormente a reconhecer a soberania de D. João I (1385-1433). Esse processo não terá sido pacífico, uma vez que o seu Alcaide-mor, João Afonso Pimentel, revoltou-se em 1397 contra o soberano, passando-se para Castela, tendo a praça voltado à posse portuguesa apenas em 1403. During the 1383-1385 Portuguese crises, the population of Vinhais sided with Beatriz, who later yielded to recognize the sovereignty of King John I (135-1433). This process has not been peaceful since its Alcaide-mor, João Afonso Pimentel, revolted in 1397 against the sovereign, going to Castile, and the square facing the Portuguese possession only in 1403. Under the reign of Ferdinand (1367-1433), the castle was occupied by the forces of Castile between 1369 and 1371. Later, under the reign of King Manuel I (1495-1521), the castle is assessed and recorded by the Duarte de Armas in the Book of Fortresses of 1509. The logs show general ill state of fortification: the side of the main gate, the inner face of the keep, facing the village, presents ruin and two of the remaining towers show wear on the foundations. This sovereign granted the new Foral New to the village on May 4, 1512. =From the sixteenth century to modern day= From the sixteenth century onward, despite having built one Barbican and additional towers, fortification saw the number of buildings attached to the old walls increase with the growth of the village. It is said that in 1527, the walls were already partly demolished. In the context of the War of Restoration (1640-1668), the town and its castle suffered siege. In the words of Portuguese historian: \\"In 1666, finding itself in Lisbo, Count of S. João da Pesqueira (later 1st Marquess of Távora, created by D. Pedro II Ruler of January 7, 1670), governor of Entre Douro and Távora (.. .). however, the Galician general D. BALTAZAR PANTOJA, put to fire and sword the province of Tras-os-Montes. on July 1, 1666 entered by Montalegre, on July 13 fell on keys, on July 14 places of Faiões and St. Stephen, defended by the sergeant- major ROCK AZEVEDO Antonio, committing barbarities. Gathering-up D. BALTAZAR PANTOJA to Monterey, Galician square north of Verim, and after a few days oped on Portugal, entering by Monforte, he came to put siege of Vinhais, surrounding with his army the castle, which was defended by the governor MARIS oF STEPHEN with the villagers and another 50 helpers. Several times occupied by the Castilians it became part of Portugal again in 1403. In 1659 a Spanish general invaded the region and besieged Vinhais with 1,700 men. The castle resisted and the enemy retreated across the border, burning all the houses outside the walls as well as all the villages they passed through. Although seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw some repair effort, these repairs were minor. In the twentieth century, the castle remains were classified as Public Interest Property by decree published on June 28, 1947. In the early 1960s, the City Council made an attempt to demolish the remaining parts of the castle when the population furiously opposed, furnishing up around the great memory. As a result, they were promoted consolidation and restoration work, the responsibility of the Directorate-General of National Buildings and Monuments (DGEMN) as left: three gates, two towers and some old sections of the fence, on the east side of the village. Recently, reports have given an account of the ancient towers in the old town of Vinhais, is about to collapse, putting in pedestrian and vehicular risk. Characteristics Although not much remained of the old medieval set, under the reign of King Dinis, the village built a fence with plant in irregular oval shape, enhanced by five or six towers, two of which flanked the main gate. Without possessing fortress, the keep was built the fence, confirming the Gothic type of fortification. As recorded by bequeathed to us by Duarte de Armas in the early sixteenth century, the keep stands out as a whole, defending the main gate. This gate is topped by a solid tower, supported on the outer face, on two pillars of rectangular shape. A second door reveals the Barbican, border to keep. Facing the valley is a smaller door flanked by two turrets castellated. In addition, the fence, with a perimeter of about 500 steps, was reinforced by three turrets of quadrangular. Cubelo is shown to be next to the West, opened up the well, connected by a winding staircase adjoining the barcabacã. In so enclosure rose the houses and the Church of Our Lady of the Assumption.

Life Dwyer was born in Dublin and studied the classical guitar at the DIT Conservatory of Music and Drama, Dublin, and at the Royal Academy of Music, London. He also studied music at Trinity College Dublin, and in 2000 he received a PhD in composition from Queen's University Belfast. As a guitarist, he made his concerto debut with Rodrigo's Concierto d'Aranjuez with the Neubrandenburg Philharmonic Orchestra in Germany; since then he has performed as soloist with most of the major Irish orchestras and string quartets, and he has given recitals throughout Europe and North America. He has also performed with a variety of chamber music partners, including tenor John Elwes, saxophonist Kenneth Edge, flautist Susan Doyle, jazz guitarist Mike Nielsen and classical guitarist Dario Macaluso. Dwyer spent the years 2002 to 2007 in Spain (Andalusia and Barcelona), before returning to Ireland, where he teaches guitar at the Royal Irish Academy of Music since 2009.Biography paraphrased from Mark Fitzgerald: \\"Dwyer, Benjamin\\", in: The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland, ed. by Harry White and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), p. 338–340. Since 2012 he holds the first professorship in music at Middlesex University. Dwyer has a strong interest in contemporary art music. He has been involved in the promotion and performance of new music in Ireland since 1990, when he instituted the \\"Mostly Modern\\" series and festival (later known as \\"MUSIC21\\"), and he is founder and director of the VOX21 new music ensemble, which premiered many new works by Irish and international composers. He has also been active as artistic director and organiser of concert series and festivals, bringing tailored events to the National Concert Hall and Sligo Contemporary Music Festival. Dwyer also curated \\"Remembering Ligeti\\" in 2007 and \\"Remembering Britten\\" in 2013 in Dublin. He was awarded the Villa-Lobos Centenary Medal by the Brazilian Government in 1987, elected to Aosdána in 2006, and made an Associate of the Royal Academy of Music, London, in 2009. As a musicologist, Dwyer has published monographs and written articles for the Journal of Music in Ireland. Music Among Irish composers, Benjamin Dwyer has made one of the largest and most sustained contributions to the repertoire for classical guitar. His Twelve Études, composed over a period of twelve years and completed in 2008, comprise the summation of his writing to date for the instrument. His treatment of melodic cells, exploring and reshaping their musical potential by increments, and avoiding the traditional development, can give his musical language the appearance of being extemporised. Dwyer also makes frequent use of rhythmic ostinati, as in Voces críticas (2004), the Guitar Quintet (2003) and several of the Études.Fitzgerald (2013), as above. Often in his music, conflicting ideas result not in resolution but in mutual annihilation, a process seen clearly in his Concerto for Percussion and Orchestra (2000), which illustrates the universal forces of creation (Rajas), preservation (Sattva) and destruction (Tamas) described in the Indian Vedic traditions. This piece also demonstrates Dwyer's fascination with Hindu philosophy and other ritual and mythopoetic ideas.Fitzgerald (2013), as above.

He is particularly associated with philosophical extrapolations from the Socratic Dialogue format, pioneered by his mentor and friend Leonard Nelson, with which Heckmann continued to work after Nelson died. In 1932 he was an instigator of the so-called Urgent Call for Unity (\\"Dringender Appell für die Einheit\\"), a public appeal, signed by 32 high profile intellectuals, urging the principal left wing parties to unite ahead of the first 1932 General election in order to block Nazi success. The Appeal failed in its objective, but it marked out its instigators as prominent opponents of the Nazi party: Heckmann went into exile in 1933. Twelve years later, on returning to Germany, in 1945 he became, for a few years, an influential member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). Life =Provenance and early years= Gustav Heckmann was born into a traditional \\"church and emperor\\" family at Voerde, a town in the industrial Rhineland region, at the extreme western edge of Germany. After successful completion of his schooling he volunteered for military service, serving in the war initially as a paramedic and later as a soldier. War ended in 1918 and Heckmann moved on to study Mathematics, Physics and Philosophy at Marburg, Berlin and Göttingen. It was at Göttingen that he received his doctorate in 1924. This work was supervised by Max Born. In 1925 he passed the state exam necessary for a teaching position. While still a student one of his teachers was the philosopher Leonard Nelson, and he now applied for a teaching post at the \\"Landerziehungsheim Walkemühle\\" educational institution with which Nelson was closely involved. At this stage, however, Nelson rejected his application, recommending that he instead obtain teaching experience in the public schools sector. Two years later, after complying with Nelson's non-negotiable condition that he cut all ties with the church, which had led to protracted wrangling with his parents, Heckmann was accepted as a teacher at the \\"Walkemühle\\" Philosophical-Political Academy in 1927. Nelson himself died unexpectedly at the end of October, and Heckmann served a rigorous apprenticeship under the supervision of Minna Specht who had worked closely with Nelson, and who headed up the academy between 1927 and its closure. The Walkemühle Academy was effectively the educational academy of the International Socialist Militant League (Internationaler Sozialistischer Kampfbund / ISK), which had grown out of a movement that had broken away, under the leadership of Nelson and Specht, from the mainstream Social Democratic Party in 1917. Shortly after Nelson's death Gustav Heckmann joined the ISK, leadership of which had fallen to Willi Eichler. Between 1927 and 1933 Eichler, Spricht and Heckmann worked together to promote and evolve the ISK's neo-Kantianist vision of socialism, defined through the prism of Socratic method as an ethical concept, but one bereft of the determinism implicit in the works of Karl Marx, and unimpeded by the religious distractions implicit in Christianity. Heckmann's life experiences would lead him to develop Nelson's methodology of political philosophy towards his understanding of its Socratic basis, and a more practical and less absolutist search for truth. =Nazi years and exile= The outcome of the 1930 General election came as a huge shock for Heckmann whose activities, along with those of his ISK colleagues, quickly acquired a more political focus, while his teaching work at the \\"Walkemühle\\" was suspended. In 1932, backed by Minna Specht and Hellmutt von Rauschenplat who also taught at the academy, Heckmann instigated the publication in a newspaper of the ISK's Urgent Call for Unity (\\"Dringender Appell für die Einheit\\"), a public appeal, signed by 32 high profile intellectuals, urging the Social Democratic and Communist parties to unite ahead of the first 1932 General election in order to block Nazi success. Much of the text was drafted by Heckmann himself, including a prescient and resonant warning referencing Schiller against allowing inbuilt inertia and cowardice of the heart to leave the way open for a decline into barbarism.\\"Sorgen wir dafür, daß nicht Trägheit der Natur und Feigheit des Herzens uns in die Barbarei versinken lassen!\\" Gustav Heckmann referencing Friedrich Schiller in the \\"Dringender Appell\\" (1932). By the time of the second 1932 General election, in November, the Nazi party's share of the popular vote had been cut from 37.3% to 33.1%, which was actually slightly below the combined shares of the SPD and Communist parties, but the two left- wing parties remained mutually mistrustful and the Nazi tide proved unstoppable. Régime change in January 1933 was quickly followed by the creation of Germany's first one-party dictatorship. The \\"Walkemühle\\" Academy had for most purposes been closed in 1931 in order to enable Specht, Eichler and Heckmann to concentrate on more direct opposition to the rise of the Nazi Party, and now, at the start of February 1933, its premises were taken over by members of the Nazi Party's military wing (SA). They were formally confiscated on 17 March 1933 and the Political-Philosophical Academy was proscribed under the wide ranging mandate of the Enabling Act of 24 March. While Eichler fled to Paris, Minna Specht and Gustav Heckmann escaped together to Denmark, accompanied by the children's section of the academy. In a Danish hamlet they were able to use an old manor house which was large but unmodernised. Water came via a handpump, and much effort had to be expended heating the \\"school\\" room before lessons could begin: activities were constantly overshadowed by a concern that necessary permission to operate the school might not be renewed. Although at this stage industrial scale slaughter of German Jews still lay in the future, the Nazis had lost little time in enacting Anti-Jewish legislation, and it became progressively more obvious that Jews would be disadvantaged in any Nazi future. The number of refugee schoolchildren accompanying them to Denmark was initially 15, but this increased little by little over the next couple of years to approximately 25, of whom roughly 50% were Jewish: along with teaching and maintaining the old manor house, Specht and Heckmann devoted themselves to seeking out Danish families who might be able and willing to look after Jewish children and other children of exiled or disappeared German left-wing activists, in the event of a German invasion. As the political situation in Germany evolved, at the end of 1938 Specht and Heckmann decided to relocate again, this time to Britain. A Quaker philanthropist named Peter Scott provided premises for the ten children of the senior school at Cwmavon, a short distance to the east of Swansea, while the younger children were accommodated at Abergavenny, on the far side of Merthyr Tydfil. However, Peter Scott's Welsh refuge had originally been established to support unemployed coal miners, and after its philanthropic objectives were switched it lost government support without which Scott was unable to fund it. The school moved for a period to the village of Redhill a little to the south of Bristol in England. Meanwhile, September 1939 saw the anticipated return of war between Britain and Germany. For some time it remained unclear what this would involve on the \\"home front\\": one government response had a particular impact on people who had fled from Germany to Britain in order to escape government persecution because of their race or political beliefs. Invoking Regulation 18B of the Defence (General) Regulations 1939, the government identified several thousand German refugees as enemy aliens and placed them in internment camps. Heckmann and Specht were arrested on 3 and 5 June 1940: Heckmann spent some time interned in Canada. Their refugee school children were looked after by Quakers, socialists and German refugees who had avoided arrest. In the early summer of 1941 the British government decided to release the majority of their German refugee internees on the condition that they would join the Pioneer Corps, believed to be the only British army corps prepared to accept those identified as \\"enemy aliens\\". Heckmann was shipped back from Canada to Britain and released. His duties with the Pioneer corps included transporting concrete blocks, and other building work in connections with the construction of nissen huts. Another German exile who had ended up in Britain was Heckmann's old teacher from Göttingen, Max Born, who had held a professorship at Edinburgh since 1939 and who managed to extricate Heckmann from the Pioneer Corps. He was now given war work that involved superintending the demagnetising of allied shipping in order to afford protection from German metallic mines. =Homecoming= Gustav Heckmann returned to Germany after the war. In 1945 he married Charlotte Sonntag, who had taught the exiled schoolchildren with him in Denmark and Britain. In 1946 he obtained a professorship in Philosophy and Pedagogy at the Pedagogical Academy of Hannover (as it was then known). The ISK having by now become an organisation devoted to opposing Naziism, dissolved itself now that Naziism was seen to have been destroyed. Like most former ISK members in Germany, Gustav Heckmann joined the no longer banned SPD. Within the party, however, he came into conflict with the party leadership in 1950 when he started collecting signatures of those critical of an article in the regional constitution of North Rhine-Westphalia. Heckmann and those who thought like him believed that by excessively accommodating the interests of the church, the new constitution risked limiting the freedom of conscience of teachers, with the accompanying risk that the region's schools might suffer from an excess of clerical interference. He continued to work with Leonard Nelson's vision of Socratic Method, and enriched it with new elements, notably so-called \\"Meta-Gespräch\\". A committed opponent of nuclear weaponry, he was involved from the outset in the Easter Marches in Germany, demonstrating against nuclear weapons in the East and in the West. He was a speaker at the 1960 demonstration at the Bergen-Hohne Training Area, remembered as an early \\"star march\\" (\\"Sternmarsch\\") for which protesters converged from various different starting points including, in this case, Hamburg, Bremen, Braunschweig and Hannover. † Gustav Heckmann died at Hannover on 8 June 1996. He was 98.

Following Under the Northern Sky, it features 95 poems, some of which bear first signs of the author's experiments with the Russian language's musical and rhythmical structures he would later become famous for. The book came with an epigraph from Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov: \\"Kiss the earth and love tirelessly and insatiably; love everyone and everything, keep seeking delight and ecstasy.\\" Balmont read Crime and Punishment at sixteen, and The Brothers Karamazov a year later. \\"It gave me more than any other book I've ever read,\\" he later wrote of this novel. The initial reviews by mainstream critics were lukewarm, but the Symbolist faction of the Russian artistic community embraced the book as an innovative work. In retrospect it is regarded as an important artistic statement that in many ways shaped the face of Russian literary modernism.Makogonenko, Darya. The Life and Fate.

A poem dedicated to Valery Bryusov with whom Balmont (according to the former) was 'bound by a thread of both friendship and animosity'. The two, according to Marina Tsvetayeva, \\"walked as pair... In those years once you've mentioned one, you couldn't help meaning the other one too. Balmont-Bryusov. Joint rulers.\\" Tsvetayeva considered them the Russian Symbolism's 'Mozart-and-Salieri', each signifying an extreme end of artistry. \\"Balmont: utter and complete openness. Bryusov: toughness... Childish creator (Balmont) and labourer creator (Bryusov)... Joy of giving, Balmont. Joy of possessing, Bryusov.\\" :Maximilian Voloshin described the same antinomy as: \\"the poet-magician\\" (Balmont) and \\"the poet- conqueror, the poet empire-builder, bound to set laws and thrones\\" (Bryusov).\\" :Bryusov, the driving force behind the whole Russian Symbolist movement, has been hugely influenced by Balmont and was for a while admittedly under his spell. \\"It was through Balmont that the mystery of the poetry's musicality has been revealed to me,\\" he wrote later. :Yet it was Bryusov who first noticed the early signs of crisis in Balmont's mid-1900s poetry and was quite open about it. In 1905 he wrote: \\"For a decade Balmont reigned supreme in our poetry. But now he dropped the scepter. We moved further afield. He stays where he was.\\" Balmont was sure it was just 'jealousy' on behalf of Bryusov. \\"Tell Valery I do not send him my respects,\\" he told his friends as he was departing from Russia in 1907. * \\"Ya mechtoyu lovil ukhodyashchiye teni...\\" (Я мечтою ловил уходящие тени..., I was dream-catching vanishing shadows...). A declaration of the poet's quest for artistic truth, through climbing up a symbolic stairway in pursuit of the unfathomable. \\"The symbolic method here is taken to the extreme of perfection,\\" opined the critic Ellis, who defined this method as \\"treating the real world as means to the end,\\" the spectrum of reflections,\\" and \\"the temple of symbols propped by columns of life\\" which a poet enters in order to \\"seek eternity in fleeting things, and boundlessness in all things relative and limited.\\" * \\"Voskres'shiy\\" (Воскресший, The Resurrected One). Re-evaluation of the early suicide attempt in the symbolist's terms.

Overview These were not live programs but were taped segments put together by Crosby's editor, Murdo MacKenzie. Bill Morrow wrote the scripts and produced the show; and Ken Carpenter was the commercial announcer. The music was taken from the substantial library of songs recorded with Buddy Cole and His Trio. The Ford Road Shows were not confined to Bing Crosby exclusively. The advertising technique, devised by the ad agency J. Walter Thompson was to keep Ford cars in front of the public by radio “saturation.” Thus, five-minute segments were sponsored for news and commentary as well as for entertainment. The other Ford Road Shows featured Rosemary Clooney, chit chat by Arthur Godfrey and news by Edward R. Murrow. The Ford sponsorship covered 21 shows a week for a total of $3.5 million. Rosemary Clooney's Road Shows also employed Buddy Cole and His Trio, which later led to a merger of Crosby and Clooney's shows into the Crosby-Clooney programs of 1960-62. The 5-minute programs were scattered through the program day, five days a week. Crosby's program was aired on CBS twice on Sunday, then M-W-F and on alternate weeks, T-Th-Sat. It is believed that 286 of these shows were produced for the series, which started Monday, September 2, 1957 and ended Sunday, August 31, 1958.

Until 2013, the dam provided irrigation water for two canals that serve of farmland on the west side of the Sacramento Valley. The dam and canals are part of the Sacramento Canals Unit of the Central Valley Project, operated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. In 2013, the dam was decommissioned and the river allowed to flow freely through the site in order to protect migrating fish. A pumping plant constructed a short distance upstream now supplies water to the canal system. Specifications The dam is a concrete gated weir design, long, with a structural height of . Eleven fixed wheel gates, each wide and high, control the outflow of water to the Sacramento River. The concrete piers between the gates are in width. The entire structure contains about of concrete. Lake Red Bluff, formed by the dam when the gates are lowered, had a maximum depth of , a normal storage of , and a maximum storage of . The original design of the dam included two fish ladders, one on each end of the dam; a third was added in 1984 in the middle of the dam. A diversion headworks and settling basin on the south bank of the Sacramento River originally provided a gravity flow of water to two aqueducts, the Tehama-Colusa Canal and Corning Canal. The headworks consist of six radial gates with a capacity of . This water is now lifted directly from the Sacramento River via a pumping plant constructed as part of the Red Bluff Fish Passage Improvement Project. The pumping plant has a capacity of , with potential future expansion to . The Tehama Colusa Canal, larger of the two canals, is long, with a capacity of . The Corning Canal is long and can carry . Together, the canals irrigate in Tehama, Glenn, Colusa and Yolo Counties, of which lacked sufficient water before the project was built. Six additional pumping plants are required at various points to maintain water flow in the two canals. Water is also provided to of wildlife preserves in the Sacramento Valley. The total crop value is $250 million, with total benefits of $1 billion per year to the regional economy. Construction history Although the Central Valley Project was initially authorized in 1935, the Sacramento Canals Division was not authorized until September 29, 1950 by President Harry Truman. The contract for construction of Red Bluff Diversion Dam was awarded in 1962 to Vinnell Corporation, for a total of $3,465,155. Work on the dam began in 1962 and was completed on August 9, 1964, more than 4 months ahead of schedule. The Corning Canal had been completed by 1959, but the much larger Tehama Colusa Canal was not completed until 1980. Environmental impact While the dam is relatively small, it has historically blocked passage of salmon, steelhead and sturgeon runs on the Sacramento River with resulting detrimental impact on these fish populations. This occurred both due to improper construction of the fish ladders on the dam, and turbulence caused by water diversion which disorient migrating fish. A fish screen was installed between 1969 and 1971 to prevent fish from entering the canal headworks, and a new fish ladder was later constructed at a cost of $17 million. Starting in 1987, the dam gates were left open between December 1 and April 1 to help the winter Chinook salmon run. However, this did not have an appreciable impact on fish populations; in 1991, the winter Chinook count hit a record low of 191, down from 118,000 in 1969. The spring Chinook salmon run has not been as severely impacted by dam operations. By 2008, the dam gates were open in all months except for the primary irrigation season of mid-May to mid-September, but the migrating fish count remained low. In 2009, the National Marine Fisheries Service mandated that the dam gates be opened year round, allowing the river to flow freely. A new pumping plant and fish screen was constructed upstream to divert water into the Tehama-Colusa and Corning Canals. These works effectively made the Red Bluff dam obsolete. In 2013, the Bureau of Reclamation awarded E.C. Smith Inc. a contract of $3.28 million to decommission the dam. While the dam is not planned to be removed, its gates are permanently locked in the open position. The decommissioning has been controversial, as it resulted in the loss of Lake Red Bluff, the reservoir originally formed behind the dam and a popular recreation spot in the area. The total cost of restoring fish populations above Red Bluff Dam has reached about $180 million.

Since 1903 he worked as professional photographer documenting the soon to be demolished houses in the streets of Prague for Municipal Building Authority. In 1896 he first saw Lumière brothers' cinematograph in Prague. In 1898 he bought his own cinematograph together with his friend Josef František Pokorný. He started showing Lumières' as well as his own short documentary films at pavillion in Prague's Výstaviště during Architecture and Engineering Exhibition in June 1898. Kříženecký staged, directed, developed and showed his films by himself. Lumière brothers even bought some of his short movies. He was the only professional Czech filmmaker until 1908. His filmmaking career ended in 1912. After that he worked as a projectionist for cinemas Louvre (1912–1915), Kino (1915–1916) and Světozor (1916–1921). He died forgotten in 1921 and none of the four Czech film magazines at that time reported his death. His achievements were re-discovered by film historian Karel Smrž in 1930s.

History In 2007 NEC Corporation, Nissan Motor Company, and NEC Tokin agreed to establish a lithium-ion battery company focused on development to production of batteries for electric vehicles; in 2008 the company was established with a capital of ¥1.5 billion ($14.3million) with a 51:42:7 Nissan:NEC:NEC TOKIN shareholding; the business was to establish a manufacturing site at Nissan's facility in Zama, Kanagawa c.2009, with an initial capacity of 13,000 units per year, rising to 65,000 units per year on an investment of ¥12 billion ($114.6 million). The plant was to be supplied with lithium manganese electrode from NEC TOKIN's factory in Sagamihara, Kanagawa; itself upgraded at a cost of ¥11 billion ($128million). Initial markets were to be forklift trucks, followed by electric and hybrid vehicles manufactured by Nissan. Initial production of the Lithium Manganese Oxide battery (LiMn 2O4) LMO was based on a manganese spinel cathode, with batteries formed from laminated cells. The battery (L3-10) was a unit of 13Ah, 3.6V with a power density of 2060W/kg (2.5V @ 20 °C). In late 2008 the joint owners announced they were investing a further ¥100 billion ($1.1 billion) in AESC, establishing an additional factory to increase capacity for around 200,000 vehicles per year. Trial production at Zama began mid 2009. In 2010 the Nissan Leaf electric vehicle began production, using batteries from AESC. In 2014 AESC was the second largest electric vehicle battery manufacturer worldwide (after Panasonic), with 21% of the market. In late 2014 Reuters reported conflict within the Nissan / Renault carmaker alliance over sourcing of battery packs for its Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK and Nissan Smyrna assembly plant (USA) car battery plants due to lack of price competitiveness with rival cell manufacturer LG Chem - Nissan was reported to have signed contracts to take all of NEC's electrode production, irrespective of sales. In 2016, Nissan decided to sell its 51% stake in AESC, preferring external suppliers. In December, 2016 Carlos Ghosn explains that being tied to internal battery manufacturing does not allow for the flexibility of buying cheaper third party batteries.https://www.forbes.com/sites/bertelschmitt/2016/12/16/carlos-ghosn- explains-why-making-your-own-batteries-is-dumb In mid 2017 Nissan announced it was to sell its battery businesses including AESC (including acquiring the 49% NEC stake) to Chinese investment company GSR Capital for ~$1 billion. However, this sale did not actually happen and after three delays was canceled in July 2018 as intended buyer GSR Capital did not complete funding for the sale. In Aug 2018, Nissan announced it would sell its electric car battery unit to Chinese renewable group Envision Group, while retaining a 25% stake. The sale included AESC as well as battery manufacturing plants in USA (Tennessee) and England (Sunderland). NEC's 49% stake was also to be sold to Envision. In April 2019 the company, announced plans to open a new 20GWh capacity battery plant in Wuxi, Jiangsu, China, roughly triple its production capacity of 7.5GWh/pa.

During the competition, a robot provided by the organizer will be controlled by all finalists via an interface, whereby various tasks will be performed. In this edition of the Challenge, prizes were awarded in three categories even before the actual start. *Best Science Design: ERIG e.V. ORTHOS, Germany – for depth analysis and showing a truly interdisciplinary approach *Best Docs: STAR Dresden e.V, Germany – excellent preparation of documentation according to ERC rules and showing great professionalism *Best Design: AGH Space System, Poland – for the overall best design of ERC rover Winners: *1st place: ERIG e.V., Germany *2nd place: RoverOva, Czech Republic *3rd place: DJS Antariksh, India and Robocol, Colombia  Tasks  thumb During the competition the teams have to complete five tasks: # Science Task – The first task is to take soil samples (including one from a deep layer of the Mars Yard) by using any technique (e.g.: drilling) and secure them properly for testing; # Maintanance Task – The teams must maneuver their robots to complete a designated route towards a control panel and perform several manual operations, such as setting switches to the right position, making electric measurements, observing control panels, etc.; # Collection Task – In order to complete this task, rovers must find and collect containers with samples from three different locations and then deliver them to a designated place safely; # Traverse Task – The task is to find different points in the Mars Yard without using the image from the rover’s camera. Rovers should navigate themselves using only a map; # Presentation Task – In the given time limit the teams must present themselves, their project stages, and the biggest challenges they faced while constructing the rover. Team members also must be prepared for potential jurors’ questions. The tasks are based on roadmaps – documents used in planning strategic missions of NASA and ESA. They are completed in the Mars Yard created from several tons of soil in the color reminding the surface of Mars. It includes natural obstacles copying the Martian landscapes. Unlike other competitions of this kind, it is not allowed to use GPS during the ERC and team members do not see the robots they are navigating. They can only use their robot’s camera view.thumb  Bibliography    References Category:Mars rovers Category:Robotics competitions Category:Rover Challenge Series ","title":"European Rover Challenge"},{"id":"49427525","text":"Harold Emil (\\"Bud\\") Rohrschach Jr. (1926 - 1993) was an American physicist.

He is credited with establishing modern Bangladeshi agriculture and food self- sufficiency, having developed 60 superior strains of rice. Hedayetullah took great interest in religious and social work as well. He was instrumental in the reconstruction of the Amber Shah Mosque at Karwanbazar, Dhaka, development of which has subsequently been taken up by the Bangladesh Government. Biography Hedayetullah was born in the Bogra District, Bengal Presidency, British India (now Bangladesh) in 1904. He passed the entrance examination from Maldah Zilla School (now in West Bengal, India) in 1920. He studied at the Presidency College, Calcutta, as a resident of Baker Hostel and secured BSc (Honors) degree in 1926 and MSc degree in 1928 from the Calcutta University in botany. He was offered a state scholarship from the Government of India to study at King's College London from 1929 to 1932. He conducted studies on the cytology and cytogenetics of the Narcissus species and received his PhD degree from University of London in 1932. He joined Science College, Calcutta, as a senior lecturer in botany in 1933, but left to join the position of Economic Botanist, Government of Bengal in 1935. In 1945 he succeeded G. W. Podwick as the principal of Dhaka Agricultural College (now Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University). In 1949, he was appointed Director of Agriculture, Government of East Pakistan(Bangladesh). He was a liaison officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of Pakistan from 1956 to 1958. After he retired from government service in 1958 he was appointed head of research division at the Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research Laboratories (now called Science laboratory) Dhaka and continued in that position until 1964. From 1964 to 1968, he was a scientific advisor to the Pakistan Jute Mills Association. Hedayetullah was also the dean, Faculty of Agriculture of Dhaka University. He was a master's degree supervisor of Kazi Badruddoza, a pioneer of the agricultural research system in Bangladesh, at Dhaka University. Research During his tenure as Economic Botanist to the Government of Bengal, Hedayetullah was charged with the responsibility of conducting entomological, horticultural, pathological and statistical studies of crops at the Central Agricultural Research Station, Monipur, Dhaka. During this time he consolidated rice research in the Presidency of Bengal into an integrated program. Outstanding local and aus rice varieties that were developed are: dharial, galsura, baish-beesh, dular, pasur, doudir, maliabhanger, Naigershail, and other gene source material brought from Nigeria etc. Dahrial is still one of the leading rice varieties of Bangladesh with a short production cycle of 110 days. Gabura and baish-beesh became the outstanding deep water varieties of the Meghna and Dhaleswari flood plains. They are low input varieties, and under his leadership, matching production technology was also developed for the optimisation of production. While he was in charge of the science laboratory in Dhaka, he realised that the British Government had almost exhausted and taken away all germplasms of some medicinal plants, particularly Rauvolfia species which is used for remission of hypertension. He pioneered the collection of available species of the genus Rauvolfia globally, a majority of them from Africa, namely R. caffra and R. mombasiana (Rauvolfia serpentina is locally known as \\"Sorpogandha\\"). The majority of his germplasm of Rauvolfia had been transferred to the Botanical garden of Bangladesh Agricultural University Mymensingh by M. Azhar Hossain who did his master's degree thesis on these species under the late Professor Asraful Haque (citation needed). Hedayetullah and C.D. Darlington of Great Britain were both students of Ruggle Gates. Hedayetullah was also involved in the development of transplanted aman varieties of rice. Among thems developed, dudshal is popular in Rajshahi Division for characteristic drought tolerance and nigarshail, a fine grain variety, has remained the outstanding local variety of transplanted aman of Dhaka and Chittagong Divisions. Due to its photosensitivity, nigarshail planted in September can provide a good yield. It is thus suitable for flood affected areas of Bangladesh. In recognition of his research and contribution in improving rice crops, the British Government bestowed upon Hedayetullah the title of \\"Khan Bahadur\\". He also made contributions in horticulture plants. Hedayetullah was also very active in many government bodies, scientific societies and associations. He was a Fellow of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences and the Bangladesh Academy of Sciences. For his contribution in agriculture, Hedayetullah was awarded \\"Sitara-e- Imtiaz\\" by President Ayub Khan of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. He became the fellow of FLS and FRMS societies of England. Many of his cytological preparations were included in several text books written by the then cytologists around the world. His masterpiece of cytological and cytogenetical works on Narcissus species were published in the journal of the Royal Microscopical Society of Great Britain in the early nineteen thirties. Death Hedayetullah died in Dhaka on 29 August 1973. He was survived by his two daughters, Sakina and Salima. His daughter Salima Zahiruddin, married to architect Shah Alam Zahiruddin, continues to reside in Dhaka.

Description The altarpiece was painted in 1631-1632 as an ex voto after the ebbing of the plague epidemic in 1630 in Bologna. The altarpiece was in the past paraded yearly in a formal procession from the Palazzo Pubblico to the church of San Domenico, Bologna. The structure of the painting follows the formal arrangement, exemplified by a late 16th-century canvas by Annibale Carraci in the Pinacoteca of Bologna.Madonna and Child in Glory with Saints Lodovico, Alessio, John the Baptist, Catherine, Francis, and Clare (1587-1588), by Annibale Carraci, Pinacoteca Nazionale of Bologna. The Madonna and child are in the superior portion. The infant blesses with his right hand, while the left hand holds a flowering sprig. Around the couple, cherubim are active draping flowers, holding rosaries and scapulars, and crowning the Virgin with a floral crown. In the scene below, the seven saints implore for Bologna, depicted at the bottom center. Charles Borromeo, recently canonized, at the left was known for his work among the pestilent of Milan. Beside him standing is St Proculus of Bologna, a martyred Roman soldier, holding a sword and palm leaf (symbol of Martyrdom). Across the canvas, the armored St Florian holds a halberd and palm leaf.

In 1929, the Lwoffs were awarded a laboratory at the Pasteur Institute, where they studied Haemophilus metabolism and discovered the role of cozymase. Marguerite Lwoff published her solo research in 1940 on trypanosome metabolism, where she elucidated the role of hematin. Though the Lwoffs continued their partnership, Andre began to receive more and more credit and Marguerite was generally discounted as simply a technician.

He worked as the editorial cartoonist for the Sonoma Index-Tribune, a California newspaper, for more than 25 years. Maurer also authored and created several syndicated comic strips, including \\"Old Harrigan\\" during the 1960s and \\"Abracadabra\\" during the 1970s, which were published nationwide. Additionally, Maurer created and authored newspaper puzzles, including \\"Challenger,\\" a number puzzle which was published by King Features Syndicate twenty times per month. Linus Maurer was the namesake for the character Linus van Pelt, in Charles M. Schulz's Peanuts comic strip. Maurer and Schulz had been classmates at Minneapolis College of Art and Design (MCAD) and remained lifelong friends. Both men also worked together at the Art Instruction Schools Inc. in Minneapolis while Schulz was creating Peanuts. Schulz would name Linus van Pelt, who is known for his blue security blanket in the Peanuts comic strip, after his friend and colleague. He would later write in a book marking the 50th anniversary of Peanuts, \\"Linus came from a drawing that I made one day of a face almost like the one he now has...I experimented with some wild hair, and showed the sketch to a friend of mine who sat near me at art instruction, whose name was Linus Maurer. It seemed appropriate that I should name the character Linus.\\" Schulz and Maurer continued to meet for coffee at Snoopy's Home Ice skating rink in Santa Rosa, California, until Schulz died in 2000. Following MCAD, Maurer moved to New York City, where he worked as an illustrator for AT&T; and IBM. In 1962, he relocated to San Francisco to accept a position as the art director with the McCann Erickson ad agency. He also worked as an art director at Wells Fargo in San Francisco as well. He eventually left the corporate world and opened his own office in the city's Ghirardelli Square. He created several comic strips during the 1960s and 1970s, including \\"Old Harrigan,\\" \\"Abracadabra\\" and \\"In the Beginning.\\" Maurer moved from San Francisco to the Sonoma Valley following the death of his wife. He worked as an editorial cartoonist for more than 25 years in Sonoma. Maurer suffered from heart disease and Parkinson's disease during his later years, but continued to draw until shortly before his death. He died in Sonoma, California, on January 29, 2016, at the age of 90. He was predeceased by his wife and survived by his partner of 26 years, Mary Jo Starsiak. Both Maurer and Starsiak were widowers when they first met in Sonoma, California.

His activities have influenced several key area of environmental policy in the UK, including the decision to ban lead in petrol, introduce catalytic converters in petrol driven vehicles, and change official guidelines on exposure to ionising radiation. His letters and articles have raised awareness of ozone depletion and global warming.  Education  Although Russell-Jones was a medical scholar at Peterhouse, Cambridge he graduated with a degree in the History of Art. He completed his clinical training at St Thomas’ Hospital, London, obtained his MRCP in 1974 and specialized in dermatology. He holds both FRCP and FRCPath.  Biography  In 1981 Russell-Jones became Medical and Scientific Advisor to CLEAR, The Campaign for Lead-Free Air. In 1982 he organized an international conference on the biological effects of low level lead exposure, and the subsequent proceedings, Lead versus Health, were edited with Michael Rutter FRS, Professor of Child Psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry. In 1983 Russell-Jones gave evidence to the Royal Commission on Environmental pollution whose Ninth report, Lead in the Environment, persuaded the UK Government to introduce lead-free petrol. In 1986 he organized a conference on the biological effects of low level exposure to ionizing radiation, and the subsequent proceedings were edited with Sir Richard Southwood FRS, Professor of Zoology at Oxford, and Chair of the NRPB. International cancer risk estimates were subsequently revised upwards and dose limits for nuclear workers and the public were lowered. In 1988 he organized a conference on ozone depletion, and the subsequent proceedings were edited with Professor Tom Wigley who at that time was head of the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia.The following year Margaret Thatcher hosted a UN conference in London on ozone depletion which led eventually to the Montreal protocol. In 1989 he wrote an editorial for The Lancet, Health in the Greenhouse, which concluded as follows: “Any strategy to combat global warming must be conducted on a global scale and is bound to involve enormous investment in energy conservation, re-afforestation, renewable sources of energy and changing patterns of agriculture and transportation This approach will require a new agenda for world leaders, a new role for the United Nations Environmental Programme, and a new awareness of man’s fundamental reliance on the integrity of world ecosystems. The expense may be considerable, but the cost of doing nothing is incalculable.” In 2012 he established a small educational charity Help Rescue the Planet and organized an international conference at the Royal Institute of British Architects, London on climate change.

From 1949 to 1953, he was banned from publishing under his own name. Arrested in March 1953, he was held without trial at a jail for political prisoners in Bucharest until being released, without explanation, in July 1954. During the next seven years, he continued to write, published two books, and worked as an insurance clerk. In July 1961, together with his wife and two daughters, he settled in Paris. During his remaining decade of life, Silviu continued to write poetry and work on a novel inspired by his incarceration. He is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery.

Life  Margaret Agnew was born in 1771, in Bishop Auckland, England. Her father, Robert Agnew, was the lieutenant governor of the Isle of Man. Margaret defied social and religious conventions by marrying her maternal uncle, Harman Blennerhassett, a wealthy Irish aristocrat. They shared a 7,000-acre estate in County Kerry until 1795, when their union and Harman's revolutionary ideals prompted them to sell the estate and immigrate to America. Margaret is said to have been above average height with brown hair and blue eyes. She often wore her hair bound in a silk headdress. She wrote and spoke French and Italian fluently. She would often accompany her husband on hunting trips and enjoyed horseback riding. The couple left London and sailed to New York City in America. Once there they traveled south to Pittsburgh, PA and then chartered a boat down the Ohio River. The couple settled briefly in Marietta, Ohio. In 1797, they purchased 174 acres of land on an island in the upper Ohio River, in Wood County, Virginia (now West Virginia). The island is located two miles below present- day Parkersburg, West Virginia, a town which was named Newport until 1810. This land originally belonged to George Washington. The 7,000-square foot Blennerhassett Mansion was constructed between 1798 and 1800. In the meantime, the couple lived in a blockhouse near their property. Sketch of the mansion At the Blennerhassett Mansion, Margaret entertained travelers of the Ohio Valley in the mansion with dancing, music, and readings of poetry and Shakespeare. Among the most famous guests was former vice president Aaron Burr, who sought the financial support of numerous wealthy landowners including Harman Blennerhassett. Between 1805 and 1806, Harman and Burr took part in a treasonous conspiracy to either annex Texas or form a new country in the western United States. While Margaret was in Marietta, Harman and his associates boarded boats and escaped down the river into the Mississippi Territory. The following day, the militia of Wood County, Virginia, ransacked the mansion, despite Margaret's pleas to spare their home. She was forced to flee down the river with her two children in tow. Harman Blennerhassett and Aaron Burr were both arrested and imprisoned in the Virginia State Penitentiary until they were granted freedom. The trial in Richmond had exhausted the Blennerhassett's accounts. The following years were met with financial hardships and moving through different states and countries. The Blennerhassetts first turned to growing cotton in Mississippi. During the War of 1812 embargo, they relocated to Montreal, Quebec, Canada. After Harman tried and failed at setting up a law firm, he returned to Europe while Margaret and the children stayed in Montreal. In 1825, Margaret and her children joined Harman in Europe. Harman died in 1831. Margaret remained in Europe until 1842, when she and son Harman Jr., returned to the United States. She petitioned Congress for restitution for the Blennerhassett Mansion’s destruction. Although a Senate committee voted in favor of her appeal, she died June 16, 1842, in a poor house in New York City. The Sisters of Charity buried her in a New York cemetery. Together Margaret and Harman had six children. Two sons, Dominic (1799) and Harman (1803), were born to them during their time on the island. A baby girl, named Margaret, was also born during their time on the island but did not survive infancy. Another girl also named Margaret was born during their time in Mississippi. Their youngest child, Joseph, was born in 1812. Their home on the island remained empty for many years before finally burning to the ground. Between 1984 and 1991, the State of West Virginia reconstructed the Blennerhassett Mansion on its original foundations. The mansion and island comprise Blennerhassett Island Historical State Park. In 1996, the bodies of Margaret and Harman Jr. were reburied on the island in an historical Episcopal ceremony.  Publications  Replica of the mansion on Blennerhassett Island Margaret is considered the first published poet from what is now West Virginia. While in Montreal, she published two collections of poetry, The Deserted Isle in 1822, and The Widow of the Rock and Other Poems in 1824. Blennerhassett's life was also the subject of a 1901 novel, Blennerhassett; or, The Decrees of Fate, by Charles Felton Pidgin.

Design SRB-A is 2.5 meters in diameter, and 15.1 meters in length. Its casing is a Carbon- fiber-reinforced polymer filament wound composite. Two-axis attitude control is provided by electrically-actuated thrust vectoring. The composite motor case design is based on technology used on the Castor 120 motor by Alliant Techsystems. Versions =SRB-A= The original SRB-A was developed for the H-IIA rocket, and was used on its first 6 flights. It was derived from the SRB used on H-II. During the sixth launch of an H-IIA, one of the boosters failed to separate due to a leak of hot gasses eroding the detachment points, causing the rocket to fail to reach orbit. =SRB-A2= SRB-A2 was a planned upgrade, intended to replace SRB-A on H-IIA. Following the 2003 failure, it was cancelled and its design improvements were merged into the SRB-A Improved. =SRB-A Improved= An improved version of SRB-A was developed following the 2003 incident. The nozzle was changed from a conical to a bell shape, to reduce thermal loading and erosion. Its thrust was also reduced slightly, and its burn time lengthened, to further decrease heating. This version was flown on the seventh through the thirteenth H-IIA. However, the nozzle erosion problem was still not fully solved, leading to the development of the SRB-A3 =SRB-A3= SRB-A3 is the current version, redesigned to provide higher performance and improve reliability. It is available in two variants, one producing high thrust at a short duration burn, and the other with a longer duration lower thrust burn.

It is based in Nadi, Fiji and has membership of organisations from the Cook Islands, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, as well as a Melanesian regional organisation. Although operating informally since 2009, its first formal foundation meeting was held in April 2013 in Nadi, when 13 organisations were represented and PIFON became operational as a legal entity in its own right. Purpose PIFON was established to provide support to the small national farmer organisations in the region through coordinating capacity building, sharing success stories, and supporting regional exchanges of expertise, thus potentially enabling smallholder farmers to play an important role in agricultural value chains. The founder members noted that while farmer organisations had in the past depended on a high level of donor support, this support had often been sporadic. Moreover, because of their limited resources the organisations had been unable to clearly articulate their needs. It was therefore considered important to develop business activities to promote farmer organisation sustainability, while not detracting from their core values and objectives. Activities and support PIFON carries out three broad types of activities: to enhance sustainability of national members; to provide practical information to enable farmers to carry out income-generating activities; and to support members in promoting sustainable production practices. Within the Pacific region it has identified opportunities for farmers to supply growing urban and tourism markets, expand tree crop exports, and exploit niche product exports based on fairtrade and organic certification. Since its establishment PIFON has received support from International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the European Commission and Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA). It has also signed a partnership agreement with the Pacific Community (SPC).

Taxonomy Neosilurus hyrtlii has been given many common names, including common eel-tail catfish, Glencoe tandan, Hyrtl's tandan, inland catfish, moonfish, moony, Morton's tandan, mottled tandan, salmon catfish, silver moonfish, straight-backed catfish, white tandan, yellow fin tandan and yellow-finned catfish. Austrian naturalist Franz Steindachner described the species in 1867, from the Fitzroy River in Queensland. Description This catfish is generally between in length, though larger fish to 30 cm long are not uncommon. Fish of up to have been recorded from the Alligator River. Female fish are a little larger than male fish. The head is wide and mildly flattened with four pairs of barbels. It has a sturdy dorsal spine, the inside edge of which is serrated. Large fish are dark brown or grey above fading to whitish below with dark brown to black (or rarely yellow) fins. The male and female have silver flanks and yellow fins during spawning. Distribution and habitat Neosilurus hyrtlii is found across northern Australia, from the Ashburton River in the Pilbara in Western Australia, through the Kimberley, where it is found in most rivers, and across the Northern Territory and into the river systems that drain into the Gulf of Carpentaria in Queensland. In inland Australia, it has been recorded from the Diamantina, Georgina, Cooper, Bulloo and Finke Rivers. It is abundant in rivers on the western side of Cape York, though less common on the east coast. It is found down the east coast as far as the Mary River in southeastern Queensland, as well as Fraser Island. During the day, it keeps close to the river floor, generally at depths of around , and forages in shallow water to 30 cm deep at night. It has been found in water as warm as at Cooper Creek. Feeding Like most catfish, N. hyrtlii is mainly benthic, that is, feeding on or in the river floor. Its prey is small considering its size, comprising small molluscs (both bivalves and gastropods), crustaceans, detritus, mayfly nymphs and caddisfly larvae and midge larvae. Ecology Natural predators of N. hyrtlii include the barramundi, fork-tailed catfish and tarpon.

Despite major lifestyle adjustments, the language barrier,\\"GOPHER SPOTLIGHT: DALY SANTANA\\" and making her college debut in one of the toughest conferences in the nation, Santana's freshman season was a successful one, her performance earning her a unanimous selection to the Freshman All-Big Ten team. Her 56 service aces that year led the Gophers,\\"STATISTICAL LEADERS\\" ranked 3rd in the Big Ten,\\"2012 Big Ten Volleyball Overall Statistics\\" and 5th nationally.\\"NCAA Statistics Individual Rankings 2012-13\\" The Gophers reached the Regional Finals of the 2012 NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Tournament, and Santana was named to the NCAA All-Tournament Team. In 2014, Santana was an AVCA All-America honorable mention. That year, she was joined at Minnesota by a former teammate in the Puerto Rico Youth National Team, libero Dalianliz Rosado.

In 2015, it all came together for Santana and the Gophers. After a shaky 1–2 start, the Gophers won their second Big Ten Conference championship\\"GOPHER VOLLEYBALL WINS BIG TEN TITLE\\" in program history and headed back to the NCAA Tournament with a 26–4 record and the top seed in their region, earning coach Hugh McCutcheon both the 2015 Big Ten Coach of the Year award\\"Big Ten Announces 2015 Postseason Volleyball Honors\\" and the AVCA Coach of the Year award at the national level.\\"MCCUTCHEON NAMED NATIONAL COACH OF THE YEAR\\"\\"Hugh McCutcheon Wins AVCA Coach of the Year\\" They reached the NCAA Final Four for the fourth time in program history, where they lost to the Texas Longhorns.

Categorized as a work by Rembrandt for many years, doubts were expressed as to its provenance in 1984 by a Dutch curators' commission specifically created to investigate Rembrandt works of questionable authenticity. They made their remarks while viewing the painting in West Berlin. In November 1985, Berlin-based art expert Jan Kelch announced that important details in the painting's style did not match the style of Rembrandt's known works, and that the painting was probably painted in 1650 by one of Rembrandt's students. \\"It is not a fake,\\" Kelch averred. \\"It remains a great masterful work.\\"\\"Painting not Rembrandt's: Expert\\", The Ottawa Citizen, November 20, 1985, Page D20 The Man with the Golden Helmet is an example of Dutch Golden Age painting and is now in the collection of the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin.

Convicted of three murders, she was imprisoned for 16 years before being sent to an elderly care facility to serve out the remainder of her sentence, due to her advanced age.  Murders  Nilda Gamba, a neighbor of Murano's died on 10 February 1979. On 19 February, Murano's friend, Leila Chicha Formisano de Ayala, died. Murano owed money to both women, and both bodies showed signs of cyanide poisoning. On 24 March 1979, Murano's cousin, Carmen Zulema del Giorgio de Venturini, fell and died on the stairs of a building on Hipólito Yrigoyen Street, where she lived. Zulema's death was initially attributed to cardiac arrest. Zulema's daughter found that a promissory note worth 20 million Argentine peso ley was missing from her mother's belongings. The building's doorman said that Murano arrived for a visit carrying a mysterious package (which was later discovered to contain masas finas), and had casually asked for a copy of the keys to Zulema's apartment keys, saying, \\"I need her notebook to warn her relatives\\". Murano entered her cousin's apartment and left quickly, carrying papers and a jar. She complained loudly: \\"My God, it's my third friend to die in a short time!\\" During the autopsy, examiners discovered cyanide in Zulema's body. Investigators discovered the poison in the jar mentioned by the doorman, and in the masas finas.  Arrest  On 27 April 1979, the police arrested Murano at her home on Mexico Street. In 1980, she was found unconscious in the prison where she was being held; later, they removed one of Murano's lungs. Murano was convicted in 1985, during the Trial of the Juntas. She insisted upon her innocence, saying: \\"I never invited anyone to eat.\\" Murano was released from prison after 16 years. It was learned that she sent the judges who released her a box of chocolates as a token of her appreciation.  Media  Argentinian writer Marisa Grinstein included Murano in her book Mujeres Asesinas (Killer Women). In 2006, an episode of the Canal 13 television series of the same name featured a recreation of Murano's crimes. At the end of the episode, the real Yiya Murano appeared and proclaimed her innocence, citing evidence.

Persicaria decipiens is a trailing plant whose stems grow horizontally at first but become more vertical with time, reaching high. Its narrow elliptic to lanceolate (spear-shaped) leaves are long and across. The slender pink flower spikes appear from November to June, with a peak in February. Cylindrical in shape, they are not stiff and tend to bend over. The plant tends to die back in winter and regenerate after water. Persicaria decipiens was among the plants collected by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander on 5 May 1770 at Botany Bay during the first voyage of Captain James Cook. Prolific Scottish botanist Robert Brown described the species as Polygonum decipiens in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. It was given its current name by Karen Wilson in 1988 as the broadly defined genus Polygonum was split into smaller genera. Common names include slender knotweed, willow weed and snake root. Flowerhead P. decipiens is found in water and wet soil. It is found across Africa and the Mediterranean, through southwestern Asia, Malesia and all states of Australia, as well as Norfolk Island, New Zealand and New Caledonia. It has become naturalised in Madagascar. Likely pollinators of its flowers are insects, including honeybees, native bees, flies, wasps and small butterflies. Persicaria decipiens is not cultivated but is eaten locally in times of famine in Africa.

Her career was closely tied to that of Hu Yaobang. She was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution because of her association with Hu, rose to prominence after he became General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in 1982, and lost her position as party chief of Jiangxi after Hu's downfall in 1987. Life and career Wan was born in August 1930 in a village near Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province. Her parents were primary school teachers, and she is said to have descended from a Song dynasty defense minister. Wan studied economics at National Chung Cheng University (now Nanchang University), where she participated in underground Communist activities in 1948. She formally joined the Communist Party (CPC) in 1952, after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, and became a local leader in the Communist Youth League of China (CYL) and the official trade union. Besides Nanchang, she also worked in Shaanxi Province under the CYL leader Hu Yaobang, whom she befriended. During the Cultural Revolution, she was persecuted for her association with Hu Yaobang, and was incarcerated and physically abused. She was denounced as a capitalist roader and a follower of the fallen leaders Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and Hu. She was politically rehabilitated in 1974 and returned to work in Jiangxi. After Deng Xiaoping took power and began the reform era, Wan gained prominence thanks to her friendship with Hu, who became General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in 1982. She rose through the ranks in Jiangxi, working in labour and women's affairs. In 1984 she became head of the Jiangxi CPC Organization Department and a member of the Provincial Party Standing Committee. On 16 June 1985, she was elected by the Jiangxi Party Congress as the Provincial Party Committee Secretary. She gained attention worldwide as the first woman to hold a top provincial leadership position in the PRC. Wan did not complete her term as Party Chief of Jiangxi, mainly because Hu Yaobang was purged in January 1987. In June 1988, she left her posts in Jiangxi and became briefly deputy party secretary of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, maintaining her provincial rank. In December 1988, she was appointed deputy head of the United Front Work Department, in charge of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan affairs, and served in that position until September 1995. Starting in 1993 she also served two terms as a member of the National People's Congress Standing Committee; in 1998, she was named deputy chair of the National People's Congress Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee. She is the honorary president of China Charity Federation. Legacy Wan is best known as the first female provincial party chief in China. It would be more than 20 years before another woman, Sun Chunlan, took on the top provincial office, of Fujian, in 2009. However, Wan's background in the youth league, the trade union, and women's work was not well suited for running a provincial economy in the reform era. During her tenure, the economic growth of Jiangxi lagged behind neighbouring provinces, especially the coastal provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. On the other hand, Wan made great contribution to women's work in her home province. She implemented major policies to improve the life of women, set up schools to train female cadres, organized public lectures to raise women's awareness of their rights, and drafted regulations protecting women and children. In 1984, the All-China Women's Federation issued an unprecedented circular calling for other women cadres to learn from Wan's leadership. Personal life After her divorce in the late 1960s, Wan raised her daughter as a single mother.

High school Power became Westborough High School's starting varsity quarterback during his freshman year when his brother Tom, who was supposed to be the varsity starter, separated his shoulder before the season started and was out for the year. By Mike's senior season, he was one of the best quarterbacks in Central Massachusetts. He led Westborough to a 10–1 record and defeated Fitchburg 25–7 to win Westborough's first and currently only football championship. In addition to playing football, Power was also a starting guard on Westborough High School's basketball team and a starting outfielder on their baseball team. Boston College Power always planned to attend Boston College. His father and uncle played for the Boston College Eagles men's basketball team and one of his cousins, Frank Power, was a long-time assistant basketball coach. Power committed to BC in November 1984. In addition to Power, Boston College signed Parade High School All-Americans Mark Kamphaus and David Thompson, as well as Ed Duran. During their freshman season, coach Jack Bicknell moved Thompson and Duran to defense, which allowed Power to moved up to second on the depth chart, behind Shawn Halloran. Halloran struggled during the Eagles' 1986 season opener and Power replaced him. He completed 9 of 17 passes for 64 yards and ran for another 42 yards in three quarters before suffering a foot injury that kept him out for the rest of the season. Entering his sophomore season, Power competed with Mark Kamphaus for the starting job. Ten days before the season opener, Bicknell named Power the starter and Power finished the season as the team's leading passer. He completed 133 of 233 passes for 2,071 yards, 10 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions. His 8.9 passing yards per attempt were fourth best in Division I football, behind Don McPherson of Syracuse, Chuck Hartlieb of Iowa, and Troy Aikman of UCLA. During his junior year, Power completed 72 of 146 passes for 883 yards and threw 2 touchdowns and 7 interceptions. During his senior year, Power was benched in favor of Mark Kamphaus and Willie Hicks. Coach Bicknell did, however, allow Power to start his final college game, a 13–12 loss to Georgia Tech. During his career at Boston College, Power completed 230 of 428 passes for 3,176 yards and threw 12 touchdowns and 20 interceptions. Professional career Power went undrafted in the 1990 NFL draft. He had a tryout with the New England Patriots, but was not signed. He planned on joining Boston College's coaching staff as a graduate assistant, but instead decided to make an attempt at playing professional football and joined the Bay State Titans of the Minor League Football System, a new football league established with some assistance from the NFL as a feeder league for the World League of American Football. Power beat out former UNH starter and 1989 draft pick Bobby Jean for the starting job. In his first play from scrimmage in his first game, Power injured his right rotator cuff. He did not start the next game, but came in during the fourth quarter and completed 8 of 14 attempts for 114 yards. He returned to the starting lineup the following week, but was replaced by former Northeastern quarterback Rich Rodriguez after an ineffective first quarter. Despite this, Power was chosen to start the following week and led the Titans to victory over the Charlotte Barons. It was Charlotte's first defeat in two years. The Titans finished the season 8-2 and finished second in the Eastern Division behind the eventual league champions, the Charlotte Barons. While playing for the Titans, Power also served as a volunteer assistant at Westborough High School, painted houses, and attended graduate school at Boston College. In 1992, Power signed with the Barcelona Dragons of the WLAF, who were coached by Power's former college coach, Jack Bicknell. Later that year, Houston Oilers starting quarterback Warren Moon held out of training camp so the Oilers' General Manager and former Boston College player and coach Mike Holovak signed Power. Power was cut during training camp, but was brought back the following year only to be cut once again. In 1994, Power signed with the Massachusetts Marauders of the Arena Football League.

Purpose The exercise aimed to raise the technical and combat efficiency of the units involved and improve logistics and readiness rates for the implementation of joint security and stability missions in the region, notably Syria. A spokesman for the Arab coalition forces, Ahmad Assiri, said the aim of the exercise is to achieve the highest level of preparedness, exchange expertise and promote coordination among the 21 participating countries. It has also been suggested, considering the forces involved, that the exercise could be the beginning of a land assault on Syria in conjunction with the Turkish Land Forces invading Syria from the north. On 13 February The Independent reported that Saudi troops and fighter aircraft were deploying to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey in preparation for intervention in Syria; however, this could simply indicate a Saudi recommitment to the military intervention against ISIL which was downgraded following the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. Possible direct involvement in the war in Syria has unsettled many Saudis as the war in Yemen appears to be a stalemate and the Saudi economy has been affected by low oil prices. Resources involved According to unofficial sources, around 350,000 soldiers, 2,540 warplanes, 20,000 tanks, and 460 helicopters will participate in the largest military exercise in the history of the region. Jane's Defence Weekly noted that based on official media releases the exercise appeared smaller than Bright Star 2000, which was held in Egypt in 1999 and involved around 73,000 troops from 11 countries. Manoeuvres executed The exercise commenced on 14 February 2016 and concluded on 10 March near King Khaled Military City in northeastern Saudi Arabia, with the participation of various military disciplines of artillery, tanks, and infantry, and air defense systems, naval forces.

Beginning with the 1984 live- action film Ghostbusters written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, the premise and storyline have inspired sequels, spinoffs, and reboots. These entries into the franchise include an ever expanding list of both recurring and original characters. Ghostbusters (1984) =Human characters= Peter Venkman Peter Venkman is a focal member of the Ghostbusters. He is portrayed by Bill Murray in both live action films, and is voiced in the animated series first by Lorenzo Music, followed by Dave Coulier. Peter is one of three doctors of parapsychology on the team; he also holds a PhD in psychology. In the movies, he is characterized by his blunt persona, his laid- back approach to his profession, and his womanizing demeanor; of the three doctors in the Ghostbusters, he is the least committed to the academic and scientific side of their profession, and tends to regard his field, in the words of his employer in the first film, as \\"a dodge or hustle\\". In the first movie, he is shown to develop genuine concern and romantic feelings for the Ghostbusters' first client, Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver). Raymond Stantz Raymond \\"Ray\\" Stantz, another member of the Ghostbusters, is played by Dan Aykroyd in the films Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II, and is voiced by Frank Welker in the animated television series The Real Ghostbusters. He is one of the three doctors of parapsychology on the team and Peter’s closest friends. Ray is considered the \\"heart\\" of the Ghostbusters by the other members of the team and the second in command. He is an expert on paranormal history and metallurgy. He is characterized by his almost childlike enthusiasm towards his work, and his outspoken acceptance of paranormal activity. Egon Spengler Egon Spengler is the brains of the Ghostbusters – described in the original script as a \\"New Wave Mr. Spock\\" – and the creator of the Ghostbusters' equipment along with Raymond Stantz. Lacking much of a personality other than his focus on all things scientific, he is often shown as lacking social skills when dealing with people. Egon was portrayed by Harold Ramis in the films Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II, and voiced by Maurice LaMarche in the animated television series The Real Ghostbusters and later Extreme Ghostbusters. LaMarche was the only voice actor to remain for the entirety of both series. Before the movie was released, American Cinematographer described Egon as \\"maniacal\\" based on reading the script. Ramis credited the part as launching his acting career, as up to that point he had been a director and writer, with a smaller acting role alongside Bill Murray in Stripes. Winston Zeddemore Winston Zeddemore is played by Ernie Hudson in both movies and the 2009 video game, and was voiced by Arsenio Hall in the first season of The Real Ghostbusters. Buster Jones provided Winston's voice in the remaining seasons, and he reprised the role in a cameo on Extreme Ghostbusters. Hudson reportedly auditioned to reprise the role of Winston for the animated series, but he was rejected in favor of Hall. Unlike the other members of the team, Winston is not a scientist with a background in the paranormal; the novelization says that he was in the Marines. He is hired when the Ghostbusters' business begins to pick up. Despite not sharing the educational credentials of his coworkers, Winston often serves as the everyman of the team, acting as a voice of reason and displaying more common sense than the others. In the 2009 video game, Winston claims to have spent time in the Egypt exhibit of the museum while in college, suggesting experience in anthropology or a related science. Dana Barrett Portrayed by Sigourney Weaver in the first and second movie, Dana Barrett was a single cellist living at 550 Central Park West (55 Central Park West), a sinister apartment building which would become the gateway for the apocalyptic deity, Gozer the Gozerian. Dana is singled out early for unwelcome paranormal attention by Gozer's minions, and seeks the help of the Ghostbusters after seeing their advertisement on television. She is possessed by the demon Zuul, Gatekeeper of Gozer; who along with Keymaster Vinz Clortho opens the interdimensional gate to summon Gozer to Earth in the first film. She promptly attracts the romantic attention of Venkman, whose flippant behavior causes her to doubt her decision to seek aid from the Ghostbusters. In the sequel five years later, Dana is a divorced mother of an eight-month-old boy named Oscar; Venkman is neither her former husband nor Oscar's father. Dana was then working as a restorationist for the fictitious Manhattan Museum of Art. It is here that she (and later Baby Oscar) comes to the attention of the evil Prince Vigo the Carpathian, whose malign spirit inhabits his massive self portrait. When Dana and Baby Oscar becomes the target of Vigo's plot, the Ghostbusters re-enter her life to save her, Baby Oscar, and the world once more. She was also a neighbor of Louis Tully at 550 Central Park West in the first movie. The two remained acquainted, then became friends. Louis and Janine Melnitz baby-sat Oscar (and became a romantic item) during the second film. Weaver confirmed in June 2019 that she will reprise her role as Barrett in Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021). Dana is the only character that didn't appear in The Real Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters: The Video Game. Janine Melnitz Janine Melnitz, the Ghostbusters's secretary, is played by Annie Potts in both movies, and is voiced by Laura Summer and Kath Soucie in The Real Ghostbusters and Pat Musick in Extreme Ghostbusters. Janine has occasionally worn the Ghostbusters uniform and used ghost-catching equipment in the animated series. During the first film, Janine often flirted with Egon but none of her advances were returned in kind. She later dated Louis Tully in the sequel. Louis Tully Louis Tully is a nerdy accountant and a neighbor of Dana Barrett, played by Rick Moranis in Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II and voiced by Rodger Bumpass in the Slimer! And the Real Ghostbusters animated series. He is possessed by the demon Vinz Clortho, the Keymaster who, along with Zuul, opens the interdimensional gate to bring Gozer to Earth in the first film. In Ghostbusters II, he is revealed to have graduated from night law school, representing the Ghostbusters at their trial and taking up permanent employment with them when they reestablish their business. In addition, he seeks to become the fifth Ghostbuster. He later borrows a Ghostbuster jumpsuit and proton pack to attempt to help defeat Vigo The Carpathian. After the release of Ghostbusters II, Louis became a semi-regular character on Slimer! And the Real Ghostbusters as the Ghostbusters' legal and financial adviser. Ghostbusters, like many films on which Moranis has worked, had him improvising some of his lines. He appears as a non-playable character in Lego Dimensions voiced by Mick Wingert. In his sidequest on the Ghostbusters Adventure World, he requires the player's help to get more guests for his party. =Supernatural Entities= Slimer Slimer is a translucent green blob creature, with two skinny arms, no feet, and several chins. In the first movie, Slimer was voiced by director Reitman, while Welker voiced the green ghost in The Real Ghostbusters. Slimer originally was a priest that led the circumcisions in the Anglican Methodist church when killed by one of his patients he vowed to haunt New York forever. In the 1989 sequel Ghostbusters II, Robin Shelby performed Slimer and Reitman again voiced Slimer but most of the footage shot was not used. In the late 1990s cartoon Extreme Ghostbusters, Slimer's voice was provided by Billy West. Troy Baker voices Slimer in the 2009 video game, though with the sound effects used in the first movie. Aykroyd reportedly referred to Slimer as \\"The Ghost of John Belushi\\". In the script for Ghostbusters, Slimer is never called by any name. He is described by Dr. Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) as an \\"Ugly Little Spud,\\" just before he slimes Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray). In Ghostbusters terminology, Slimer is designated as a \\"Focused, Non-Terminal Repeating Phantasm or a Class 5 Full- Roaming Vapor! (Real nasty one, too!)\\" The creature's original title was \\"The Onionhead Ghost\\", which the film crew dubbed him for the horrible odor he used to scare a couple in a scene cut from the original movie. Slimer's personality is one of tremendous gluttony, and he is referred to as a \\"disgusting blob\\". In the movies, he is not named and makes short appearances. In the cartoon, he is known as Slimer, is able to speak, and demonstrates a child's intelligence and intense loyalty to Peter and the Ghostbusters with the personality of a dog. His role in the series is explained in the episode \\"Citizen Ghost\\", which primarily consists of a flashback to the immediate aftermath of the movie, where Slimer returned to the firehouse as the Ghostbusters were the first people to show any interest in him, the team 'adopting' him as a means of testing ghosts and an ally after he helped them defeat ectoplasmic manifestations of themselves that had manifested from their old uniforms after the uniforms were exposed to ghostly energies from the containment unit. In the Marvel UK comics of the Real Ghostbusters, Slimer had his own half-page sketch, in which Slimer's past life was covered; he was originally called King Remils (\\"Slimer\\" spelled backwards), a greedy, obese monarch who had died of heart failure. Slimer's popularity soared from the subsequent spin-off animated television series The Real Ghostbusters. Slimer later starred in his own Slimer! cartoons when The Real Ghostbusters was extended to a one-hour format. SLIMER! was briefly published by NOW Comics, a defunct Chicago firm. Artists included Mitch O'Connell and Mark Braun. Writers included Larry Parr who also wrote for the animated series. Slimer also appeared as a representative of The Real Ghostbusters in the animated anti-drug television special Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue. Slimer was also the mascot for the Hi-C flavor \\"Ecto Cooler\\", which came out shortly after The Real Ghostbusters, and was colored green. Slimer remained on the box well after the Real Ghostbusters was cancelled; but in 1997 the drink was renamed \\"Shoutin' Orange Tangergreen\\", and Slimer was removed. Slimer also had a toothpaste named after him. A more monstrous and \\"evil-looking\\" incarnation of Slimer appears in the 2016 reboot, as voiced by Adam Ray: it appears in the ghost havoc scenes, as it ravages a hot dog cart, but, as the Ghostbusters near to investigate, he steals the Ecto-1 and starts joyriding with other ghosts (including a Lady Slimer) around Manhattan, but the Ghostbusters decide not to shoot him, as the car contains a nuclear reactor. Later, they actually do shoot at the car to use the reactor to reverse the effects of the ghost portal, with Slimer and Lady Slimer sharing a kiss before falling inside it. The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man – mascot for the fictional Stay-Puft Marshmallows company – became the chosen Destructor form of Gozer ( towering roughly 112.5\\" feet tall ) after Dr. Ray Stantz \\"tried to think of the most harmless thing. Something I loved from my childhood. Something that could never, ever possibly destroy us... Mr. Stay-Puft...\\" Stay-Puft also makes appearances in the animated series The Real Ghostbusters (most times friendly due to not being possessed by Gozer any longer, other times a bit cranky), and returns as a boss – the resurrected Destructor avatar sans Gozer – in Ghostbusters: The Video Game. Stay-Puft was inspired by Peter O'Boyle, a security guard at Columbia Pictures whom director Reitman met filming his previous movie, Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone. According to Sam Delaney of The Guardian, \\"Stay-Puft's familiar mascot combined elements of real life brand ambassadors Bibendum (aka the Michelin tire man) and the Pillsbury Dough Boy.\\" The costume was created by Bill Bryan using miniatures, optical compositing and Bryan himself in a latex suit. Gozer The Gozerian Gozer The Gozerian, also known as \\"The Destructor\\", \\"The Destroyer,\\" \\"Volguus Zildrohar,\\" \\"Lord of The Sebouillia,\\" \\"Scourge of the Glethestements\\" and \\"The Traveler;\\" a genderless, sadistic, shapeshifting, apocalyptic, cosmic entity (worshipped as a god by the Hittite, Mesopotamian and Sumerian cultures) who appears as the first film's main antagonist. In Ghostbusters terminology from West End Games' role-playing game, Gozer would be a Class 7 Metaspectre. Gozer never appeared in The Real Ghostbusters animated series and it never gave a classification for It ( the 1984 film did not classify Gozer either, apart from indicating It was a god ). However, Gozer is referred to several times and described by Ray Stantz as a \\"Primal God\\" in the episode, \\"Janine Melnitz, Ghostbuster.\\" Gozer was also used as a benchmark for other potent entities encountered, such as Proteus, Nexxa, Murray The Mantis and Great Cthulhu. Gozer Itself is reputed ( with very few exceptions, such as Cthulhu ) to be the most powerful being the Ghostbusters have ever faced. It displayed an extraordinary array of abilities including dimensional travel, shape-changing, telepathy, great agility and stamina, energy attacks (casting lightning bolts), invisibility, intangibility, pyrokinesis, teleportation and weather control. In fact, Its mere entering and presence within Earth's dimension caused increases in paranormal activity and the disruption of natural forces (the storm clouds and earthquakes before/during the battle with the Ghostbusters). Gozer proved so powerful, that the Ghostbusters had to resort to crossing the streams, using Total Protonic Reversal to destroy the portal and hurl Gozer and Its minions back their own universe. As briefly mentioned in the film and fully covered by the 2009 game sequel, cults worshipping Gozer and Its minions arose around 6000 BC before being banished by the Babylonian goddess Tiamat following a protracted conflict between their followers. Via Its chief minions – Terror Dogs Zuul The Gatekeeper and Vinz Clortho The Keymaster, Gozer can escape to other realities. Upon entering a given dimension – as a profane form of granting a last request, Gozer demands of those who witness its arrival to \\"CHOOSE THE FORM OF THE DESTRUCTOR,\\" a physical avatar It will manifest as to destroy that plane of existence. In the 1920s, cult leader Ivo Shandor and his followers set Gozer's Coming in motion, eventually happening as the \\"Manhattan Crossrip of 1984,\\" when Its minions Zuul and Vinz Clortho opened the portal for It to emerge from the rooftop temple of 550 Central Park West (55 Central Park West). Though initially appearing in the form of an androgynous humanoid woman, Gozer uses Ray's accidental thought to assume its Destructor form of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man before later being banished back to its hellish realm. Gozer \\"reappears\\" in the 2009 game via the Gozerian Mandala-revived form of Mr. Stay Puft. Without an actual portal to Gozer's domain, this Stay- Puft was a hollow avatar; comparatively weak and requiring far more power to become the true Destructor form it was supposed to be. Because of that, the Ghostbusters managed to defeat It a second time. Later in the story, a disillusioned Ivo Shandor (possessing the mayor of New York) confronted the Ghostbusters. He produced a facsimile of the skull of Gozer's female humanoid form, angrily renounced his faith in The Traveler and contemptuously discarded it. Yet even with this second defeat, the menace of Gozer is far from over. The Destructor still awaits in Its universe for another opportunity to unleash Its wrath. Gozer is best known for Its phrases and quotes such as \\"Are you a god?\\" (Ray: \\"No...\\") \\"Then... DIE!!!\\" (blasts the Ghostbusters with lightning) or its disembodied voice saying \\"THE TRAVELER HAS COME!\\" and \\"CHOOSE AND PERISH!\\" Gozer was played by Yugoslav actress / model Slavitza Jovan and Its demonic voice was provided by Paddi Edwards. The Terror Dogs: Zuul The Gatekeeper and Vinz Clortho The Keymaster Zuul and Vinz Clortho are the primary servants and harbingers of Gozer The Gozerian. Worshipped as demigods, they are known respectively as The Gatekeeper and The Keymaster. Their goal: possess a mortal male and female, perform a sexual rite combining their powers and open a gateway to allow The Destructor entry into a given world. After opening the portal, they take their places as guardians of Gozer's cosmic pyramid. The Terror Dogs are similar in appearance: horned (the male Vinz Clortho has longer horns) dog-like quadrupeds with powerful, dark-colored bodies, blazing demonic red eyes and vicious fangs and claws. In Ghostbusters terminology from West End Games' role-playing game, The Terror Dogs would each rank as a Class 7 Metaspectre. In addition to their ability to dematerialize and possess mortals, The Terror Dogs exhibit other supernatural powers such as summoning lesser entities, levitating, telekinesis and shape-changing (usually the physical form of those they possess into their own horrific forms). Atop 550 Central Park West (55 Central Park West), The Gozerian Temple featured twin gargoyles of The Gatekeeper and Keymaster, within which they manifested and emerged from during a colossal thunderstorm shortly before the \\"Manhattan Crossrip of 1984.\\" They quickly tracked down and possessed their chosen mortal \\"fleshbags,\\" specifically Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) and Louis Tully (Rick Moranis). Eventually, Vinz Clortho reunited with Zuul after waiting 8,000 years. The two kissed passionately, then proceeded to the rooftop shrine to worship Gozer, perform the rite and summon their dark master. When Gozer appeared, it proceeded to lovingly pet them, when It was interrupted by the Ghostbusters' arrival. When the Ghostbusters finally resorted to crossing the streams, The Terror Dogs where hurled back along with Gozer to their hellish realm. And there they await for yet another chance to fulfill their unending goal of unleashing The Destructor once more. The Grey Lady Dr. Eleanor Twitty a.k.a. The Grey Lady or \\"The Library Ghost\\" is the first ghost encountered by the original three Ghostbusters (Ray, Egon, and Peter) while they are investigating paranormal activity at the New York Public Library. When they attempt to touch her, she transforms into a much larger and more frightening skeletal form, and causes the trio to flee the library in terror. Though they do not catch her, they get a scan of her and use the information to construct their containment grid and ghost catching equipment, allowing the creation of their ghost-catching business. In Ghostbusters terminology from West End Games' role-playing game, The Grey Lady would be a Class 4 Free- Floating, Full-Torso, Vaporous Apparition, as she was human in appearance and later identified by the Ghostbusters. She returns in the 2009 video game, where much of her history is revealed, and the Ghostbusters uncover the tragic story of her death. She was once Dr. Eleanor Twitty, the head librarian of the New York Public Library in the 1920s, and overseer of its collection of ancient artifacts, stone tablets, long-forgotten tomes, and rare books. In March 1924, she goes missing, and the police are unable to find her. They discover that she has been murdered by philologist Edmund Hoover, The Collector, who seduces her to get to the rare books in her care, specifically the Gozerian Codex. In the video game, the Ghostbusters discover her reading the Codex before capturing her. Due to the ease of the capture, they state that she must have wanted them to recover the Codex to aid them in defeating the Collector. Ivo Shandor Ivo Shandor, an insane physician and an architect of some renown during the early 20th century with a penchant for performing macabre and unnecessary surgeries, is mentioned in the first film and features in the 2009 video game. The aftermath of the first World War convinced Shandor that humanity is beyond saving. He set up a cult of Gozer worshippers with close to a thousand followers, in the 1920s with his ancestral island home on the Hudson River as the center of it. Using his connections to International Steel's chairman and other corrupt company owners, Shandor designed 550 Central Park West (55 Central Park West) as a means to summon Gozer to bring about the end of the world. Other necessary materials for the apartment building's arcane construction were obtained by Shandor when a mining operation was established in Summerville, Oklahoma in 1927. Shandor also developed a mandala across the city, with the New York Public Library, the Museum of Natural History, the Sedgewick Hotel, and Shandor Island (before it sank) as key nodes protected by his most loyal followers: Azetlor the Collector, the Museum chairman, the Spider Witch, and a captured, otherworldly sloar that generates a steady stream of black slime used to power the Mandala system and Shandor's island lab. Shandor's original scheme comes to fruition during the events of the first film in the 1980s, when the sufficient energy collected causes Gozer's minions to physically manifest in preparation for their master's coming. The Ghostbusters foil Gozer's entry and neutralize it. As revealed in the video game, Shandor is also responsible for the events of Ghostbusters II, as the Psychomagnotheric \\"Mood\\" Slime produced on his island finds its way into an abandoned city subway line, causing a wave of ghosts to surface and strengthening the spirit of Vigo The Carpathian. Shandor finally makes an appearance in Ghostbusters: The Video Game as a main antagonist of the game. By 1991, Shandor possesses the body of Mayor Jack Mulligan and makes Peck head of PCOC to hinder the Ghostbusters, while he uses his only living descendant – Dr. Ilyssa Selwyn – to invoke the nodes of his mandala and revive Gozer's Mr. Stay-Puft Destructor form. Without the actual presence of Gozer, the weaker Marshmallow Man was defeated by the Ghostbusters and failed to capture Ilyssa. Shandor mistakenly becomes further disillusioned of Gozer, and decides to use the mandala to merge the ghost world with the real world in order to become a god himself. Declaring himself \\"The Architect,\\" Shandor took on the form similar to a massive demon covered in molten rock. The Ghostbusters defeat Shandor once and for all by crossing the streams after following him into the ghost world. The Ghostbusters script lists the spelling of the surname as Sandor, which is pronounced \\"shandor\\" and in fact is spelled Šandor as a moderately common Croatian surname. Ghostbusters II (1989) =Human Characters= Oscar Barrett Oscar Barrett (played by William T. Deutschendorf and Hank J. Deutschendorf II) is Dana Barrett's baby boy, born 8 months prior to the beginning of Ghostbusters II. He is nearly sacrificed to serve as a new earthly incarnation of Vigo the Carpathian, but is saved by the Ghostbusters. There has been speculation as to who Oscar's father actually is. Sigourney Weaver – on the June 14, 1989 episode of \\"The Arsenio Hall Show\\" – recalled she thought the father was the Violinist from the Lincoln Center scene. Referred to by Venkman as \\"The Stiff,\\" the Violinist is given the name \\"Andre Wallance\\" in the novelization of the 1984 movie, 'Ghostbusters: The Supernatural Spectacular.' On the 1999 Ghostbusters DVD commentary track, both Joe Medjuck and Ivan Reitman state that Oscar's father is the Violinist. However, in July 2016, Ivan Reitman changed his opinion to Oscar's father probably being Peter Venkman ( Bill Murray ). Peter says to Oscar in their first scene together, \\"You know, I... I should have been your father. I mean, I could have been...\\" Janosz Poha Dr. Janosz Poha (played by Peter MacNicol) is Dana Barrett's boss at the fictional Manhattan Museum of Art. He is somewhat nerdy and harbours a hopeless love interest in her. Dr. Poha is later enslaved by Vigo the Carpathian to bring Dana's baby Oscar to serve as a new vessel for Vigo's evil spirit. However, Vigo's plan for reanimation is stopped by the Ghostbusters, who also manage to free Dr. Poha from Vigo's spell. =Supernatural Entities= Vigo The Carpathian Vigo The Carpathian (full name: \\"Prince Vigo von Homburg Deutschendorf\\") (Wilhelm von Homburg) appears in the second film as the main antagonist. Known as a powerful magician, genius, lunatic, and genocidal madman, Vigo was a sadistic, power-hungry 16th/17th Century tyrant of Carpathia. Self-described as the \\"Scourge of Carpathia\\" and \\"the Sorrow of Moldavia,\\" Vigo's unfortunate subjects gave him other titles: Vigo The Cruel, Vigo The Torturer, Vigo The Despised and Vigo The Unholy. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) – upon hearing all these unflattering titles – cynically commented, \\"Wasn't he also 'Vigo The Butch?'\\" Born in 1505, Vigo was an expert in sorcery and black magic, enabling him with an unnaturally long life span. It came to an equally unnatural end when in the year 1610, he was \\"poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.\\" In spite of all that, as Ray Stantz ( Dan Aykroyd ) notes about Vigo, \\"just before his head died, his last words were, 'Death is but a Door; Time is but a Window... I'll be back!'\\" Vigo was based on Vlad the Impaler (the inspiration for Dracula by Bram Stoker), and in part on Grigori Rasputin, who also survived several attempts on his life. In addition to The Dark Arts, Vigo was also skilled in painting. And it was a combination of the two that provided him with the means to remain within the mortal realm after death. Vigo's spirit possesses and remains within his life- size self portrait, which inevitably arrives at the restoration department of the fictitious Manhattan Museum of Art in 1989 ( the setting for the Ghostbusters II ). In Ghostbusters terminology from West End Games' role- playing game, Vigo would be a Class 4 Full-Torso Apparition, as he was human in appearance and identified easily. However as the events of Ghostbusters II progressed, Vigo drew strength from the negatively-charged rivers of Psychomagnotheric \\"Mood\\" Slime flowing beneath Manhattan. In doing so, his potency increased to the comparable levels of a Class 7 entity. With his new found power, Vigo manipulates art gallery curator Dr. Janosz Poha (Peter MacNicol) into finding a child (Dana's son Oscar) whose body he can permanently inhabit. His plan is foiled by the Ghostbusters' use of positive mood slime, disrupting his attempts to possess Oscar. After briefly possessing Ray Stantz, Vigo is trapped within his painting once and for all. In Ghostbusters: The Video Game, the portrait of Vigo is stored in the Ghostbusters' firehouse. Though no longer a threat, Vigo enjoys insulting and taunting anybody who approaches him. He also makes cryptic predictions based on real-world history, as the game's release post-dates the time period of the game by nearly two decades. Vigo's full name is a combination of the stage name of Norbert Grupe (aka Wilhelm von Homburg), who played Vigo, and William and Henry Deutschendorf, the twins that played the baby Oscar. The menacing voice of Vigo was provided by Max von Sydow. The Scoleri Brothers Nunzio and Tony Scoleri were convicted murderers sentenced to death by electric chair by Judge Stephen \\"The Hammer\\" Wexler. They later return as electrified ghosts when Judge Wexler was trying the Ghostbusters in court. Extreme Ghostbusters (1997) =Eduardo Rivera= Eduardo Rivera (voiced by Rino Romano) was first introduced as one of the next generation of Ghostbusters in Extreme Ghostbusters. He seemingly a lazy, sarcastic and somewhat clueless character, Eduardo nevertheless makes himself an integral part of the team by being determined and reliable. Eduardo, along with Garrett, resembles original Ghostbuster Peter Venkman in that, like Venkman, Eduardo is sarcastic, has a penchant for pursuing attractive women, and is generally unscientific and constantly spouts pop culture references. He also reads \\"J.N. Kline\\" young-adult horror novels. Eduardo has a long-running subplot dealing with a love/hate relationship between him and Kylie, although it is very much revealed \\"In Your Dreams\\" that he has intimate feelings and dreams about her. These feelings are further enforced in that he is usually the one to rescue Kylie from dangerous situations, and vice versa, in several episodes. He once said to Kylie herself that nothing was going to happen to her \\"while [he's] around\\". In fact, in the episode \\"Darkness at Noon\\" he outright admitted to Kylie, who was possessed by a ghost at the time, that he felt an attraction of sorts when he saw her for the first time and even showed the intention of kissing her when Kylie asked him to. In \\"The Unseen\\" he takes the rap for Kylie's mistake, not wanting \\"the worst day of her life to get any worse\\". In \\"Rage\\", Eduardo reveals to have an older brother, Carlos \\"Carl\\" Rivera, an NYPD officer who is angry with Eduardo for not being a police officer like the rest of their family, and thinks the Ghostbuster are a scam, which is why Eduardo kept his job a secret. In the same episode it is also implied that his father is dead (or at least retired) as he and Carlos refer to him in the past tense during a heated argument. In \\"Fear Itself\\", it is revealed that Eduardo has a fear of death (specifically his own). He has a vicious rivalry with Slimer, but has ended up working with the ghost, and volunteered to save him in \\"Slimer's Sacrifice\\". He also has an on the surface rivalry with Garrett with the two often mocking each other and attempting to one up the other. In spite of this as the series goes on the two seem to have the closest thing to a friendship even though Garrett's enthusiastic personality completely contrasts Eduardo's cynical attitude. (The official website claimed he slacks off due to fear of failure.) Despite all his cynicism and slacking he demonstrates a reasonably high level of intelligence as in the episode \\"Eyes of a Dragon\\" he states how the proton aspect of light works to Kylie and later on how to defeat the ghost of that episode. Eduardo was also the one to smash a cursed orb, causing the eye-stealing ghost to disintegrate in the episode \\"The Unseen\\" and also continued the incantation that destroyed the demon of an alternate dimension in which he, Roland and Kylie were imprisoned in the episode \\"Casting the Runes\\". Eduardo has also exhibited bouts of jealousy whenever Kylie seemingly flirts with other men and in \\"Till Death Do Us Start\\" he showed signs of sheepish nervousness when asked if he and Kylie were together. =Kylie Griffin= Kylie Griffin (voiced by Tara Charendoff) was first introduced as one of the next generation of Ghostbusters in Extreme Ghostbusters. She is appointed by the group to carry the ghost trap on her back. She becomes involved with the Ghostbusters after enrolling in Egon Spengler's course at City College of New York. Kylie shares certain traits with Egon, such as knowledge of the supernatural. Both are eccentric and socially awkward and they both had encounters with supernatural beings from their childhood (Egon met the Boogeyman and Kylie's friend was taken by the Grundel). As part of Extreme Ghostbusters, Kylie is featured in the video games Extreme Ghostbusters for the Game Boy Color, Extreme Ghostbusters: Code Ecto-1 for Game Boy Advance and Extreme Ghostbusters: The Ultimate Invasion for the PlayStation. She was also the basis of several action figures from Trendmasters. Kylie is widely regarded as the fan favorite of Extreme Ghostbusters. Kylie reappears as a supporting character in IDW Publishing's Ghostbusters comic. She first appears in issue 5 in 2012 as the manager of Ray Stantz's occult book shop. In November 2012, it was announced that Kylie would be made an official Ghostbuster in issues beginning in February 2013. = Roland Jackson = Roland Jackson (voiced by Alfonso Ribeiro) was first introduced as one of the next generation of Ghostbusters in Extreme Ghostbusters. He the mechanic of the group. Roland is the most level- headed and mechanically-gifted of the new Ghostbusters, helping Egon repair and improve the Proton Packs and Ecto-1; his reason for joining Egon's class was seeing the Ecto-1 at an auto show. Roland approaches the paranormal from a practical point-of-view, and in the episode \\"Fear Itself\\" reveals that his only fear is the dangerous breakdown of his equipment. In \\"The Infernal Machine\\", he became disgruntled that his technological efforts were being taken for granted. Roland's strongest wish is to get into the Ivy League and become a doctor. He's a very staid, square personality, slow to anger, though he came close to striking one of the racists in \\"The True Face of the Monster\\"; it is implied he has had to deal with racist attitudes before. Roland has twice come under the mental control of villains, the Siren in \\"Sonic Youth\\" and Luko in \\"The Infernal Machine\\". \\"Grease\\" reveals Roland is the oldest in a lower-middle-class family and volunteers for the Little League and helps the homeless; in \\"Grundelesque\\" we meet his very mischievous younger brother whom Roland (at first) refuses to believe is a troublemaker. Like Winston, Roland is the only African American member of the team, yet he has a talent with machines like Ray. = Garrett Miller = Garrett Miller (voiced by Jason Marsden) was first introduced as one of the next generation of Ghostbusters in Extreme Ghostbusters. Garrett is a lifelong wheelchair user, has a very 'jock'-like attitude and is a huge fan of extreme sports and attempting mad stunts. In the episode \\"Grease\\", it is revealed that Garrett was born with the inability to walk and studying to be a physical therapist, and throughout the series he only refers to his condition to mock it (and in \\"Be Careful What You Wish For\\", uses it as an excuse to dump some work on Eduardo). He is the most headstrong and enthusiastic of the new Ghostbusters, often claiming that he is in it only for the adrenaline rush; he was left bitterly disappointed in \\"Ghost Apocalyptic Future\\" to learn he was the only Ghostbuster not remembered in the future dystopia. While he studies to be a physical therapist to help other disabled people, his secret dream is to be an NBA star. In \\"Fear Itself\\", it is revealed that Garrett is claustrophobic (though he never admits it to anyone), and has a deep disdain towards the FBI ever since the incident where two agents arrested them under the belief they were causing the sabotages and released a gremlin they recently captured while they were on a plane. He has a rivalry with Eduardo, the two of them constantly bantering and trying to one-up each other. In \\"Deadliners\\", we find out Garrett wrote a (bad) horror story starring himself (the other Ghostbusters died on the first page, to their annoyance). Like Ray, Garrett is the most enthusiastic. Garrett is the only Ghostbuster in the history of the franchise never to be made as a toy (all other Ghostbusters received at least two toys, including Louis and Janine), presumably due to the implausibility of having the wheelchair as a separate assembling piece. Though a prototype figure was made. Bob Higgins has said that during a focus group of young children, the creators found Garrett was the most popular character: \\"when we asked... which of these characters would you want to be and they all wanted to be Garrett, they all wanted to be the guy that does the crazy things. They all wanted to be the guy that was the leader and they all kind of saw him as the leader of this group [even though he wasn't]\\". Ghostbusters (2016) =Human characters= Erin Gilbert Dr. Erin Gilbert in the 2016 film, played by Kristen Wiig, is Abby Yates' second-in-command. She is introduced as an assistant physics professor at Columbia University, but her bid for tenure fails after her previous research into the paranormal with Abby comes to light. She has long since dismissed her belief in ghosts, but regains it after being slimed by Gertrude Aldridge during a face-to-face encounter. In the novelization, she is depicted as having grown up near Battle Creek, Michigan; she met Abby in her senior year of high school, and spent much of her time at the University of Michigan researching ghosts with Abby. She did postgraduate work at Princeton University, and got her doctorate at MIT. She shares traits with Peter Venkman as both kept getting slimed, they are also team leaders with a sense of humor and attraction to the opposite gender. Abby Yates Dr. Abigail L. \\"Abby\\" Yates is portrayed by Melissa McCarthy in the 2016 film, and is the Ghostbusters' de facto leader. In the novelization, she transferred to Erin's high school after moving from Indiana in her senior year. The two became fast friends, and spent their college years at the University of Michigan researching ghosts. They collaborated on a book about their findings, but Erin backed out of a planned interview after her graduate advisor at Princeton panned the project. Undaunted, she moved to New York City to continue her research. In the film, she rereleases her book without Erin's consent, threatening her bid for tenure. When Erin demands to have the book taken down, Abby complies, in exchange for her participation at a ghost investigation with Holtzmann at the Aldridge Mansion Museum. She shares traits to Ray Stantz for both are sometimes get possessed, and they both have the same enthusiasm and talent for invention. Jillian Holtzmann Dr. Jillian \\"Holtz\\" Holtzmann is portrayed by Kate McKinnon in the 2016 film. A nuclear engineer by training, she is introduced as Abby's research partner and becomes the team's equipment designer, constructing their proton packs as well as a range of auxiliary weapons. She is hinted to have a romantic interest in Erin, as seen in an alternate ending scene where she claims that they are dating, as well as several other instances of flirting throughout the film. Her mentor is Dr. Rebecca Gorin (Sigourney Weaver). In the novelization, it is revealed that she narrowly missed being admitted to CERN. Several of her peers in school started calling her by her last name because \\"Jillian\\" sounded too feminine, and by the time of the film she almost never answers to her first name. She shares traits with Egon Spengler for both are intelligent and tend to do strange things. Director Paul Feig confirmed in an interview with The Daily Beast that Holtzmann was supposed to be a lesbian, or somewhere on the LGBT+ spectrum, but the studio refused to allow that detail into the movie and instead left the audience with the freedom of more personal interpretation of her character. She was also observed by some viewers to depict autistic traits, or more specifically, someone with Asperger syndrome.http://fusion.net/story/350298/ghostbusters-holtzmann-kate-mckinnon- queer-autism/ Patty Tolan Patricia \\"Patty\\" Tolan is portrayed by Leslie Jones in the 2016 film. She works for the New York MTA as a subway booth attendant, and is the only member of Abby's team who does not have an advanced degree. She is however, a big fan of non-fiction and is a municipal historian with intense knowledge of New York's history. After contacting them to report a ghost sighting in one of the tunnels, she joins the team and borrows a hearse from her uncle's funeral home that is eventually converted into Ecto-1, a vehicle for personnel and equipment transport. She shares traits with Winston Zeddemore as both believe in the supernatural without being scientists, and also both are African American. Kevin Beckman Kevin Beckman is a receptionist in the office building of the Ghostbusters team in 2016 film, played by Chris Hemsworth. He serves as the male counterpart to Janine Melnitz from the first two films. In the film, he applies for job in office building where the Erin and her mates are establishing ghost and supernatural business headquarters. They are skeptical to hire him for being silly and bit dumb, but he gets the job as he is seen as a nice, calm guy. Kevin sometimes provides jokes and statements to the team throughout the film. Later he becomes possessed by the spirit of Rowan North who uses him as a host and goes to Mercado Hotel to activate the device to unleash the ghost army in New York City. The Ghostbusters arrive in the building to save him and Rowan discards him but the girls catch him when Kevin falls down to the floor. After repelling Rowan's invasion, Kevin is back in his job as the girls see him as a valuable worker in their business. Rowan North Rowan North is an occultist and a former employee of the Mercado Hotel in the 2016 film as the main antagonist, portrayed by Neil Casey. In the film, he left his former job and became an occultist because he felt his life became miserable when he was mistreated in own life. Obsessed with the supernatural, Rowan attempted to unleash the ghost army in New York City by putting devices across the city connected to main machine in the Mercado Hotel in Times Square, as a former site of paranormal history, along with Ley lines within the New York area to activate the portal and create the vortex between the two worlds. Rowan also used the book called \\"Ghost From Our Past\\", written by Erin Gilbert and Abby Yates as inspiration for his plans. When the Ghostbusters discovered his plans, he planned to turned it on, but as the police arrived, he committed suicide. However, as the Ghostbusters later discovered, he had planned all along to commit suicide, so he could become a ghost. Rowan possessed Abby briefly, then Kevin Beckman as host to get to the Mercado hotel and activate the portal machine, resulting in the unleashing of the ghosts in New York. When the Ghostbusters arrived, Rowan discarded the host and transformed into the Ghostbusters logo, a demonic gigantic version of the cartoon ghost. When the girls destroyed the vortex, he was pulled into the ghost dimension, but caught Abby, trying to kill her. Erin entered the dimension and saved her, while Rowan was disintegrated in that dimension, ending his invasion. =Ghosts= Gertrude Aldridge Gertrude Aldridge was the first ghost seen by Erin, Abby and Holtzmann in the 2016 film. She was portrayed by Bess Rous. Gertrude Aldridge was the horribly disturbed daughter of a wealthy New York aristocrat who was responsible for the murder of the family's servants. As a result, she spent the rest of her life locked away in her family manor's basement instead of being turned over to the police, being occasionally fed food through a small slot in the door. In the present day, she haunts the Aldridge Mansion Museum when Tour Guide Garrett (Zach Woods) was about to head home. As soon as Garrett heard her banging on the basement door, he attempted to run out, but the doorknob was red hot. He later attempts to throw a chair to the window, but the chair floats and hit him instead. After going through the basement door and down the stairs, he discovers some green slime on the basement floor, then noticed he got some on his hands. He runs up the stairs to the door, but they collapsed, leaving him clinging on for dear life. Gertrude later reveals herself from the slime on the floor, with Garrett screaming in terror. While Abby and the group were inspecting the mansion, her ghost appears from the basement door, moving towards the group. When Erin tries to communicate with her, Gertrude suddenly transmogrifies and projects ectoplasmic vomit on Erin, then escapes out of a wall and into the streets. During Rowan's invasion of New York City, the team, calling themselves \\"Ghostbusters\\" encounter her again, alongside the Electrocuted Ghost found in the subway and Mayhem. She participates in the battle by picking Erin up off the ground and throwing her to a nearby pilgrim ghost. She later attempts to attack Erin again with \\"Sparky\\", but they end up getting knocked back by a proton shotgun blast. Electrocuted Ghost The Electrocuted Ghost (not to be confused with the Scoleri brothers of the 1989 film), also known as \\"Sparky\\", is the second ghost Erin, Abby and Holtzmann spotted. It is implied that he is the ghost of a criminal executed by the electric chair. He is portrayed by Dave Allen. Shortly after Rowan North (Neil Casey) gave his train ticket to Patty Tolan, he disappeared onto the tracks, causing Patty to go tell him to get out. Instead of finding him, she finds a device on the tracks. The device then opens, revealing the Electrocuted Ghost, causing Patty to flee. Later, the team arrive with Patty and after inspecting the tracks for a bit, Sparky appears. The team decides to test their new proton lasers on him, but the first attempt did not have enough power to even reach the ghost. After being caught in the second attempt, a train later hits Sparky, nearly killing the group as well. Patty then states he will be the third scariest thing on the train. The Ghostbusters encounter \\"Sparky\\" again, alongside Gertrude Aldridge and Mayhem during the Battle for New York. He joins Gertrude Aldridge in trying to attack Erin, but they get knocked back by a proton shotgun blast, which caused him to disintegrate. Ghostbusters: Afterlife (2021) =Human Characters= Phoebe Spengler Phoebe Spengler is portrayed by Mckenna Grace in Ghostbusters: Afterlife. Phoebe is the youngest grandchild of founding Ghostbusters member Dr. Egon Spengler ( Harold Ramis ). She is science-loving, intelligent, resourceful, inquisitive; and bears a resemblance to her grandfather. Due to financial troubles and eviction, Phoebe travels with her mother Callie and older brother Trevor to Summerville, Oklahoma to begin anew at the farmhouse left to them by the now deceased Egon. It is here that she discovers a hidden Ghost Trap in the farmhouse and her special lineage and connection with the original Ghostbusters team. Trevor Spengler Trevor Spengler is portrayed by Finn Wolfhard in Ghostbusters: Afterlife. Trevor is the eldest grandchild of founding Ghostbusters member Dr. Egon Spengler ( Harold Ramis ). A motorhead, he loves cars and has a gift for auto mechanics. He finds and eventually restores the Ghostbusters official vehicle, ECTO-1. Like his sister, Trevor bears a resemblance to their grandfather. At the same time, he adjusts to their new life in Summerville, Oklahoma, meeting locals his age as supernatural phenomena begins to occur. Callie Spengler Callie Spengler is portrayed by Carrie Coon in Ghostbusters: Afterlife. Struggling to make ends meet ( even giving her children haircuts herself to save money ), Callie is eventually evicted from her apartment due to delinquent rent payments. But she receives news that a farmhouse in Summerville, Oklahoma was left to her following the death of Dr. Egon Spengler ( Harold Ramis ). At the time of this writing, it is unclear as to whether Callie is Egon's daughter or daughter-in-law, as well as who was the father of Trevor and Phoebe. Equally unclear is who were the other grandparents. Ghostbusters fans are hoping Janine Melnitz ( Annie Potts ) will be one of the kids' grandmothers, presumably having married Egon. Time will tell. Mr. Grooberson Mr. Grooberson is portrayed by Paul Rudd in Ghostbusters: Afterlife. He is Phoebe's science teacher, while also working on a private project of investigating mysterious local earthquakes. There are no geological explanations for the tremors that are affecting Summerville with greater frequency and intensity. When Phoebe brings Grooberson a Ghost Trap she found in the Spengler farmhouse, he assumes it is a replica. When she asks a replica of what, Grooberson informs her and a fellow classmate of its purpose and origin. He plays a news clip on YouTube, showing them footage of the Ghostbusters during what came to be known as the Manhattan Crossrip of 1984. Sheriff Domingo Summerville's Sheriff Domingo is portrayed by Bokeem Woodbine in Ghostbusters: Afterlife. Elton Elton is portrayed by Oliver Cooper in Ghostbusters: Afterlife.

Built on the grounds of the historic Jokake Inn, the resort opened in 1988, a project of financier Charles Keating. The resort has been awarded a AAA Five-Diamond rating. History In 1985 Charles Keating purchased the property at the base of Camelback Mountain, which included the land occupied by the historic Jokake Inn and Elizabeth Arden's Maine Chance Spa. In addition, three other valley facilities also sat on the acreage Keating purchased: the Paradise Inn, the Valley Country Club, and the El Estribo Lodge. As architects, Keating hired the firm of Killingsworth, Stricker, Lindgren, Wilson and Associates, located in Long Beach, California. The spa, the Centre for Well Being, was designed by JGL Associates, out of Vermont. He intended to build a world class resort, envisioning it as \\"the eighth wonder of the world\\". For the construction of the lobby, white marble was imported from Carrera, Italy. Landscape craftsmen from Tonga were brought to Scottsdale to create the tropical landscape surrounding the hotel. The Phoenician was built at a cost of over $300 million. The resort opened for business on October 1, 1988, The hotel initially had 604 rooms, 132 casitas, a VIP suite and a presidential suite. The dome in the hotel's lobby was covered with 24 karat gold, and the cactus garden, which contained over 250 varieties of cacti, was the second largest in the state when it was completed. In addition, the hotel had 9 Steinway grand pianos, which was the largest order in the company's history. Keating's ownership of the resort was short-lived, however, as it was seized when he was indicted in 1989 for his role in the savings and loan crisis. After its seizure, the government briefly ran the resort, during which time it became known colloquially as \\"Club Fed\\". The government sold it shortly after to the Kuwaiti Investment Office. The Kuwaitis had owned 45% of the hotel prior to its seizure by the federal government, and they paid $111.5 million for the remaining 55%. The Kuwaitis sold it to ITT Sheraton in 1994, which was absorbed by the Starwood Hotels group in 1998. In 2010, a new ballroom was added to the property, at a cost of $40 million. Between 2010 and 2012, $80 million in renovations were done to the property, which included the creation of a \\"resort within a resort\\", the Canyon Suites. This unusual feature includes 60 rooms, including 38 suites, and 2 presidential suites. The resort also includes a $25 million art collection. In 2015, the property was purchased from Starwood Hotels & Resorts by Host Hotels & Resorts of Maryland. As of February 2016, the resort contains 643 rooms (including 62 suites), and sits on 250 acres, with eleven restaurants, nine swimming pools, eleven tennis courts (and the only resort in Arizona with four different playing surfaces), and a 27-hole golf course designed by Ted Robinson and Homer Flint. The golf course is rated as a USGA championship course, which consists of three 9-hole courses, each with its own unique character. In the 2000s, the hotel installed a solar array, which helps to supply the energy needs of the property. Awards and accolades In 1994 the hotel was awarded the first of its five- star ratings by the Mobil Travel Guide (now Forbes Travel Guide). Since that award, the hotel has received either a five- or four-star award every year through 2015 (the current award).

The name was one of the British rainbow codes. RP-3 (\\"Three-inch\\") rockets were used successfully for anti-shipping attacks during World War II. Larger unguided rockets were developed at the end of the war, such as the 'Uncle Tom' to meet Operational Requirement OR.1009. This used six of the three-inch rocket motors in a airframe of diameter. Around 1950 the new Sverdlov-class cruisers caused concern in the Royal Navy, over the fear that the Soviet Navy was expanding into a wide-ranging blue water navy. A new weapon, Red Angel, was developed to meet this threat. This was larger than Uncle Tom and had a warhead intended to attack the deck armour of Sverdlovs. A salvo of six hits was thought to be sufficient to disable a Sverdlov. Red Angel was 10 ft 9 in long and 11.25 inch in diameter. Overall weight was with an warhead. Like Uncle Tom it had flip- out rear fins, but Tom's four large fins were replaced by six smaller. It was first deployed on the Westland Wyvern turboprop, but had always been earmarked for the new jet naval strike aircraft developed in response to the Sverdlov threat, the Blackburn Buccaneer. The high-speed Buccaneer was noted for its rotating bomb bay and internal weapons stowage. This could carry four of the Red Angels. Attack targeting from the 3-inch RP onwards had recognised an unusual behaviour: a projectile that entered the water short of the target ship would steer itself upwards on a curving trajectory and travel horizontally. This not only encouraged a more damaging 'wet hit' below the waterline, but it also made targeting easier: the viable target zone on the sea ahead of the target had an apparent height twice that of the hull. All of these unguided rockets suffered from short effective range and Royal Navy policy in OR.1057 was that attacking aircraft should not have to approach closer than . This OR led to weapons that were longer-ranged and guided, such as the late 1940s 'Nozzle' and the later Green Cheese.

He helped black people escape slavery by establishing safe houses, or Underground Railroad stations, on the route from Maryland to Pennsylvania. He purchased the freedom of blacks at slave auctions. He also initiated lawsuits for kidnapped blacks and created a group of vigilantes to prevent blacks from being kidnapped and enslaved. He also returned some kidnapped people from Liberia returned to their home country. The Quaker meetings he attended based upon his residence. As a child, his family was with the Abington Friends Meeting House. After moving to Maryland, he attended the Little Falls Meetinghouse and when he moved to Baltimore, he attended the Baltimore Quaker Meeting. When he died, thousands of people of color followed his casket to its final resting place at a Quaker burial ground. He had ten children. His son Nathan married Martha Ellicott, who wrote the first biography of Benjamin Banneker, the first African American astronomer, and was a founder of Swarthmore College. Early life Tyson was born in Upper Dublin Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, to Esther Shoemaker and Isaac Tyson (1718–1796). They were affiliated with the Abington Friends Meeting House in the same county. His siblings, born after him, were Tacey, Enos, Jacob, Nathan, and Sarah. Elisha, his brother, and his parents moved to Jericho in Maryland. He came from a Quaker family based in Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His great grandfather, the first Tyson ancestor in America, was among the first settlers of Pennsylvania. He was a German who was converted to the Quaker religion by George Fox. Tyson followed William Penn to England, after which he sailed for the colonies and settled near what is now Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He married an English woman, whose father was a settler, and they had sons and daughters. Career In 1772, he set up in the milling business with his brother, buying Bond's Water Mill in Harford County, Maryland. He settled near Little Falls of the Gunpowder River in Jericho. He belonged to the Gunpowder Monthly Meeting. Nine years later, in 1781, he moved to Baltimore. At the close of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), Tyson began investing in real estate, but lost everything but the property suitable for a mill. He borrowed $12,000 to build a mill near what is now Druid Hill Park at Jones Falls. The first year, he had a profit of $20,000. Within several years he was a wealthy man. He was a flour miller, trader, and a merchant. In 1818, he was a founder of the Savings Bank of Baltimore. He allowed the government use one of his mills to make bullets, although he was a pacifist. He believed in temperance and would not allow whiskey to process through his storehouses. Community advocate and activist Due to his religious beliefs, Tyson was a pacifist and was not involved in politics. He was, though, very involved in multi-faceted approaches for assisting oppressed people. He was an emancipator and a philanthropist. =Abolitionist= Elisha was particularly vocal in maintaining the values of the Quakers, often recalling the protest of 1688, which had been the first public protest against the institution of slavery. In 1789, he became one of the founders of the Maryland Society for the Abolition of Slavery, the first abolitionist society in the state. Three years later he became a supporter of the African Academy, which in 1797 opened the first school for free African Americans. =Assisted blacks obtain and maintain their freedom= Tyson was also active in offering practical assistance to fugitives from slavery, providing housing along Falls Road Turnpike to act as safe houses, or Underground Railroad stations, and helping these fugitives make their way to Pennsylvania. He purchased women and men at the slave auction in Baltimore, and set them free. He lobbied for laws to help slaves and blacks, persuaded slaveholders to free slaves, and helped provide schools and churches for freed blacks. He organized vigilante groups, known as the \\"Georgia men\\" to thwart the efforts of men who kidnapped black people—both runaway slaves and free people—and enslaved them. He helped thousands of kidnapped slaves earn their freedom through legal suits. Although he received threats against his life and house, he continued to rescue slaves. He was threatened with a pistol by a slave dealer, Austin Woolfolk, when Tyson intervened as Woolfolk dragged a black woman past his house in Baltimore. Tyson calmly \\"unbuttoned his shirt and exposed his chest. He invited the slave dealer to pull the trigger, telling him that he 'was in hell already though he [Woolfolk] didn't know it.' \\" An investigation revealed that she was a free woman kidnapped by Woolfolk and she was set free. Tyson sought to gain the freedom of slaves that had been captured as a war prize on the sea. Capt. John Chase captured the Brilliante Habanero a Spanish slave ship. He took 14 of the slaves into his crew and sold 28 people in the West Indies during the summer of 1822. He lobbied for their freedom and filed freedom suits on their behalf, but the case was denied. With the help of Charles Carroll, Robert Goodloe Harper, and Dr. Ely Ayres, who was a member of the American Colonization Society, the judge changed his opinion and ordered that the men be release. Chase captured three men, and 11 men were freed. =African colonization= Tyson supported transporting blacks to Africa. He purchases farming equipment and household goods for the colonization of eleven slaves who sailed on the Fidelity for Africa in 1823. Once Tyson, who had been ill, heard that the men made it safely to Liberia, he stated that he was content to die now. =Other= He provided free medical care to the poor when he established the Baltimore General Dispensary. When the Maryland Penitentiary opened in 1811, Tyson, a member of the directors, ensured that the institute did not engage in racial discrimination. About 1810, when he was 60 years of age, he traveled on horseback with his friend George Gillingham to Fort Wayne, Indiana to meet with Native American leaders to better understand their needs and concerns. During the trip, he became ill due to exposure. Personal life He built a mansion on Hanover Street in Baltimore. Soon after its completion, a man offered to pay much more than its value to purchase it. Tyson sold the house to him and built a new one at Sharp Street, between Pratt and Lombard. He bought four houses across from his for his children: Isaac, Nathan, William, and Mary Tyson Clapp. Elisha's house was across the street from a colored meeting house. He owned a summer house on 732 Pacific Street near Falls Road Turnpike, which he helped finance in 1805. Built with two-feet-thick granite, the house is a classic Federal style. He married Mary Amos, daughter of Hannah and William Amos, on November 5, 1776. She wore a gray silk cloak on her wedding day. Like the Amos family, Tyson was a member of the Little Falls Meetinghouse. Five of their eleven children died young. They had Isaac; Esther, who died in childbirth; Lucretia; William; Mary; Nathan; James, who died young; two girls named Sarah, who both died young; Elisha, and Deborah Darby Tyson. His wife, Mary, died on April 17, 1813. He married Margaret Cowman of Anne Arundel County, Maryland on October 22, 1814. They did not have any children. She died on January 29, 1853. His son Nathan married Martha Ellicott, who wrote the first biography of Benjamin Banneker, the first African American astronomer. It was entitled A Sketch of the Life (1854). She was a founder of Swarthmore College. Tyson died on February 16, 1824 in Baltimore. His funeral, one of the largest in the city, saw several thousand or four thousand blacks accompany Tyson's casket to its final resting place at the Friends Burial Ground in Baltimore. An obituary of Tyson in The United States Gazette stated that \\"the wrongs inflicted on Africa's children made a deep and indelible impression on his heart, till its last beat...\\" Before he died, Tyson wrote \\"A Farewell Address by Elisha Tyson of the City of Baltimore to the Colored People of the United States\\", which was published on April 6, 1824 by The United States Gazette .

Gameplay The player uses a joystick to control the eponymous Frantic Freddie, a telephone line engineer. Each level takes place on a single screen, each with five full-width platforms connected by telegraph poles. Freddie runs along the platforms; he cannot pass through the telegraph poles but may climb up and down either side of them. The goal of the game is to collect the pots of gold resting on the platforms, as well as optional bonus items which scroll through the playing area. Each level is patrolled by three to five monstrous \\"Greeblies\\" that Freddie must avoid, lest he lose a life. The game has a total of sixteen playable levels punctuated by animated intermission sequences. The 17th level has a game breaking bug, as this level mistakenly has all poles removed. This means that Freddie can't reach the platforms above him, making this level impossible to clear. The Greeblies, at the top of the screen, have now taken the form of Freddie, and since they can't reach Freddie, because of the missing poles, this is the end of the game. The player is forced to reset/turn off the system. Soundtrack The game's synthesized soundtrack mingles arrangements of popular and ragtime songs: * \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" (Queen) * \\"Boogie Fever\\" (The Sylvers) * \\"The Easy Winners\\" (Scott Joplin) * \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" (Electric Light Orchestra) * \\"Kodachrome\\" (Paul Simon) * \\"A Fifth of Beethoven\\" (Walter Murphy) * \\"Pine Apple Rag\\" (Scott Joplin) * \\"Elite Syncopations\\" (Scott Joplin) * \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (Scott Joplin) * \\"The Sycamore\\" (Scott Joplin) Reception Reviewing a budget release of the game in 1988, Pete Connor of ACE described Frantic Freddie as \\"a pretty tired game\\" that promised only \\"a modicum of fun\\".

Fifty years of common work Roux-Dorlut was born in Puy-en-Velay. In 1946 he formed with Badani a partnership to study the rebuilding of the Languedoc, and that partnership, based on a common architectural training and reinforced by a common regional background, was cemented by more than fifty years of work, struggle and friendship. A \\"partnership\\" suggests reciprocal influence, complementary enrichment, a dialogue in which the naturel inclination of each partner is tempered by that of the other. However, for those who know Roux- Dorlut well, it is possible to discern the impact of the individual personality on their joint achievements. They carry out their professional programs together, but the final embodiment in form often reveals the dominant influence of one or the other. Daniel Badani shows a certain classicism, even a taste for the baroque, tendencies curbed by Roux-Dorlut who, five years younger and of an austere and determined character, tends to simplify by finding everywhere a contemporary expression in architecture. Their first achievements were in Africa, notably in Abidjan where they built, among other works, the courtrooms for the Palace of Justice, the Central Posts and Telecommunications Building, and various residential districts; in Dakar, where they built the Palais du Grand Conseil, which became the National Assembly of Senegal; and in Bouake, where they built the general hospital. In France they produced the plans and numerous buildings for the Centre for Nuclear Studies at Marcoul and at Cadarache, competition projects like the Vincennes Stadium, residential complexes both in the South and in the Paris area, and educational, industrial, public, and administrative buildings throughout the country. In all these projects, Roux-Dorlut expresses a preference for very careful organization of volumes, spaces, and open green areas in relation to their surroundings. One of their most recent projects is St Louis Hospital, where he introduced new forms and volumes around a seventeenth-century historical monument with great sensitivity and respect. In the University of Nancy, the same care for composition within an urban setting, the extremely well considered relationship between different buildings, and the choice of materials, show a remarkable sensitivity and elegance, as well as his tendency to research new forms for each project. With his wife He is especially interested in large-scale designs, amongst which the project for the new Royal Hippone City and the University of Constantine in Algeria, also major undertakings such as the Cézeaux Science Park at Clermont Ferrand, the regional head offices of Crédit Agricole bank at Montpellier, the National Polytechnic Institute at Nancy and the Urban Development building complex in the Sèvres bridge quarter at Boulogne-sur- Seine For the last two years Pierre Roux-Dorlut has worked in partnership with his wife Christine Roux-Dorlut, an architect who has gained wide experience in her own career. Christine Roux-Dorlut graduated from the Warsaw Polytechnic, then the Ecole Spéciale d’Architecture in Paris and the Institute of Urban Planning at the Sorbonne. She devoted a thesis to the Nancy architect Emmanuel HERE,worked under Le Corbusier’s direction for the development of Venise, collaborated with Bodiansky and Candilis at the Atelier des Bâtisseurs set up by Le Corbusier. She is a member of the Academy of Architecture, President of the Anglo-French Union of Architects, Professor at the Schools of American Arts at Fontainbleau. She received the Beauty Award from the City of Paris, member of CIAM, officier of the Legion of Honour. Christine Roux-Dorlut has designed numerous collective and one-family housing projects, mainly with the Caisse de Dépôts and Consignations. Other achievements include: the Maure Vieil urban plan (Alpes Maritimes), study of an arts and crafts village, head office of Amalgamated Dental at Rueil Malmaison, housing and service premises in Paris and the Ile de France. She participated in the urban development plan for Alger (Annassaires new town). Recently she supervised the rehabilitation of the Bel Air Château and estate at Deauville and designed the Gershwin building in Boulogne-sur-Seine. In partnership with Pierre Roux-Dorlut she developed a project for a theme park in a large leisure area, Orlando, Florida. Together they worked on an extensive project at Vence, the home of Matisse, the Artists' City, a centre of contemporary art in the Esterel, a block of one-family housing at Boulogne-sur-Seine, the rehabilitation of a 17th-century château at Montfort l'Amaury.

Rogers (April 19, 1914 – April 28, 1995)International Television Almanac 1962 was an American publicist in the entertainment industry. He worked with notable actors and singers, such as Rita Hayworth, Joan Crawford, Frank Sinatra, Shirley MacLaine, Dean Martin, Audrey Hepburn, Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, Paul McCartney, and many others. Rogers wrote four books, titled Walking the Tightrope: the private confessions of a public relations man, Rogers' Rules for Success, The One-Hat Solution: Rogers' Strategy for Creative Middle Management, and Rogers' Rules for Businesswomen: How to Start a Career and Move Up the Ladder.  Personal life  = Early life = Henry Rogers was born in Irvington, N.J., where his father operated a dry goods store. Rogers was destined to take over his father's dry goods store in New Jersey. He attended the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania, but when his father's store began to fail during the Depression, he had to drop out of school two and a half years into his program. It was January 1934 that he left Penn and enrolled in classes at New York University School of Commerce. Rogers worked 5 days a week at the store, and took classes in the evening. The summer of 1934 his family went bankrupt. On October 1, 1934, they left for Los Angeles, California to join his older sister who had moved with her lawyer husband two years before. = Late Life = He was married to Rosalind Rogers in 1937, and they had one son, Ron, and one daughter, Marcia Ross. Rogers died on April 28, 1995, due to a combination of longstanding heart and kidney problems. At that point, he had worked in the public relations business for 50 years. = Philanthropy = In promoting the arts, Rogers served as chairman of the Center Theatre Group and was a board member of the Performing Arts Council of the Los Angeles County Music Center, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the American Council for the Arts. He was a vice chairman of the American Film Institute and chairman of an advisory committee to the U.S. Information Agency. He also served on the board of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce.  Career  = Early career = After much trouble finding work, Rogers began his career in 1934 as a $5-a-week press agent's office boy for Grace Nolan, a Hollywood press agent. After working for Nolan for a while, Rogers was promoted to $12 an hour. It was then that he began meeting people in the movie business. Rogers was fired after accidentally taking home his boss' keys and causing her to miss an appointment. When the job ended, Rogers, then 21, borrowed $500 from his father to set up his own business in 1935. His first clients were nightclubs and restaurants, which paid little but enabled him to tell the columnists which stars had been seen on the premises. It helped the clients; it also got Rogers better known. = Rogers and Cowan = Henry Rogers founded his own independent public relations firm in 1935. In 1950, 15 years into the business, he partnered with Warren Cowan and changed the name of the firm to Rogers and Cowan. Rogers and Cowan then became the twelfth-largest public relations firm in the United States… Headquartered in Beverly Hills, also offices in New York and London. Crediting him with being the founder of modern-day publicity, The New York Times wrote, \\"Henry C. Rogers transformed the seedy world of the Hollywood press agent into a plush-carpet profession. Rogers was known as the man who elevated industry ethical standards, particularly through his insistence that public relations professionals had as much responsibility to the news media as they did to their clients.\\" Cowan was the idea man, recruiting and working closely with the personalities and the events. \\"He was the Cary Grant of public relations.\\" Henry Rogers created the now famous Oscar campaign when in 1945 he turned Joan Crawford from “box office poison” to an Oscar winner for best actress in a leading role for her performance in “Mildred Pierce.” The NY Times wrote, “Mr. Rogers, who was credited with making Rita Hayworth a household name and with creating the sweeping publicity campaigns that have become a fixture of the annual quest for Academy Awards, became almost as well known in Hollywood as the famous clients” who included Audrey Hepburn, Lucille Ball, Paul Newman, Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, Danny Kaye, Rex Harrison, Gary Cooper, Kirk Douglas, Liz Taylor, Shirley MacLaine, Olivia de Havilland, Jane Wyatt and Jane Wyman. Later expanding into international and corporate PR, representing Fortune 500 companies and earning the prestigious appointment as Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh’s, first ever publicist. Larry Lowenstein wrote that by 1959, \\"Rogers and Cowan was probably the most successful celebrity PR firm in the world.\\" Headquartered in Los Angeles, it was at this time that they opened an office in New York to create a strong presence on the East Coast as well. Lowenstein was hired to manage this office and described Rogers as a \\"micromanager.\\" Lowenstein described him as wanting things done his way no matter how unrealistic the expectations, and he didn't want to hear about the realities of New York media operations versus Hollywood operations. Charles Champin of The New York Times wrote, \\"[I]n 1965, Rogers & Cowan was the powerhouse among independent publicity agencies servicing the entertainment industry.\\" This was attributed to the shrinking of the major studios in the growth years of television, and the decimating of the studio publicity staffs in particular, which had created boom times for the independents.  Hollywood  Henry Rogers is credited by The New York Times as the founder of modern-day publicity. The New York Times wrote, \\"Henry C. Rogers transformed the seedy world of the Hollywood press agent into a plush- carpet profession. Rogers was known as the man who elevated industry ethical standards, particularly through his insistence that public relations professionals had as much responsibility to the news media as they did to their clients.\\" Rita Hayworth kick-started Rogers' career in the Hollywood industry. Rogers met Hayworth in 1939. After being a bit deceitful, Rogers was able to get Hayworth on the cover of Look Magazine, and as a result she signed a contract with him. Rita Hayworth's debut on the cover of Look made her famous, and as a result, Rogers became known as well. In 1940, Rogers was hired by Claudette Colbert and was actually accepted into the publicity business. Joan Crawford then hired Rogers in 1945 after she had been fired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and blackballed in the business. = McCarthyism = During the McCarthy era, in which many celebrities were accused of being communists without regard for evidence, Rogers took the difficult job of defending those who had been accused. He did so at the risk of his own career.

According to some sources, it originated in the village of Skattungbyn in the province of Dalarna.See, e.g.: In 1843, Richard Dybeck published in his version of the song recorded in Skattungbyn. Many arrangements of the song have been written for various choral groups. One of its early arrangements for men's voices was composed by Otto Frederik Tullberg in 1840. The language of \\"Kristallen den fina\\" relies on a poetic structure, using the older, traditional language rather than contemporary Swedish. Thematically, the song reflects a sense of longing and romance between a couple. The song is featured in the 1972 film Jag Heter Stelios (My Name is Stelios), in the scene where the main characters, Stelios and Kostas, walk through Stockholm, whereupon Kostas begins singing it.  Arrangements  Numerous arrangements of the piece have been written: * Otto Fredrik Tullberg for men's choir (1840) * Jacob Niclas Ahlström, for piano (1878) * Eva Toller (1959) * Carl Paulsson for mixed voices (1944) * Carl-Elow Nordström for three-voice mixed voices (1954) * Camilla Liedbergius for mixed voices (1944) * Harvester for voices, guitar, flute, bass and drums (1970) * Erland von Koch for mixed voices or women's choir (1972) * Gunnar Eriksson for mixed voices (1996) * Nils Lindberg for mixed voices (1998) *Falconer as bonus track of their album Northwind (2006)  Further reading  * Hjördis Blomqvist: Kristallen den fina - Mariastudier, 1967 * Hjördis Blomqvist: - och förgyllande skrin - Jungfru Maria i folkfromhet och dikt genom tiderna, 1970 References Category:Swedish folk songs Category:Anonymous works ","title":"Kristallen den fina"},{"id":"49430300","text":"Lloyd Carter (born 1959) is a coach, retired firefighter and former Head Diversity Officer, BCFD; and former president of the Vulcan Blazers, a black fraternal organization of firefighters in Baltimore, Maryland.

He is a retired chief from the Baltimore City Fire Department and is also retired from the military reserve.  History  Carter served in the Army reserve and Maryland National Guard, became a firefighter in 1983 and moved through the ranks, retiring as a Deputy Chief from the BFCD when his position and division was cut by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's budget for 2013. He had previously been president of the Vulcan Blazers, a black fraternal order of firefighters that fought the fire department to diversify the ranks of the fire department of the 65% black city. He had filed suit in federal court alleging that the elimination of his position as head diversity officer was racially motivated, however, the claims were turned down by the court.

He graduated, becoming chief of Emergency Medical Services in Baltimore, and coached high school lacrosse. In 2001, Carter founded a lacrosse organization named Blax Lax to bring in more African-Americans to the sport. In 2011, he helped to organize a lacrosse club at Hampton University. Suddenly, in May 2015, Hampton U announced it was elevating lacrosse to varsity status. They chose Carter to be head coach. While Hampton is not the first HBCU to fund lacrosse, it's the first to do so on the Division I level.

Life Born the son of Gottlieb Wernsdorf the Elder and his wife Magaretha Katharina (nee Nitsch), he lost his father at an early age. He was his mother's caregiver afterward. He was educated by private tutors visiting Wittenberg Latin school, and afterwards studying at the Pforta school. Here he was trained in particular by Friedrich Gotthilf Freitag, from whom he gained insight into the Greek and Roman writers. He was especially attracted to German and Latin literature, and he wrote his own Latin verse. On October 4, 1741, he enrolled at Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg, where, after earning a \\"Magister\\" degree (equivalent to a modern Master's degree) on April 30, 1744, in the following year, on October 17, 1745, he acquired a teaching license. During this period he held lectures, and on July 9, 1750 became an adjunct professor added to the philosophical faculty. During this time he undertook, as was customary, an educational trip and returned on October 4, 1791. At the instigation of Old testament scholar Johann Gottlob Carpzov, he was appointed by Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in autumn 1752 to the faculty of the University of Helmstedt, where he remained as a professor of rhetoric and poetry until his death in 1793. Helmstedt offered him no favorable environment, however. Since the founding of the University of Göttingen in 1734, a large loss of students had gone hand in hand. The Greek language was heard only in connection with theology, while the Latin curriculum was still treated as a scholarly language. Even still, Wernsdorf's scholarly writings brought him a great deal of prestige. His Helmstedt lectures produced many poems, speeches, and dissertations, and he endeavored to distinguish philology from theology. His major work is an edition of Poetae latini minores in seven volumes. The first five volumes were published by Wernsdorf himself (Altenburg, 1780-1788, Helmstedt 1791), a sixth volume was published after his death by his son (Helmstedt, 1799). The seventh volume remained unpublished. After the death of philologist Pieter Burman the Younger in 1778, Wernsdorf succeeded him as the editor of the Latin Anthology. He had a daughter Louise, married to the German theologian Karl Ludwig Nitzsch, and a son Christian Gottlieb Wernsdorf. Further reading * Britta Berg: Wernsdorf, Johann Christian.

His younger brother was Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein, known as the Goethe Tischbein.

This was the first time leaders of the Catholic Church and the Moscow Patriarchate had met. While the meeting was also seen as a symbolic moment in the history of relations between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox churches as a community, which had split in the Great Schism of 1054, centuries before the Moscow Patriarchate was constituted, it was not expected to lead to any immediate rapprochement between them. The 30-point declaration contains a joint call by the two church primates for an end to the persecution of Christians in the Middle East and to wars in the region, expressing their hope that the meeting might contribute to the re-establishment of Christian unity between the two churches. A range of other issues are mentioned in the declaration, including atheism, secularism, consumerism, migrants and refugees, the importance of marriage and the family, and concerns relating to abortion and euthanasia. According to the ROC leadership's public statements made prior and after the Havana meeting, while the document stresses that both churches share the tradition of the first millennium of Christianity, the discussion during the meeting did not attempt to mend any of the persisting doctrinal and ecclesiastical differences between the two churches.Интервью Святейшего Патриарха Кирилла по итогам визита в страны Латинской Америки \\"мы не обсуждали ни одного богословского вопроса. Хорошо это или плохо – другой разговор, но богословие мы не обсуждали [...] Цель встречи никак не была связана с продвижением каких-то богословских соглашений.\\" The Declaration however includes statements about Eastern Catholic Churches in line with the Balamand declaration as well as the conflict in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church expressed disappointment and Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate criticised the latter. Background The Great Schism of 1054 split Christianity between Greek East and Latin West. Attempts were made over the subsequent centuries to heal the rift, such as the 1274 Second Council of Lyon and the 1439 Council of Florence, but these failed. More recent attempts to foster closer relations between the churches included the Catholic–Orthodox Joint Declaration of 1965 following the 1964 meeting between Pope Paul VI and the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople in Jerusalem. Following that meeting and declaration, a number of meetings, visits and symbolic events had taken place involving Catholic and Orthodox leaders (including visits by Pope John Paul II, and especially between several popes and Bartholomew I of Constantinople), but never a meeting between a Pope and a leader of the Russian Orthodox Church. The first time a Pope visited a predominantly Eastern Orthodox country was in 1999 when Pope John Paul II visited Romania. Since 1980, regular plenary sessions of the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church, the latter being led by the Church of Constantinople, had been held. Pope Francis and Patriarch Bartholomew in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem in 2014 Within the communion of the autocephalous (administratively independent) local (national) churches of Orthodoxy, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople – based in what is now Turkey's Istanbul – is recognized as the bishop who enjoys primus inter pares status, albeit having no direct administrative powers over the other Orthodox churches. The Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) which became autocephalous near the end of the 16th century is considered the largest denomination of the local Orthodox churches; it has close ties with the Russian state, thus according a geopolitical significance to a meeting of its Patriarch with a pope. The decentralised nature of Orthodoxy meant that such meeting could not have direct significance for pan-Orthodox issues. Two weeks earlier, the leaders of the Orthodox churches, including Kirill, met in Chambésy, Switzerland, to make final preparations for a historic Great and Holy Council of the Orthodox Church, re-scheduled for June 2016. According to the ROC, it began bilateral dialogue with the Catholic Church in 1967 and the ROC began theological dialogue with the Catholic Church in 1979. Attempts had previously been made to arrange a meeting between a pope and a Russian patriarch, but these attempts had failed. Tensions had risen between the churches after the fall of Communism as the Churches \\"moved to pick up the pieces\\". Negotiations had been held in the 1990s for a possible meeting between Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow and Pope John Paul II. According to the United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, the two churches established a joint working group, which met in May and September 2004, to discuss specific concerns. Representatives of both churches reported that the working group contributed to an improved atmosphere. In an August 2004 gesture of reconciliation, John Paul II presented an 18th-century copy of the icon of Our Lady of Kazan to Alexy II. In April 2005, John Paul II died and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was elected as Pope Benedict XVI. In April 2005, ROC Bishop Hilarion Alfeyev, as chairman of the Representation of the Russian Orthodox Church to the European Institutions, proposed \\"a European Catholic–Orthodox Alliance\\". In May 2005, Cardinal Walter Kasper proposed convoking \\"a synod of reconciliation\\" on the 1,000-year anniversary of the Council of Bari in 2098, and proposed an alliance with Orthodox and Protestants against secularism. This alliance would \\"help one another mutually in favor of common values, of a culture of life, of the dignity of the person, of solidarity and social justice, of peace and the safeguarding of creation,\\" according to Kasper. In May, then-Metropolitan Kirill met with Benedict XVI in the Vatican, and they highlighted their commitment to working cooperatively. The possibility of a meeting of Kirill (elected Patriarch in 2009) with Benedict XVI had been explored prior to Benedict's retirement in March 2013, and Benedict met the future Patriarch Kirill in Rome in 2006 when Kirill was chairman of the Department of External Church Relations for the Moscow Patriarchate. Meeting in Havana Havana airport VIP Lounge Two years of secretive planning and months of detailed negotiation were necessary to arrange the meeting between Francis and Kirill. Francis was willing to meet Kirill, having said in November 2014: \\"I'll go wherever you want. You call me and I'll go.\\" Agreement from the Russian Orthodox side was complicated over the church's close ties to the Russian state and international tensions over Russia's intervention in Crimea and Ukraine. The pre-meeting announcement from the Moscow Patriarchate stated that they had agreed to \\"put aside internal disagreements\\" in order to focus on the plight of Christians being persecuted. Cuba, a location that was significant to both sides, provided the requirements for a neutral meeting place as neither Rome nor Moscow would have been suitable. The meeting, made possible by the timing of both leaders' visits to the region, was announced a week in advance on 5 February 2016. The meeting took place on 12 February 2016 in a VIP room at José Martí International Airport near Havana, Cuba. Francis arrived at 2 pm local time, and the two leaders embraced and kissed. A 2-hour private meeting was followed by the signing of their joint declaration, which had been prepared in advance. Kirill was in Havana on an official visit as part of a tour of the region, including visits to Brazil and Paraguay. Francis' airplane arrived at the airport on his way to his tour of Mexico. Cuban dignitaries attending the occasion included President Raúl Castro, Cardinal Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino (Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Cristóbal de la Habana) and Archbishop (of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Cuba). The meeting itself was held in a private room and attended by translators and by the aides of the two leaders, in addition to Cardinal Kurt Koch, president of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, and Metropolitan Hilarion Alfeyev, chairman of the Department of External Church Relations for the Moscow Patriarchate. At the end of the meeting, there was an exchange of gifts. Francis gave Kirill a chalice as well as a reliquary of the 9th-century Saint Cyril (buried in Rome). Kirill gave Francis a copy of the icon of the Our Lady of Kazan. Other presents exchanged were a Spanish-language translation of Kirill's book Freedom and Responsibility (2011) and a Russian-language translation of Francis's encyclical Laudato si' (2015). Speaking to news media several days after the meeting, Patriarch Kirill said, citing as the reason \\"powerful forces\\" opposing such meeting (apart from the fearful Orthodox faithful), that the meeting had had to be prepared in strict secrecy; he also stressed that not a single theological issue had been discussed.Встреча с понтификом готовилась втайне, рассказал патриарх Кирилл NEWSru, 24 February 2016: \\"Предстоятель РПЦ назвал ожидаемым, что у верующих в связи с его встречей с папой Франциском возникли опасения по поводу того, \\"не будет ли как-то деформирована доктрина, не будет ли каких-то изменений в литургической жизни, в пастырских подходах\\". Он констатировал, что на встрече не обсуждалось ни одного богословского вопроса, и \\"не нужно ничего бояться\\".\\"Интервью Святейшего Патриарха Кирилла по итогам визита в страны Латинской Америки, The ROC official website, 22 February 2016: \\"— А Вас отговаривали от встречи или нет? – Меня никто не отговоривал, потому что никто не знал. Об этой встрече знали пять человек, не буду называть их святые имена. Почему было так? Потому что подготовить такую встречу в условиях гласности невозможно – слишком много противников. И даже не тех наших милых и добрых православных людей, которые считают, что есть какая-то опасность в самой встрече, – есть мощные силы, которые этого не очень хотят. Поэтому надо было спокойно и в тишине ее готовить, что мы и сделали.\\" Joint declaration The joint declaration was published by the Vatican in Italian, Russian, English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic. The Russian Orthodox Church published it in Russian, English, Italian, French, Spanish and Ukrainian. It consisted of 30 numbered sections on a range of topics. The first section of the declaration gives thanks for this meeting \\"the first in history\\" and refers to the leaders as \\"brothers in the Christian faith\\". Sections 2 and 3 refers to their meeting place of Cuba as \\"the crossroads of North and South, East and West\\", and expressed joy at the growth of Christianity in Latin America. Sections 4–6 expresses their views on their shared spiritual tradition (\\"the first millennium of Christianity\\") and their hopes that their meeting \\"may contribute to the re–establishment of this unity willed by God\\". Sections 7–21 refer to \\"the challenges of the contemporary world\\". Issues raised include the persecution of Christians in the Middle East and North Africa; the impact of civil war, chaos and terrorist violence; the exodus of Christians from Syria and Iraq; and the suffering experienced by the faithful of other religious traditions. The declaration refers to the renewal of the Christian faith in Russia and Eastern Europe and the \\"breaking of the chains of militant atheism\\", the rise of secularism, consumerism, inequality, migrants and refugees, and the place of Christianity in the process of European integration. Further sections emphasise the importance of the family, of marriage between one man and one woman, and their concerns relating to abortion, euthanasia, and \\"biomedical reproduction technology\\". The issues of the schism within the Orthodox community in Ukraine, the conflict between Ukraine′s Catholics and the Orthodox, and the political situation in Ukraine are raised in sections 25–27. The closing sections call on Catholics and Orthodox to \\"work together fraternally in proclaiming the Good News of salvation\\" and to \\"give shared witness to the Spirit of truth in these difficult times\\". The declaration concludes with a prayer to Mary, who is invoked by the names of the \\"Blessed Virgin Mary\\" as well as \\"Holy Mother of God\\". Commentary and reactions The meeting was characterised by news media commentators, who were largely uninformed of the pivotal facts concerning the history of Christianity in Russia and tending toward sensationalism, as being \\"historic\\", \\"richly symbolic\\", and as the \\"meeting of the millennium\\". Analysts also opine that the meeting had a geopolitical dimension, being about rivalries among Orthodox leaders, long-standing tensions within Ukrainian Orthodoxy, and about Russian President Vladimir Putin asserting Russia's influence on the world stage, motivated by his actions in Syria and Ukraine. Overall, the meeting was \\"not expected to lead to any immediate rapprochement between the Eastern and Western Churches\\". Kirill has faced criticism over his policies that have brought the Russian Orthodox Church closer to the Russian state. In the 2012 Russian presidential election he supported Vladimir Putin, likening Putin's presidency to \\"a miracle from God\\". Yury Avvakumov, assistant professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame, describes the Moscow Patriarchate as \\"an instrument of Russian international policy an effective transmitter worldwide of the political interests of the Russian rulers.\\" The view that the meeting was motivated by internal Orthodox politics was expressed by George Demacopoulos, Greek-Orthodox chairman of Orthodox Christian studies at Fordham University in New York: \\"This isn't benevolence. It's not a newfound desire for Christian unity. ...It is almost entirely about (Kirill) posturing and trying to present himself as the leader of Orthodoxy.\\" Similar views are expressed by Borys Gudziak (Ukrainian Catholic Eparchial Bishop of Paris), who states that \\"the two protagonists in this drama come to it bearing different legacies. Francis is the leader of a billion Catholics and is the single most respected moral authority in the world. Kirill is the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, which is still limping from a century of persecution and still looking for its moral voice in post-Soviet Russian society.\\" Gudziak also highlighted the internal tensions in Orthodoxy, and that an independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church would greatly reduce the power of the Russian Orthodox Church. He pointed out the tensions arising from the impending Pan-Orthodox council in June, the first to be held in centuries. In addition to this, Patriarch Kirill may face opposition from conservative groups in Russian Orthodoxy opposed to closer ties with the Catholic Church. US Jesuit priest Robert F. Taft credits the new approach by Francis for creating the conditions needed for the meeting, opining that \\"Russia is coming to understand that the Catholic Church sees them as a sister church, not as someone who separated from the only real Church.\\" The New York Times states that for Francis, \\"the meeting was an ecumenical and diplomatic coup that eluded his predecessors\\", but that he could face criticism for indirectly providing support for the Russian military intervention in Syria and Ukraine. The Associated Press report states that the meeting \\"cemented Francis' reputation as a risk-taking statesman who values dialogue, bridge-building and rapprochement at almost any cost\\", but adds that he \\"has also come under criticism for essentially allowing himself to be used by a Russia eager to assert itself\\". When asked about the possibility of being the first pope to visit Russia and China, Francis pointed to his heart and said: \\"China and Russia, I have them here. Pray.\\" According to The Economist, the meeting was a diplomatic victory for Russia's government: \\"The [pope's] meeting with his Russian counterpart drew Francis deep into geopolitics, and led him to condone Russia's foreign policy and critique the West's in ways that infuriated some of the Catholic church's supporters\\". Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, says he was disappointed and his church members felt \\"betrayed by the Vatican\\" over the declaration's stance regarding Ukraine. Nonetheless, Shevchuk asks, \\"all not to rush in judging , not to remain on the reality level of those who expect only politics from this meeting and want to exploit a humble pope for their human plans at all costs. If we don't enter into the spiritual reality of the Holy Father and do not discern together with him the action of the Holy Spirit, we shall remain imprisoned by the prince of this world and his followers.\\" The nuncio to Ukraine, Claudio Gugerotti, called for patience and indicated that the declaration was a compromise statement. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate also criticised the declaration; it states that the declaration ignores the opinion and position of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. It also protests that the declaration had not stated that the War in Donbass was a Russian military intervention in Ukraine. In a press conference on 18 February 2016, Francis explained that questions like who started the \\"state of war in Ukraine\\" was a \\"historical problem\\". Reactions inside the ROC According to ROC official documents, the most important goal of the Orthodox Church in relations with non-Orthodox confessions is the restoration of the God-commanded Christian unity. Indifference to this task or its rejection is a sin against Jesus' command of unity. Among the duties of the Holy Synod are to: \\"evaluate major events in the inter-church, inter- confessional and interreligious relations,\\" \\"maintain inter-confessional and interreligious relations,\\" \\"coordinate the actions of\\" the ROC \\"in its efforts to reach peace and justice,\\" and \\"express pastoral concern for social problems.\\" Nevertheless, some ROC members have questioned the orthodoxy of the Francis–Kirill meeting and ROC preparations for the 2016 Pan-Orthodox Council. There are \\"some religious nationalists\\" in Belarus, Moldova, and the Russian Federation who have been \\"stirred into action\\" by the Francis–Kirill meeting and \\"some conservative clerics and monasteries have reacted to the\\" meeting and joint declaration \\"by ceasing their public prayers for Kirill.\\" Kirill had reformed the administration of the ROC and consolidated authority in the ROC patriarch. According to , Kirill \\"has no obvious enemies in the episcopate\\" but some \\"marginal figures\\" in the clergy are enemies. Some ROC priests have criticized Kirill and called his acts heretical. For example, Archpriest Vladislav Emelyanov said that the Francis–Kirill meeting \\"evokes a feeling of betrayal\\" and that Kirill was destroying conciliarity in the ROC by first replacing local synod bishops and then not consulting fellow bishops in such a serious matter. This was, in Emelyanov opinion, \\"clear Papism.\\" The has called Emelyanov's statement \\"harmful and unreasonable.\\" Priest Alexei Morozov said that the ROC was on the verge of a split and he encouraged ROC members to dissent in two ways: by attending \\"temples, where priests strictly adhere to the tenets of Christianity and do not accept heresy papacy and ecumenism\\" and by asking the Moscow Patriarchate to convene the Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church to condemn what Morozov believes are heresies. According to newsru.com, the sentiments expressed by Emelyanov and Morozov are not sensationalism but exist among some members of the ROC. Chapnin points out that \\"there exist fundamentalist groups, radically Orthodox in disposition, who condemn any rapprochement\\" between the ROC and the Catholic Church. Chapnin thinks that the fundamentalist rhetoric is \\"very emotional and of little substance.\\" The Holy Synod of the Moldovan Orthodox Church published an appeal addressed to those who omit Kirill from their public prayers. Kirill's spokesman, Priest , said these reactions stemmed from the fact that \\"people have not fully understood what occurred.\\" The deputy chairman of the Department for External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate (DECR), Archimandrite , noted \\"that the vast majority\\" of ROC members accepted the meeting and the results positively. Bulekov said that the ROC did not disregard the criticisms of the Francis–Kirill meeting by some Orthodox and answered most questions about what happened. Bulekov commented that in most cases the same people made critical remarks and \\"if not for this meeting, there would be other reasons for such statements.\\" Metropolitan Hilarion Alfeyev told Russian News Agency TASS that critics of dialogue who consider Christian disunity to be normal hold a fallacious position against Jesus' command, in , that they all may be one. Alfeyev pointed out that this command had been broken and this condition is wrong and sinful. The purpose of the dialogue is reflected in the joint statement and is not intended to overcome division and differences, according to Alfayev. Metropolitan pointed out that the declaration does not contain any doctrinal agreements or concessions from Orthodoxy to Catholicism. The presence of Western saints in the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, Viktorin points out, is evidence of a millennium of common doctrine. It declares a \\"common Christian understanding of values\\" together with a \\"desire to follow them,\\" according to Metropolitan , and \\"does not concern dogmatic matters\\". \\"It would be a great mistake,\\" Mercurius said, \\"to stop conversing with each other and to throw stones at one another.\\" 2019 meeting with the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and renewed tensions  At the beginning of a two day Vatican meeting with Ukrainian Greek-Catholic leaders on 5 July 2019, Pope Francis hinted that he supported the Church's concerns in Ukraine and called for greater humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The Pope previously expressed dismay over the Russian Orthodox Church's role in the conflict in Ukraine in early 2019 as well. On 4 July 2019, Pope Francis also declared that he will not meet with leaders of the Russian Orthodox Church if he were to accept an invitation to Russia. Despite having a history of good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Putin, who held a \\"cordial\\" meeting with Pope Francis when this was brought up, also stated to the Pope that he would not invite the Pope to Russia without this condition. During the 5 July meeting, Pope Francis also criticized the Russian Orthodox church's attempts to manipulate \\"other religions\\" in Ukraine as well.

The podcast is set in the fictional world of Foon, a magical realm where a fictionalized version of Niekamp is trapped after falling through a dimensional rift in Chicago. Niekamp and his co-hostsa wizard named Usidore the Blue (Matt Young), and a shapeshifter, Chunt (Adal Rifai)interview various magical creatures at the Vermillion Minotaur tavern. The first episode was released in March 2015. New episodes are released every Monday. Niekamp, Young, Rifai, and many of their guests are regulars of the Chicago improv comedy community. The podcast has generated a strong fanbase and received generally positive reviews. iTunes has named it as one of the Best Podcasts of 2015 and The Guardian ranked it one of the \\"10 best new podcasts of 2015 (that aren't Serial)\\". Concept Hello from the Magic Tavern is hosted by a fictionalized version of Arnie Niekamp, who fell into a trans-dimensional portal behind a Burger King restaurant in Chicago and landed in Foon, a magical land in the style of Narnia or Middle-Earth. Although unable to return to Earth, Arnie starts a podcast using equipment that he happened to have with him and a weak Wi-Fi signal from the Burger King through the portal to teach people of Earth about Foon. He is joined each week by co- hosts Usidore the Blue (Matt Young), a wizard, and Chunt (Adal Rifai), a shapeshifter who is in the form of a badger for most of the podcast. The podcast is recorded in The Vermilion Minotaur, a tavern located in a town called Hogsface near McShingleshane Forest. Each week, Arnie, Usidore, and Chunt interview magical creatures to introduce the listener to new aspects of the world of Foon. Real-life fans and listeners of the podcast can interact with the characters by sending email messages to Arnie and Chunt (some of which are read on the show) and through in-character Twitter accounts set up for Usidore and Chunt. Production The podcast was conceived by Arnie Niekamp, who said he enjoyed podcasts that felt like a \\"laid-back chat show\\" and relished the idea of introducing a \\"really weird story\\". He said that a podcast had to \\"do something sort of high-concept or a little more niche\\" to distinguish itself and be successful. Niekamp pitched the idea of the podcast to Matt Young and Adal Rifai, who ultimately became his co-hosts. The trio recorded a pair of \\"test episodes\\" to ensure the concept worked, and they eventually became the first two episodes of the actual podcast. Niekamp, Young, and Rifai are improv comedians from the Chicago area who have performed together for more than a decade prior to Hello From the Magic Tavern. They worked together on the weekly satire show Whirled News Tonight at the iO Theater, in which they would improvise scenes based on newspaper clippings. Nearly all of the guest stars interviewed on the podcast each week are also improv comedians from Chicago. Cast =Regular cast= *Arnie Niekamp as a fictionalized version of himself. Arnie is the host of the podcast. He has a wife named Sarah and a newborn daughter, although they have not had contact since he first became stranded in Foon. The character is an audience surrogate who leads the podcast's interviews and guides listeners through the magical land of Foon, and also often serves as the straight man to Usidore and Chunt. The real Niekamp had previously hosted other comedic podcasts prior to Hello From the Magic Tavern, and is a writer for the video games You Don't Know Jack and Fibbage, both by Jackbox Games. *Adal Rifai as Chunt, a shapeshifter who takes the form of a badger. Rifai moved to Chicago to pursue acting and received a scholarship to The Second City improvisational comedy school. His classmates there encouraged him to enroll in classes at the iO Theater. After graduating there, he was placed on a few improv teams, and eventually began performing at the Whirled News Tonight. *Matt Young as Usidore the Blue, a loud and boisterous wizard who constantly speaks of his quest to defeat a villain named \\"the Dark Lord\\". In each episode, he introduces himself by his extremely-long full name: \\"I am Usidore! Wizard of the 12th Realm of Ephysiyies, Master of Light and Shadow, Manipulator of Magical Delights, Devourer of Chaos, Champion of the Great Halls of Terr’akkas. The elves know me as Fi’ang Yalok. The dwarves know me as Zoenen Hoogstandjes. And I am also known in the Northeast as Gaismunēnas Meistar.\\" Young also appears in the comedic podcast Improvised Star Trek. =Recurring guest stars= *Tim Sniffen as the Mysterious Man, an unidentified announcer who records introductions and outros for each episode of the podcast, explaining to listeners that the podcast is entirely fictional.

Guardian writer Melissa Locker called the show \\"unabashedly goofy\\" and \\"incredibly entertaining and binge-worthy\\", particularly praising the comedic chemistry of Niekamp, Young, and Rifai. The A.V. Club also ranked it among the best podcasts of 2015, and declared the Vermilion Minotaur the \\"best fictional place we want to go to\\". Writer Ben Cannon called the podcast Hello From the Magic Tavern \\"comic podcasting's most continually rewarding achievement\\", and praised it for its worldbuilding abetted by consistent callbacks to jokes and references from past episodes. He added, \\"There is simply no other podcast recording today which contains as vast and vivid a collection of fantastic oddities as Hello From The Magic Tavern.\\" NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour included the 59th episode \\"Dr Ward\\" among its Favorite Podcast Episodes Of 2016. Panelist and author Glen Weldon states that \\"Ok, yes, I've talked about this podcast a lot. And Linda, Stephen and I even appeared on it once. But this episode represents such a hugely satisfying listen I had to include it. HOWEVER. It's not an episode to jump in on. Instead, I'd recommend starting with the very first episode, to determine if it's your thing. If it is, this episode, which arrives after the show's been building out its huge, improv- driven world for over a year, cracks open everything that came before in a rich and powerful way. To say how it does this would spoil it.\\" Max Temkin, co-creator of the card game Cards Against Humanity, has been a strong proponent of the show, calling it in a blog entry \\"probably my favorite comedy thing happening right now\\". He said the show is effective because of the \\"special comedy relationship\\" of Niekamp, Young, and Rifai, of whom he said, \\"their instincts are incredible, and they have the kind of rapport that only comes from a decade of working together\\". Steve Guntli of The Northern Light praised the show's consistency and world-building, which he said makes Foon \\"feel like a real and lived-in place\\". He also praised the voice acting, particularly the performance of Matt Young, who he said plays Usidore to \\"pompous perfection\\".  Foon  Foon is a fictional magical place where Arnie Niekamp, Adal Rifai, and Matt Young's podcast takes place. It is the \\"alternate dimension\\" to earth that Arnie traveled to. It has many similar components to Earth, and is home to most of the fantastical guests on the show. Its most popular sport is \\"Mittens,\\" which is a variation of football with very contradictory rules. It is full of magical beings like memory gremlins and reverse mermaids. Their most popular song, \\"7 Dragons and a Baby,\\" can be heard by listening to magic travelling bards: Glenn Miller and Spants.

It is a shrub with grey-green foliage, densely hairy leaves, and usually lilac to purple flowers but a yellow flowered form also occurs. Description Eremophila malacoides is a greyish, spreading shrub with many tangled branches usually growing to a height of less than . Its leaves and branches are covered with grey, matted hairs. The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and are mostly elliptic to egg-shaped, long and wide. The flowers are borne singly, without a stalk in leaf axils. There are 5 hairy, overlapping, lance-shaped sepals which are long. The hairs on the outer surface of the sepals are yellowish and form a dense, loose mat. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is lilac-coloured to purple on the outside and white with purple spots on the inside. In the Granite Peak area, the flowers of this species are more usually yellow. The outer surface of the tube and petal lobes is hairy, the inner surface of the lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is filled with long, soft hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs after rain from April to November and the fruits which follow are dry, woody, hairy, oval-shaped and long.Wiluna E. malacoides flower detail Taxonomy and naming Eremophila malacoides was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The specific epithet is said to be derived from the Greek malae-, 'soft' and oides, 'form of', referring to the soft hairs on the branches and leaves of this species. Sharr gives the derivation as from the Greek malaco- meaning \\"soft\\" and -oides, \\"-like\\". The word in ancient Greek for soft is malakos (μαλακός).Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. Revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie.Oxford: Clarendon Press. Ancient Greek eidos (εἶδος) means 'form' or 'shape'. Distribution and habitat This eremophila occurs between Meekatharra and Leonora in the Gascoyne and Murchison biogeographic regions. It usually grows in saline areas that are subjected to occasional flooding. Conservation status Eremophila malacoides is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife Use in horticulture This small, compact shrub nearly always has flowers in a garden setting, is tolerant of a wide range of soils, including heavy and saline soils and is frost and drought tolerant. It can be propagated from cuttings and in most situations will grow well on its own roots. It is a hardy garden plant that will respond to a light application of fertiliser in spring.

He dedicated much of his life to innovative approaches to teaching singers. Born in Piotrków Trybunalski, Poland, he studied in Warsaw, Milan, and Paris under Vincenzo Maria Pintorno, Maria Maddalena Fratini, André Caplet, Édouard de Reszke, and Jean de Reszke. He first went to the United States in 1911 and immigrated in 1913. As a baritone, he initially sang for the Boston Opera, but, he did not abandon his native land, Poland. He worked with Ignacy Jan Paderewiski to raise over $500,000 for Poland and recruited men for the Polish army during World War I. He became the head of the National Recording Studio launching his lifelong work to improve singing through the use of phonographic technology. In 1921, he returned from a trip to Poland and planned to open a studio in New York City. In that same year, he published The Singer And His Art. He moved to Detroit initially as a teacher, but, he became the director of the Detroit Civic Opera from 1928 to 1938. His production of Aidia in 1930 incorporated the use of African American actors, a dramatic move for that era. In 1938, the Detroit company began to struggle financially and he resigned moving to Los Angeles in 1939. In California, he pursued his hope to improve American singing through recording technology. He prepared a set of recordings of commonly sung pieces without the voice. This “music minus one” approach gives singers an opportunity to develop their skills without the need for a live accompanist or group. Eventually moving to San Diego, he died in 1965 in San Diego.California, Death Index, 1940-1997 He had one son.

The track was released by Warner Bros. Records as the lead single off the project's debut album Forever described as an electro retro funk track, written, produced and performed by Dubuc, is about him wanting to \\"disappear completely and start over\\" after he didn't let anyone know about him moving from Dallas to Los Angeles, as reflected in the song's chorus. The official music video for the track, directed by Josh Thomas, was released in February 2014 by Vice Media's electronic music channel Thump. However, a fan-animated music video for the song, which garnered over two million views in less than a month, helped put the track in the top 20 of the American Billboard Dance/Electronic Songs chart. The song was also very well received from music critics. Production and composition \\"Ghost\\" is a four-minute, eighteen-second song described by Vibe as an \\"electro retro funk\\" track with harmonies influenced from disco. \\"Ghost\\" is about wanting to \\"disappear completely and start over\\" again, as it was inspired by Dubuc relocating from Dallas to Los Angeles without letting anyone know. The concept of the song is sung in the hook \\"This time I might just disappear.\\" He described it as \\"really special song. The moment I wrote it, I thought, 'Wow, this could really be something.\\" Written and produced by Dubuc, the original mix that appears on Mystery Skulls' debut album Forever was mixed by Jeremy Wheatley for 365 Artists at 4db Studios in London, with Adam Looker assisting. Colin Leonard mastered the track at SING Mastering in Atlanta using SING Technology. Release Warner Bros. Records premiered the final mix of \\"Ghost\\" for streaming on December 10, 2013, and the song became available in digital stores by January 31, 2014. A remix by house producer Claude VonStroke was released on February 18, 2014 by Spin magazine, which journalist Chris Martins named a \\"demented dance-floor delight.\\" A day later, Vice Media's channel Noisey released a remix by New York City-based duo Solidisco, advertised to \\"make you nostalgic for the long weekend just gone (thanks President's Day!), but super happy because Friday is just a little bit closer than it should be.\\" Both re-workings were part of the song's remix EP that also featured remixes from Fred Falke, Thomas Newson and Viceroy. A re- cut by producer Martignetti that was not on the EP premiered on the blog Stoney Roads, who noted the song to be fitting in an episode of the HBO series Girls. \\"Ghost\\" was also included on the soundtrack for the game WWE 2K15, and Dubuc has admitted to being happy of being involved with the game: \\"I've been a really big fan for a long time, and they found out I was a fan, and it turns out that some of the people that work at WWE and in the game specifically are fans of Mystery Skulls and they were like, \\"What the fuck? This is so cool! Let's do something together!\\"\\" \\"Ghost\\" garnered favorable reviews, with many writers highlighting its catchiness and Dubuc's vocals. One reviewer from Dance Music Northwest praised the song for putting Dubuc's diverse talent on display. However, a critic who reviewed Forever was more mixed on the song, calling it, along with \\"When I'm With You\\", to be \\"slightly lackluster and boring.\\" The track also did well commercially; it debuted at its peak position of number 15 on the American Billboard Dance/Electronic Songs chart, issue dated November 22, 2014, and landed the on the digital component of that chart in the top 20 the same week. It lasted on the Dance/Electronic chart for eighteen weeks, ending up at number 99 on the chart's 2015 year-end list. Music videos The official video for \\"Ghost\\", produced by company Oh Yeah Wow and directed by Josh Thomas, parodies the 1973 horror film The Exorcist, but was also noted to spoof scenes from 1976's Carrie by one writer. It premiered on February 4, 2014 by Vice's electronic music channel Thump, who advertised it as \\"a really good video. It's got zombies. It's got a funny exorcist. It's got old people looking like they're about to poop their Depends. People (and things) fly through the air. It's neat, and it's all set to an extremely catchy beat.\\" The video, which involves a priest who dances through the exorcism of a young woman, was well received by publications. This included a writer for Bloody Disgusting who called it \\"awesome\\", and another one who honored the choreography of the dancing priest as \\"seriously impressive\\". However, the song's commercial success has been attributed to the critically acclaimed fan-made animated music video by Ben Mangum, also known as MysteryBen27, that garnered more than two million views in under a month. The Scooby-Doo-esque video involves kids running in \\"the most colorful, vibrant, psychedelic, funky fresh haunted mansion I've ever had the pleasure of laying eyes on\\", as described by PrinceofTheUniverse of Kotaku's Talk Amongst Yourselves. He also noted that \\"Everything happens on rhythm to the song which some may find a little cheesy cliche but it's a nice way to keep the viewer into whats happening visual while still enjoying the music.

Life Glandorp was born the son of a tailor in Münster and was educated at the Gymnasium Paulinum in his native city. At 17 he went to the city of Rostock, and then returned in 1522 to Münster and became a teacher at the Gymnasium Paulinum. In 1529 he went to Wittenberg and became a student there of German reformer Philip Melanchthon, a collaborator with Martin Luther. As the Protestant Reformation progressed, Glandorp in 1532 took a position overseeing a large Latin school, established under the Conventual Franciscans. This school did not last long. Finding himself in conflict with Anabaptist leader of Münster Bernhard Rothmann, he had to leave the city in February 1534. He endeavored to find employment in several places, but could not find a position. He asked the Landgrave Philip I take him in Hesse, and this gave him the chair of the History Department at University of Marburg, the school Philip had established, which had previously been held by German humanist writer Hermann von dem Busche. He left Marburg in 1536. That same year he took on the management of the Latin schools in Braunschweig, and in Hamelin for a short time in 1551, in the gymnasium in Hanover from 1551 to 1555, Goslar in 1560.

Biography =Early life= Tittle was born the oldest of five children to Juanita, a record shop owner, and businessman James O. Tittle in Chicago, Illinois. Tittle grew up in the Robert Taylor Homes public housing project in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the south side. For high school, Tittle attended Dunbar Vocational High School; later graduating in 1964. After high school, Tittle then studied art education and drama with a minor in journalism at Chicago State University, graduating in 1971. =Career= Tittle began her career in radio at Chicago's WBEE station in 1970. After two years at WBEE, Tittle moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin where she worked as a weekend radio personality at WNOV radio in 1972. Tittle worked at the radio station for a year, later returning to Chicago in 1973. Shortly after returning to Chicago, Tittle became the midday and evening host of WBMX-FM radio, where R&B; and soul music were showcased. She started her career at the station reporting news and working overnight, eventually moving to weekday afternoons a year later. Due to her growing popularity, Tittle was sought after by Johnson Publishing Company's WJPC radio station. They offered to double her salary, an offer she accepted in 1978. Tittle co-hosted alongside Tom Joyner and DJ Bebe D'Banana, and later JoJo Bell.

For the first few years, she worked between the FM and AM stations until automated overnight broadcasts came into play, which resulted in her being laid off in 2000. After a year's hiatus from the public, she launched The LaDonna Tittle TV/Radio Show on Chicago's CAN-TV in 2001. The show began as a platform to chat with entertainers until she decided to shift to cooking after viewing a soul food exhibit in 2003. Tittle also starred in R.

The Tackers ultimately failed in their efforts, but their actions proved highly polarising in the 1705 English general election. While there were some successful Whig campaigns to unseat Tacker MPs, some parts of the country had the Tories successfully campaign under the rallying cry of 'Church in Danger', with the Tackers' efforts being positively seen as an effort to protect the established Church of England from nonconformists and Dissent. The Tackers' actions caused Queen Anne to turn away from their party as the War of Spanish Succession continued for the next decade.

The organisation was known for its extreme pro-Soviet stance. The Proletarian group emerged from a split in the New Communist Party (NCP). The NCP had been founded in 1977 by members of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) who disagreed with the direction that party was taking, perceiving that it had abandoned Marxism-Leninism in favour of social democracy. This was heavily linked to the NCP's support for the Soviet Union and the CPGB's more critical stance on that entity. Proletarian consisted of a small group around Keith Nelson. There were members in London, Dorset, Brighton and Bristol. According to one source, it had about twenty members.Communist Party Alliance. . Initially, they were not a separate organisation but rather a faction within the NCP. The faction emerged in 1981. They argued that the NCP’s newspaper, The New Worker, should be aimed at raising the level of politically advanced workers. Specifically they looked towards CPGB which they believed was corrupt but had to be saved as it was the largest party for the politically conscious members of the working class. The leadership of the NCP, however, was adamant that the paper should be aimed towards ordinary workers.Lawrence Parker (2012). The Kick Inside: Revolutionary Opposition in the CPGB, 1945-1991. London: November Publications Ltd. P. 106. The group was ultimately expelled from the NCP in 1982. It went on to produce a journal, Proletarian, centred on the aims that the group was originally formed for; that is appealing to the CPGB's membership base. Two issues were published, the first in 1983 and the second in 1984. Selected articles and correspondence was published in 1987. The specific political stance taken by the journal was a strongly pro-Soviet one.Communist Party Alliance. .Parker (2012), p. 107. The group dissolved in 1988. One reason appears to have been disagreements between Keith Nilsen, founder and leading member, and a number of members who accused him of not abiding by political committee decisions.Parker (2012), pp. 113-14.

A. v. Caulkett, 575 U.S. ___, 135 S. Ct. 1995 (2015), is a bankruptcy law case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States on June 1, 2015. In Caulkett, the Court held that 11 U.S.C. § 506(d) does not permit a Chapter 7 debtor to void a junior mortgage on the debtor's property when the amount of the debt secured by the senior mortgage on that property exceeds the property's current market value., 135 S. Ct. 1995, 1998 (2015).See also Raff Ferraioli, Bank of America, N.A. v. Caulkett: Dewsnup Lives, (Dec. 2015) (\\"Dewsnup Lives\\"); Bruce A. Markell, Loser's Lament: Caulkett and ASARCO, (Aug. 2015) (\\"Loser's Lament\\"). Background =\\"Allowed Secured Claims\\" in Bankruptcy= Statutory Provisions Section 506(d) of the Bankruptcy Code provides, as a general rule, \\"[t]o the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is not an allowed secured claim, such lien is void.\\" (emphasis added). Although § 506(d) provides two exceptions to this general rule, the facts of Caulkett did not implicate either of these exceptions. As used in the Bankruptcy Code, the term \\"claim\\" includes any \\"right to payment,\\" and the term \\"lien\\" means a \\"charge against or interest in property to secure payment of a debt or performance of an obligation.\\" (definition of \\"claim\\") and (definition of \\"lien\\"). :The full text of § 101(5) reads as follows: ::\\"The term 'claim' means— :::(A) right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured; or :::(B) right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured, or unsecured.\\" :By corollary, defines the term \\"debt\\" to mean \\"liability on a claim.\\" A claim is \\"allowed\\" if proof of the claim is filed under 11 U.S.C. § 501, and the claim is not objected to by a party in interest. (\\"A claim or interest, proof of which is filed under section 501 of this title, is deemed allowed, unless a party in interest, including a creditor of a general partner in a partnership that is a debtor in a case under chapter 7 of this title, objects.\\") As to what constitutes a \\"secured\\" claim, § 506(a) provides the following: Where a creditor's allowed claim is \\"secured by a lien on property in which the [bankruptcy] estate has an interest,\\" that allowed claim \\"is a secured claim to the extent of the value of such creditor's interest in the estate's interest in such property ... and is an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditor's interest ... is less than the amount of such allowed claim.\\" (emphasis added). The filing of a petition in bankruptcy \\"creates an estate[.]\\" . With certain exceptions not relevant here, that estate includes \\"all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\\" § 541(a)(1). This, then, is the \\"estate\\" to which § 506(a)(1) refers. In § 506(a), a creditor-lienor's \\"interest\\" in the estate's interest in certain collateral property means that creditor's lien on that property. (\\"In subsection (a) of [§ 506] the creditor's \\"interest in property\\" obviously means his security interest without taking account of his right to immediate possession of the collateral on default.\\"). As a functional matter, the value of a creditor-lienor's lien generally depends on four factors: # the \\"purpose of the valuation and ... the proposed disposition or use of [the collateral] property.\\". # the value of the collateral property (and the estate's interest therein) # the amount of the creditor-lienor's allowed claim # the priority of the creditor-lienor's lien in relation to other interests in the collateral property.See generally 4 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 506.03[5] (16th ed. 2015) (discussing § 506(a)(1) and how courts determine \\"the estate's interest in the collateral, and ... the creditor's interest in that interest.\\") For example, consider the following situation: :*Debtor Mr. X owes $200,000 to First National Bank (FNB). :*Mr. X's debt to FNB is secured by a first- priority mortgage lien on Mr. X's house, which has a fair market value of $150,000. :*Mr. X duly files a bankruptcy petition in Chapter 7. :*FNB duly files a proof of claim under 11 U.S.C. § 501; no objections are made to FNB's claim. Here, under § 506(a)(1), FNB would have an allowed secured claim of $150,000 and an allowed unsecured claim of $50,000. In common bankruptcy parlance, FNB's mortgage lien would be said to be \\"partially underwater,\\" and FNB itself would be said to be \\"undersecured.\\" To the extent that the amount of a creditor-lienor's claim exceeds the fair market value of the collateral property, that creditor's lien is said to be \\"underwater.\\" Insofar as an \\"underwater\\" lien is supported by some value in the collateral property, that lien is only partially underwater. A creditor-lienor with a partially underwater lien is said to be \\"undersecured.\\" See 4 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 506.03[4] (16th ed. 2015). Section 506(a) thus distinguishes between \\"secured claims\\" and \\"unsecured\\" claims based on the numeric relation between (A) the value of a creditor-lienor's interest in the estate's interest in the collateral property; and (B) the amount of that creditor-lienor's allowed claim.See 4 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 506.03[4] In common bankruptcy parlance, this same numeric relation is used to denominate a creditor-lienor's allowed claim as \\"oversecured,\\" \\"fully secured,\\" or \\"undersecured.\\"See, e.g., 4 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 506.03[4]. Denomination of creditor-lienors' allowed claims as oversecured, fully secured, or undersecured is often extended to denominate creditor-lienors themselves as such, e.g.—a creditor-lienor with an undersecured claim is an \\"undersecured creditor,\\" and so forth. E.g., Prof. John D. Ayer et al., What Every Secured Creditor (and Its Lawyer) Should Know About Chapter 11, in 31 (H. Slayton Dabney, Jr. & John W. Kibler eds., 2007) (\\"[A creditor-lienor] may be oversecured, fully secured, or undersecured.\\"). In a given case, the particular denomination used depends on the particular nature of that numeric relation.See, e.g., 4 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 506.03[4][b]; Prof. John D. Ayer et al., What Every Secured Creditor (and Its Lawyer) Should Know About Chapter 11, in 32-35. :Oversecured Claim ::A creditor-lienor's allowed claim is \\"oversecured\\" to the extent that the value of that creditor's interest in the estate's interest in the collateral property exceeds the amount of that creditor's allowed claim.E.g., 4 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 506.03[4]. :Fully Secured Claim ::A creditor-lienor's allowed claim is \\"fully secured\\" where the value of that creditor's interest in the estate's interest in the collateral property equals the amount of that creditor's allowed claim. :Undersecured Claim ::A creditor-lienor's allowed claim is \\"undersecured\\" to the extent that the value of that creditor's interest in the estate's interest in the collateral property is less than the amount of that creditor's allowed claim, but greater than zero. Dewsnup v. Timm Dewsnup v. Timm, 502 U.S. 410 (1992), presented the Supreme Court with its first occasion to interpret 11 U.S.C. § 506(d).. See, e.g., A.W. Bailey III, Note, Dewsnup v. Timm: Judicial Sleight of Hand in Statutory Construction of the Bankruptcy Code, (1993) (\\"Judicial Sleight of Hand\\") (\\"The Court used [Dewsnup] to settle a debate over contradictory attempts among the circuits to interpret sections 506(a) and 506(d) of the Bankruptcy Code.\\"). Specifically, Dewsnup presented the question whether § 506(d) allows a Chapter 7 debtor to avoid an undersecured creditor's lien on the debtor's realty to the extent that the amount of the claim secured by that lien exceeds the collateral realty's fair market value.See Dewsnup, 502 U.S. at 411-12. The avoidance of the unsecured portion of a partially underwater lien is frequently termed \\"strip down\\". See, e.g., Lawrence Ponoroff, Hey, The Sun Is Hot And The Water's Fine: Why Not Strip Off That Lien?, 13, 16 n.14 (2013) (\\"Why Not Strip Off That Lien?\\") (\\"'Strip down' occurs when an undersecured lien is bifurcated and the unsecured portion is avoided.\\"). Thus, the Supreme Court's framing of the question presented in Dewsnup: 502 U.S. at 411-12. See also Bailey, Judicial Sleight of Hand, at 319 (\\"The Court used [Dewsnup] to settle a debate over contradictory attempts among the circuits to interpret sections 506(a) and 506(d) of the Bankruptcy Code. The interpretive attempts applied to a Chapter 7 debtor's ability to \\"strip down\\" a creditor's lien on real property to the current value of the property.\\"); David G. Carlson, Bifurcation of Undersecured Claims in Bankruptcy, (1996) (\\"Bifurcation of Undersecured Claims\\") (\\"In Dewsnup v. Timm, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to unloose the Gordian knot of lien stripping.\\"). In Dewsnup, the Chapter 7 debtor's $120,000 debt to a creditor was secured by lien on certain of the debtor's realty, the fair market value of which was $39,000.Dewsnup, 502 U.S. at 412-13; In re Dewsnup, 87 Bankr. 676, 677 (Bankr. D. Utah 1987). See also Margaret Howard, Dewsnupping the Bankruptcy Code, (1992) (\\"Dewsnupping\\"). The debtor, invoking § 506(d), sought to void that lien to the extent that the creditor-lienor's $120,000 claim exceeded the collateral realty's $39,000 fair market value, thereby \\"stripping down\\" the creditor's lien to the value of the collateral realty.Dewsnup, 502 U.S. at 413. See also Howard, Dewsnupping, at 513-14. The Dewsnup Court held that § 506(d) does not permit a Chapter 7 debtor to \\"strip down\\" an undersecured creditor's lien on the debtor's realty to the fair market value of the collateral realty.Dewsnup, 502 U.S. at 417. See also Ponoroff, Why Not Strip Off That Lien?, at 16 (\\"The narrow holding of [Dewsnup] was that \\"strip down\\" of an undersecured claim is not permitted under § 506(d) in a chapter 7 case.\\"); Howard, Dewsnupping, at 513 (\\"[T]he U.S. Supreme Court held in Dewsnup v. Timm that Section 506(d) of the Bankruptcy Code does not enable a Chapter 7 debtor to void a lien on overencumbered real property to the extent that the amount of the outstanding debt exceeds the property's value.\\"). The Court concluded that the phrase \\"allowed secured claim\\" in § 506(d) meant an \\"allowed claim\\" of a creditor secured by a lien; that is, the phrase \\"allowed secured claim\\" did not have the same meaning in § 506(d) as in § 506(a)(1).See Dewsnup, 502 U.S. at 417. See also Ponoroff, Why Not Strip Off That Lien?, at 19; Margaret Howard, Secured Claims in Bankruptcy: An Essay on Missing the Point, (1994) (\\"Missing the Point\\"); Howard, Dewsnupping, at 516-17. In so concluding, the Court acknowledged the apparent logical infirmity in its construction of § 506(d), but observed that it was not \\"writing on a clean slate.\\"Dewsnup, 502 U.S. at 417 (\\"Were we writing on a clean slate, we might be inclined to agree with petitioner that the words \\"allowed secured claim\\" must take the same meaning in § 506(d) as in § 506(a).\\"). See also Adler, Creditor Rights, at 11-12. As support for that proposition, the Court cited \\"the pre-Code rule that liens pass through bankruptcy unaffected.\\"Dewsnup, 502 U.S. at 417. As to that rule, the Court observed, \\"[u]nder the [pre-Code] Bankruptcy Act of 1898, a lien on real property passed through bankruptcy unaffected,\\" and \\"[a]part from reorganization proceedings … no provision of the pre-Code statute permitted involuntary reduction of the amount of a creditor's lien for any reason other than payment on the debt.\\" Id. at 418-19. Because the Court found \\"ambiguity\\" in the text of § 506(d), the Court was \\"not convinced that Congress intended to depart from\\" that rule.Dewsnup, 502 U.S. at 417. See, e.g., Ponoroff, Why Not Strip Down That Lien?, at 19-20; Carlson, Bifurcation of Undersecured Claims, at 17-18. Thus, the Court's conclusion: the phrase \\"allowed secured claim\\" in § 506(d) means an \\"allowed claim\\" of a creditor secured by a lien. The Court's decision in Dewsnup was poorly received and has been subject to extensive criticism \\"from its inception.\\"Caulkett, 135 S. Ct. at 2000 n.† (the \\"dagger footnote\\"). See, e.g., Dewsnup, 502 U.S. at 435-36 (Scalia, J., dissenting); In re Woolsey, 696 F.3d 1266, 1273-74 (10th Cir. 2012) (charging that Dewsnup \\"warped the bankruptcy code's seemingly straight path into a crooked one.\\"); Carlson, Bifurcation of Undersecured Claims, passim; Adler, Creditor Rights, at 10-12; Newborn, Decline of Priority, passim; Howard, Dewsnupping, passim. For example, Justice Scalia's dissent in Dewsnup castigated the majority for \\"disregarding well-established and oft-repeated principles of statutory construction\\" and engaging in \\"'one-subsection-at-a- time' interpretation.\\"Dewsnup, 502 U.S. at 435 (Scalia, J., dissenting). And in Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association v. 203 North LaSalle Street Partnership, 526 U.S. 434 (1999), Justice Thomas criticized Dewsnup for \\"enshroud[ing] both the Courts of Appeals ... and Bankruptcy Courts\\" in \\"methodological confusion.\\" (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment). However, \\"[r]ight or wrong, the Dewsnuppian departure from the statute's plain language is the law.\\"In re Woolsey, 696 F.3d at 1274. =Caulkett: Facts; Proceedings Below; Question Presented= Facts The debtor, David B. Caulkett, had two mortgage liens on his house in Melbourne, Florida; Bank of America held the junior mortgage lien. In 2013, Caulkett filed a bankruptcy petition under Chapter 7 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida; at that time, the amount of the senior mortgage debt was greater than the fair market value of Caulkett's house.See Caulkett, 135 S. Ct. at 1998; Bank of Am., N.A. v. Caulkett, No. 6:14-cv-78-ORL-31, 2014 WL 7175386, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 14, 2014). Proceedings Below After filing in Chapter 7, Caulkett moved to void Bank of America's junior mortgage lien under § 506(d). The Bankruptcy Court granted Caulkett's motion, and Bank of America appealed. Both the District Court and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's order. Thereafter, Bank of America filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court, which the Court granted on November 17, 2014.Bank of Am., N.A. v. Caulkett, 135 S. Ct. 674 (2014). Question Presented Caulkett presented the question whether a Chapter 7 debtor may void a junior mortgage on the debtor's property under § 506(d) when the amount of the debt secured by the senior mortgage on that property exceeds the property's current value.Caulkett, 135 S. Ct. at 1998 (stating that \\"the question [is] whether a debtor in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding may void a junior mortgage under § 506(d) when the debt owed on a senior mortgage exceeds the present value of the property.\\") Opinion of the Court In Caulkett, the Court unanimously held that § 506(d) does not allow a Chapter 7 debtor to void a junior mortgage on the debtor's property when the amount of the debt secured by the senior mortgage on that property exceeds the property's current market value.See also Ferraioli, Dewsnup Lives, at § 2, ¶¶ 6-8; Markell, Loser's Lament, at ¶¶ 8-10. The Court-based this holding on its prior decision in Dewsnup, reasoning as follows: *Dewsnup held that the phrase \\"allowed secured claim\\" in § 506(d) means an \\"allowed claim\\" of a creditor secured by a lien on property. *Bank of America's claim against Caulkett was \\"allowed\\" under § 502. *Bank of America's allowed claim was secured by a lien on property; Bank of America held the junior mortgage on Caulkett's house. *Thus, Bank of America's junior mortgage lien on Caulkett's house could not be voided under § 506(d).Caulkett, 135 S. Ct. at 1999-2000. See also Ferraioli, Dewsnup Lives, at § 2, ¶¶ 6-8; Markell, Loser's Lament, at ¶¶ 8-10. Although the Court expressly acknowledged the logical infirmity in Dewsnup's reasoning, it declined to overrule Dewsnup; noting that Caulkett had not asked the Court to do so.Caulkett, 135 S. Ct. at 2000 n.† (the \\"dagger footnote\\") (\\"From its inception, [Dewsnup] has been the target of criticism....Despite this criticism, the debtors have repeatedly insisted that they are not asking us to overrule Dewsnup.\\").

Ct. at 1998 n.*. Having declined to overrule Dewsnup, the Court concluded that Dewsnup dictated only one result: Section 506(d) does not allow a Chapter 7 debtor to void a junior mortgage on the debtor's property when the amount of the debt secured by the senior mortgage on that property exceeds the property's current market value.Caulkett, 135 S. Ct. at 1999-2001. See also Ferraioli, Dewsnup Lives, at § 2, ¶¶ 6-8; Markell, Loser's Lament, at ¶¶ 8-10. Commentary and analysis Commentators on the Caulkett decision have at turns expressed bewilderment that the Caulkett Court declined to overrule Dewsnup and wariness as to heralding the long-term reign of Dewsnup and Caulkett.See, e.g., Ferraioli, Dewsnup Lives; Markell, Loser's Lament; G. Ray Warner, A Lien Strip Tease from the Supremes re: Bank of America, N.A. v. Caulkett Bankruptcy Litigation, (June 2, 2015), http://www.natlawreview.com/article/lien-strip-tease-supremes- re-bank-america-na-v-caulkett-bankruptcy-litigation (\\"A Lien Strip Tease\\") (\\"What is strange about Caulkett is that Justice Thomas, writing for the full Court, goes out of his way to criticize Dewsnup....Why not just overrule Dewsnup? That brings us to the strangest aspect of the opinion. Not once, not twice, but three times in the short seven-page opinion, Justice Thomas states that the debtors did not ask the Court to overrule Dewsnup.\\"); Richard E. Gottlieb, High Court Win Is No Cure-All For Subordinate-Lien Market, (June 2, 2015), http://www.law360.com/articles/662226/high-court-win-is-no-cure-all- for-subordinate-lien-market (\\"No Cure-All\\"). For example, one commentator has described it as \\"strange\\" that the Caulkett Court \\"went out of [its] way to criticize Dewsnup\\", yet declined to take the further step of overruling it.Warner, A Lien Strip Tease. And another has remarked, more generally, that \\"Caulkett has kept spectators baffled as to why it did not overrule Dewsnup\\".Ferraioli, Dewsnup Lives. At the same time, in light of the Caulkett Court's criticism of Dewsnup, other commentators have also questioned the long-term stability of Dewsnup's reign and thus—by extension—the future of Caulkett itself.See, e.g., Markell, Loser's Lament (\\"Does the dagger [foot]note signal that six justices are ready to put a knife through Dewsnup?\\"); Gottlieb, No Cure-All (as to the future of Caulkett, warning against \\"plac[ing] too much stock in the long-term sustainability of its precedential value, despite the unanimity of the court's opinion.\\"). Yet for the time being, Dewsnup and Caulkett are the law.

He is best known for improving life for Pittsburgh's African Americans and the poor through his long terms as president of the Pittsburgh Branch of the NAACP and his legal and civil work. He led a march on Duquesne Light to protest unfair hiring practices. This work resulted in the creation of training programs for African-Americans so that they could gain admission into trade unions. Byrd Brown used his education to promote equality rather than to gain wealth. \\"Pro bono was his middle name,\\" said former NAACP president Harvey Adams. He ran for Congress in 1970 and mayor of Pittsburgh in 1989. Reverend J. Van Alfred Winsett III noted that despite struggling with racism, Brown \\"carried himself with dignity, never with hatred.\\" Brown died at UPMC-Presbyterian hospital on May 3, 2001, from emphysema.  Early life and education  Brown was the only child of the prominent Wilhelmina Byrd Brown, a civil rights activist, and Homer S. Brown, Allegheny County's first black judge, and the founder and first president of the Pittsburgh NAACP, who served as president for 24 years, 1958-71. Byrd's mother, Wilhelmina Byrd Brown, dedicated 50 years of her life to public service. His grandfather, the Reverend William Roderick Brown, was a well- known Pittsburgh North Side preacher. Byrd's father, Homer Brown, was a member of the Pennsylvania legislature and wrote the Pennsylvania state Fair Employment Practices Act. Homor Brown created one of the first pieces of legislation in Pennsylvania that prohibited discrimination in public places. At that time, nine out of ten firms discriminated against race, religion, or national origin in the hiring of workers. Byrd Brown was raised in the affluent neighborhood called Sugar Top, in the Hill District of Pittsburgh. This district historically served as the center of African-American life in Pittsburgh in Allegheny County. The quality of life in the Hill and other Pittsburgh neighborhoods has been improved by redevelopment. But this progress often has been at the expense of African-Americans, forced out of their neighborhoods by inflating property values, redlining and other practices that promote gentrification. Brown was the first black student to start as quarterback for his high school football team. He was one of the first few black children to attend Camp Kon O'Kwee at the YMCA, and first Black counselor-in-training, but was never allowed to hold a counselor's position because of racial objections. He graduated from Schenley High School in 1947, and went on to earn a bachelor of arts degree (BA) and a law degree (JD) from Yale University in 1955. His Yale contemporaries included George H.W. Bush, William F. Buckley, and Pat Robertson. Brown served in the United States Army from 1954 to 1956.  Civil rights activism  Byrd Brown was a leader in the Civil Rights Movement and contemporary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.. Mayor Tom Murphy of Pittsburgh said, \\"Byrd Brown was an African-American who stood in the front lines of the civil rights movement and faced down enormous hatred and prejudice. It takes a rare kind of courage to be able to do that.\\" = Events organized = In the 1960s Brown helped to organize rallies at Forbes Field where King spoke. In 1963 he helped lead a train convoy to the March on Washington. In 1967 Brown organized and led a downtown march of 5,000 people at the company Duquesne Light to seek better jobs and protesting unfair hiring practices for African Americans. After the march, Duquesne Light began hiring African American workers. In 1968, Brown acted as co-chairman of the Spring Mobilization for Peace. In 1969 he became the principal speaker at Moratorium Day rally at Point Park in Pittsburgh. Brown also organized marches against Mine Safety Appliances, Gimbels, Kaufmann's, Hornes, the Pittsburgh Board of Education, Sears Roebuck, and the University of Pittsburgh. He picketed construction sites to push for more black jobs in construction. During one violent police confrontation, Brown suffered beatings and was sprayed with mace. Thanks to the efforts of Brown and other civil rights activists, the Pittsburgh Plan was produced. This plan was considered a national model for training blacks for construction jobs.  Black Monday  Byrd helped organize the Black Monday demonstration to U.S. Steel corporation's new building to protest discrimination in construction. = NAACP = Brown was president of the Pittsburgh NAACP from 1958 to 1971. = Pro bono and philanthropy work = Brown donated regularly and generously to a non-profit organization called Hand in Hand that gave college scholarships. City Councilman Sala Udin recalled the time while they were driving back to Pittsburgh from Mississippi in the 1960s the police stopped him and fellow civil rights workers. Officers arrested Udin and the others after they searched their car and found a pistol. Udin called Brown while stuck in jail. \\"Byrd came to Kentucky and got us out of jail,\\" Udin said Brown donated generously to college scholarships and non-profit organizations that assisted the poor and less fortunate. For instance, in the 1970s, when Warner Cable came to Pittsburgh, Brown arranged for local charities to receive company stock. According to the Reverend Leroy Patrick, pastor emeritus of Bethesda Presbyterian Church, his church received $300,000 for its stock when Warner Cable was later bought out.  Litigation  Former NAACP president Harvey Adams said of Brown, \\"Pro bono was his middle name,\\" \\"He did a thorough job whether the client had a nickel or nothing. He made them work to put a person in jail.\\" Brown filed successful civil rights litigation challenging perpetual racism in housing from the local Board of Realtors and represented Oswald Nickens, a black gynecologist who was prevented from buying a piece of property in Stanton Heights until his lawsuit.  Politics and later life  In 1970 Brown ran for the United States Congress, and in 1989 he ran for mayor of Pittsburgh. \\"run as a citizen and as a black man-in that order.\\" He ran for mayor on the slogan \\"Byrd is the word.\\" In 1991, Brown faced William Bradford Reynolds, a former U.S. Attorney General in a debate about affirmative action. Brown argued against Reynolds that affirmative action is \\"the kind of code word that is always used to keep [African Americans] in [their] place\\" and so it is no more discriminative than other active legislation.  Awards and honors  In 1989 Brown was awarded the Yale Club of Pittsburgh Distinguished Alumni Award which honors those who have helped to improve their community. This award had only been given to one person before Brown received it. In 1991, Brown gave the keynote address for the Alle-Kisi memorial service for Martin Luther King Jr.. Byrd Brown received the Drum Major for Justice Award from the Homer S. Brown Law Association in 2000 in honor of his civil rights activism. The association's president, Carl G. Cooper, said at a prayer breakfast at East Liberty's Mt. Ararat Baptist Church, \\"Byrd has fought (for civil rights) courageously and often single-handedly,\\" \\"He is a hero in this corner of the world.\\" Brown owned a private law practice in downtown Pittsburgh which was among the first black-owned businesses in the area. Brown was recognized in 1995 by the Allegheny Bar Association and by the Homer S. Brown Law Association for being one of the first 40 African American lawyers in the United States. In 2011, Brown was posthumously given the Spirit of King Award. \\"The Spirit of King Award celebrates the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and honors those who have carried his legacy throughout their lives,\\" said Eric Wells, assistant director, Employee Relations/OEO department of Port Authority. Brown shared King's spirit of dedication and perseverance throughout his life to achieve freedom and equality. This award honored Brown's impact on the region and the community, but it also gave an opportunity to show appreciation \\"for the sacrifices made in the past as a reminder for us to work together and continue the movement in the present, as well as the future,\\" said Chaz Kellum, Manager of Diversity Initiatives for the Pittsburgh Pirates.  Memberships  Byrd Brown a member of the NAACP, Pittsburgh chapter, as well as its president from 1958-71. He was a board member of the Pittsburgh Foundation; and a chair of the Freedom Unlimited as well as chair of the Health Advisory Council of Community Action Pittsburgh (CAP).

Speck, Tory & Whig: The Struggle in the Constituencies 1701-1715, (London, 1970), p.96. 'Church in Danger' was a rallying call for many Anglicans in England who feared that the established Church of England was under attack by the policies of the Whigs, particularly the Toleration Act 1688. The Act allowed freedom of worship to Nonconformists i.e., Protestants who dissented from the Church of England such as Baptists and Congregationalists but not to Catholics. Nonconformists were allowed their own places of worship and their own teachers, if they accepted certain oaths of allegiance. To Tory supporters and High Church Anglicans such as Dr. Henry Sacheverell, such toleration would ultimately undermine the established Church of England through reducing attendance and allowing sedition to be preached in England. The slogan proved to be effective and featured heavily in Tory election campaigns, particularly during the 1705 English general election which occurred in the midst of the Tackers controversy and the 1710 British general election where, in the context of the trial of Henry Sacheverell and the subsequent Sacheverell riots, the slogan contributed to a Tory landslide victoryJames Richards, Party Propaganda Under Queen Anne: The General Elections of 1702-1713, (Charlotte, 1972), p. 111. and enabled the passage of the Occasional Conformity Act 1711 to lock out non-conformists, though the act was repealed by the Whigs when they returned to power in 1719.Mark Knights, \\"Occasional conformity and the representation of dissent: hypocrisy, sincerity, moderation and zeal.\\" Parliamentary History 24#1 (2005): 41-57.

The title Jíjiùpiān uses the word piān 篇, which originally meant \\"bamboo strips used for writing (before the invention of paper)\\" and was semantically extended to \\"sheet (of paper/etc.); piece of writing; article; chapter; section; book\\". Several other Chinese dictionary titles use pian, for example, the (c. 500? BCE) Shizhoupian \\"Historian Zhou's Chapters\\", (c. 220 BCE) Cangjiepian \\"Cangjie's Chapters\\", (c. 543) Yupian \\"Jade Chapters\\", and (1066) Leipian \\"Categorized Chapters\\". Jíjiù has several possible interpretations, depending on the meanings of jí 急 \\"urgent; hurrying; rapid; fast; hasty; distress\\" and jiù 就 \\"proceed; advance; accomplish; achieve; accomplish; finish\\". The Science and Civilisation in China collaborators Joseph Needham, Lu Gwei-djen, and Huang Hsing-Tsung (1986: 194) say, \\"One hardly knows how to render its title, unless 'Handy Primer'.\\" Thomas Lee (2000: 437) translates jijiu as \\"quickly getting to\\". The Chinese lexicographers Heming Yong and Jing Peng (2008: 57) say that jijiu 急就 \\"instant success\\" suggested \\"fast learning\\", as seen in the first words of the Jijiupian preface. > Quickly learn the rarely seen drinking vessels and many different things: > listing the names of objects, people, and family names; classify them into > different sections so that they will not be easily mixed up. Occasional > consultation will definitely be a great delight—for it is quick to retrieve, > and, if hard effort is put into it, there will surely be surprising rewards. > Please follow the guidelines in each chapter. This passage is notably the earliest recorded discussion of how to classify characters into different textual sections (Yong and Peng 2008: 144). While the title is usually transliterated Jijiupian, Chi-chiu-p'ien, etc., some English translations are: *Handy Primer (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 562) *Quick Access [to Characters] (Theobald 2010) *Quick mastery of the characters (Wilkinson 2000: 49) *The Instant Primer (Yong and Peng 2008: 25) *Primer for Quickly Learning Chinese Characters (Cai 2013: 85) *For Urgent Use (Cheung and Lin 2014: n.p.) *Wood-Prism Bundles for Rapid Attainment (Barbieri-Low and Yates 2015: 1102) History Keio University Library The first reference to the Jijiupian and Shi You 史游 is found in the Yiwenzhi \\"Treatise on Literature\\" bibliographical section of the (111 CE) Hanshu \\"Book of Han\\", listed among early dictionaries: \\"In the time of Emperor Yuan of Han (r. 48-33 BCE), the court scholar Shi You composed the Jijiupian\\" (元帝时黄门令史游作急就篇). This section also uses the Jijiu title; Jijiu yipian 急就一篇 \\"The Jijiu, in one chapter\\" (tr. Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 194). In the Western Han dynasty (206 BCE-25 CE), the teaching of characters was emphasized, and scholars compiled other character primers and wordbooks besides the Jijiupian, for instance, the Fanjiangpian 凡將篇 The General Primer by Sima Xiangru (c. 179 – 117 BCE) and 32-7 BCE Yuanshangpian 元尚篇 The Yuanshang Primer by Li Zhang 李長, both of which are lost works (Creamer 1992: 112). These proto-dictionaries facilitated the development of Chinese xiǎoxué 小學 \\"minor learning; pre-modern 'linguistics'; philology\\" (which now means \\"primary school\\"), and laid the academic foundation for the compilation of wordbooks, vocabularies, and dictionaries (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 25). The Han dynasty experienced the transition of Chinese lexicography from wordlists and glossaries to character dictionaries and word dictionaries. The Jijiupian generalized the practice of logically classifying characters into different sections, which inspired the \\"macro- level stylistic format of the Chinese dictionary\\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 144). From the Han to the Six Dynasties (220-589), the most popular character textbook was the Jijiupian (Wilkinson 2000: 49). During the Northern and Southern dynasties (420-589), several other popular textbooks appeared, such as the Qianziwen \\"Thousand Characters Text\\", Baijiaxing \\"Myriad Family Surnames\\", and Sanzijing \\"Three-character Classic\\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 57). By the Tang, the Jijiupian had been replaced by the Qianziwen and Baijiaxing, both of which were deliberately written so that few characters they contain occur more than once. They were memorized generation after generation for over 1,000 years. In the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) and Qing dynasty (1644-1912), the most popular primer was the Sanzijing (Wilkinson 2000: 49). Contemporary Chinese scholarship admires the Jijiupian because of its high factual content as contrasted with the much more moralistic tendencies of similar later works such as the Sanzijing (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 195). The Jijiupian was one of several similar wordbooks that circulated widely during the Qin and Han periods, but it alone survived to the present day, owing to several factors. One reason for its preservation was a model version written by the famous Jin dynasty Chinese calligrapher Wang Xizhi (303–361), which was copied by generation after generation of literati eager to perfect their calligraphy (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 195). The Yuan dynasty calligrapher Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322) also produced an orthographic model Jijiupian. Another factor was the textual explanations written by famous authors in later dynasties. The Tang scholar Yan Shigu wrote a (620) commentary, and the Song scholar Wang Yinglin 王應麟 wrote the (1280) Xingshi Jijiupian 姓氏急就篇 (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 195). Modern archeological excavations have found fragments of the Jijiupian, and even some tablets on which the inscriptions were evidently exercises in copying characters (Loewe 1967 2: 418; Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 197). Text The original Jijiupian consisted of 32 sections (zhang 章), each with 63 Chinese characters, totaling 2,016. Some later editions of the text add two more sections, each with 64 characters, thus totaling 2,144. The text was designed to include as many different characters as possible, with little repetition, in order to maximize the student's exposure to and learning of new words. The text is described as a sort of abecedarium (Goodrich 1975: 220, Yates 2011: 358). The Jijiupian collation puts together characters written with the same radical or signific, and then divides them into chapters. Within each chapter, the style consisted mainly of 3-, 4-, or 7-syllable rhyming lines, as in Chinese poetry. Rhyme makes it easy to read, memorize, and recite (Yong and Peng 2008: 57). China's first \\"word books\\" were written to meet the needs of literacy education (Allan 2013: 212). Shi You's Jijiupian was intended to be used for learning the meanings of basic characters and how they should properly be written. It formed a basis for verbal elaborations by teachers, and could have served as a handy reference manual for scribes and copyists (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 195). The original Han edition Jijiupian was written in clerical script, but it was later used for learning to write in other calligraphic styles of characters, such as regular script and cursive script. The Jijiupian has historical linguistic value as a record of common words that were current during the Han dynasty. It preserved many technical terms and names of plants, animals, tools, and objects, which are important for the histories of science, medicine, and technology. For instance, the Jijiupian was the first text to describe the trip hammer and waterwheel. To illustrate the types of lists that the Jijiupian contains, and their value for those who wished to write correctly, consider the Section 24 list of traditional Chinese herbal medicines, written in rhymed 7-character lines (tr. Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 195). > 灸刺和药逐去邪 By moxa, acupuncture and the compounding of drugs we may drive out > the malign (qi that cause illness). (Of drugs and drug-plants there are:) > Huángqín 黄芩 Scutellaria lateriflora, fúlíng 伏苓 Wolfiporia cocos, yù 礜 > arsenolite, and cháihú 茈胡 Bupleurum falcatum. Mǔméng 牡蒙 Rubia yunnanensis, > gāncǎo 甘草 Glycyrrhiza glabra, wǎn 菀 Aster tataricus, and lílú 藜蘆 Veratrum > niqrum. Wūhuì 烏喙 and fùzǐ 附子 both Aconitum carmichaelii, jiāo 椒 , > Zanthoxylum piperitum, and yánhuá 芫花 Daphne genkwa. Bànxià 半夏 Pinellia > ternata, zàojiá 皂莢 Gleditsia sinensis, ài 艾 Artemisia argyi, and tuówú 橐吾 > Ligularia sibirica. The rhyme-words (Old Chinese reconstructions from Baxter-Sagart 2014) are: *sə.ɢa 邪, *ɡˁa 胡, *rˁa 蘆, *qʷʰˁra 花, and *ŋˁa 吾. With the exception of the mineral arsenolite (arsenic oxide), most of these names are written with the \\"plant radical\\" 艸 or 艹, which is commonly used in characters for plants and trees. The text \\"impresses readers with its balanced content and ingenuity\\" (Lee 2000: 437), and some examples are: > To buy on credit, to borrow, to sell and to buy, these activities give > convenience to merchants and markets….To cut, to mince, to broil and to cook > a whole piece of meat, each has its own shape….Rooms, houses, and inns are > [for people] to rest and there are also towers, palaces, and halls….Various > ranked lords have their fiefs, lands, and household vassals; these > [privileges] come from hard studies, but not from [the help of] ghosts or > spirits. (tr. Lee 2000: 438) The Jijiupian teaches students basic vocabulary for daily life, with occasional moral lessons.

The film portrays the events that occur in the life of Aruvi (Aditi Balan), a rebellious young woman who seeks to expose the consumerist and misogynistic nature of modern civilisation, while attempting to find meaning during a period of existential crisis. Aruvi was produced by Dream Warrior Pictures and was released globally on 15 December 2017. It was praised for the performances of the cast, especially of Balan and the film's direction.  Synopsis  A gentle girl born and brought up amidst the ever-growing eco-social-consumeristic environment finds it difficult to fit in the society. She decides to take it hard on the people. What she does is the rest of the story. Aruvi speaks about the social anguish of a girl.  Plot  The film begins with Aruvi (Aditi Balan) and Emily being interrogated by law enforcement officer Shakeel, who suspects Aruvi to be part of a terrorist organization. Aruvi's parents and friends are called for interrogation who talk about Aruvi's childhood and adolescence. She is a lovingly raised, innocent girl from a middle-class family. Things take a turn as her life when her family turns against and turns her out of the house accusing her of having brought shame to the family. Her college friend Jessy takes her in for a while, then moves to a hostel and lives with Emily, who is a transgender woman. They work for a man called Arulmani as tailors in an NGO. One day, she goes to Arulmani crying, asking for a loan of 1 lakh rupees, as her father has suffered a minor cardiac arrest. She then takes off and doesn't return. Occasionally, she undergoes touch therapy with a Swami who uses hypnosis to heal stress. Emily approaches the producers of \\"Solvathellam Sathyam,\\" a reality show that showcases people's problems on TV. She complains about three men who raped her friend Aruvi. The Assistant Director Peter (Pradeep Antony) agrees to telecast their problem and calls the three men for interrogation. Next morning, shooting starts as the host (Lakshmi Gopalaswamy) asks Aruvi to narrate what happened to her. Aruvi then explains that the three men are Jessy's father Joseph, Arulmani and the swamiji. Joseph had sexually abused her when she took shelter in his house. Arulmani had taken advantage of Aruvi's situation when she begged for a loan and the Swami had hypnotized and raped her. Aruvi then reveals that she has had AIDS for the past 2 years (which had occurred due to her getting infected through a wound in her mouth after an injury while having coconut water; the seller had inadvertently shed his blood into the straw while cutting open the coconut). She meets her friend Emily in an NGO as both of them have AIDS. Aruvi asks the three men to apologize, but Lakshmi turns against Aruvi, accusing her of intentionally infecting those men. Aruvi is appalled and states everything wrong with the society and the unnecessary stereotypes that every common man has to conform to, in order to fit into this consumeristic world. The director uses all this drama to his advantage as this would improve his show's TRP rating. Aruvi pulls out a gun and shoots the director in the arm. Later, she calms herself and apologizes to everyone, but as she gets up to leave, Arulmani tackles her and hits Emily. This maddens Aruvi and she starts hitting him with a rebar and takes everyone hostage, holding them at gunpoint. Aruvi then takes control and subjects the hostages to trivial games and activities; the main motive was to impress Aruvi and share others' feelings with each other, failing which Aruvi threatened to shoot them dead. The hostages abide by Aruvi's instructions and go with the activities. The sound of the commotions cause a wide public stir and police to surround the premises. Aruvi gets a call from officer Shakeel and she assures the safety of the hostages and her apprehension to him after a while. During the course of the game, everyone seems to get affected by the Stockholm Syndrome, and they become friendly with Aruvi. She even forgives the three men who raped her. Aruvi suffers a nosebleed by the time she surrenders to the police. Since Aruvi and Emily are AIDS patients, they cannot be arrested and have to be isolated inside the camp, Aruvi's condition continues to deteriorate as she loses a lot of weight and becomes incapable of taking care of herself. One night, she disappears from the camp and moves to a village all alone. After a few days, all of Aruvi's friends (the hostages) receive a video from Aruvi on Facebook. The video shows her crying and explaining how she misses everyone and speaks about all the regrets in her life. On seeing the video, Peter gathers everyone and takes them to the village in which Aruvi currently resides (an allusion to Peter's story that he narrated to Aruvi during the hostage situation). Aruvi is finally surrounded by everyone she loves towards the end of her lifetime. Everyone she loved gave her a lot of gifts like cakes, pictures and the like. Among such gifts is a card from Peter written \\" Love you forever Aruvi, Peter\\" which she saved as it touched her heart, eventually reciprocating his feelings (this too was a revisit of Peter's earlier proposal to Aruvi during the incident, albeit in a bland way before). Everyone cheer Aruvi up by playing the bottle game and having a great time with her to make the last few days of her life sweet and memorable. The movie ends with Peter capturing the image of Aruvi smiling.

His rugby career spanned the amateur and professional era. He played at Tighthead Prop. Amateur career He started playing rugby with amateur club Hillfoots RFC. Both Herrington and John Manson came through the clubs ranks at the same time. Herrington, Manson and 'Budgie' Cairney formed a front row partnership affectionately deemed the 'Tillicoultry Troglodytes'. From Hillfoots, Herrington moved to Dundee HSFP, along with Manson and Cairney. He was a key member of the Dundee squad and drove the club back into Scottish rugby's top amateur division. Herrington's impeccable technique in the scrum was such that Scotland's then Director of Rugby Jim Telfer asked him to pass on his knowledge to younger props. He mentored youngsters in the Dundee team - most notably young prop Tom Smith, who was later to become a British and Irish Lions player. Smith was to say of his mentoring: \\"When I joined my first senior club in Dundee, there was an old prop called Danny Herrington, a bit of a local legend, who basically shoved my head up my arse in training, twice a week every week for what seemed like years. Now, that's what you call a learning curve. Those training sessions were my classroom. Danny took the view that a young prop should have his share of bad experiences before trying to inflict them on other people.\\" He would later move to play for Kirkcaldy RFC. Provincial and professional career =North and Midlands= He first played for the amateur district North and Midlands in 1990. =Caledonia Reds= When Scotland took on the challenges of the professional game, this district became Caledonia Reds in season 1996-97. Herrington also represented this professional provincial side. Danny won the Scottish Inter-District Championship with Caledonia Reds in 1996-97 season. It was the first Inter- District championship that North and Midlands or Caledonia Reds had won outright and qualified Caledonia Reds to the Heineken Cup. =Glasgow Warriors= Caledonia Reds folded in 1998 as the SRU cost cut. However Danny's days as a professional player were not yet over. In 2000, he answered Richie Dixon's injury problems by turning out for Glasgow Warriors, then known as Glasgow Caledonians. He made an appearance from the bench against Bridgend RFC and started against Neath RFC in Welsh-Scottish League matches towards the end of 1999-2000 season. He made his Warriors debut at 39 years old and was a grandfather. From his date of birth to 12 February 2000 is 39 years 5 months and 18 days on Warriors debut; and his last Warriors appearance he was aged 39 years 8 months and 18 days; currently the record for Warriors oldest ever player. International career It was while Herrington was with Dundee that he received his caps for Scotland A. He received 3 'A' caps in all:- against the All Blacks in 1993; in the victory over France A in Rennes in 1994 and the narrow loss to France A in 1995. Tributes Herrington died on 26 May 2005 after a long battle with cancer, aged 44 years old. The manager of Caledonia Reds, Ian Rankin, called Danny 'Mr Indestructible'. He told the story of the time when 'Mr Indestructible' met 'The Fun Bus' causing not much fun at all for the English prop. This was in a European match against Harlequins, Danny had the then world's most capped player Jason Leonard 'squealing' in the scrums. John Manson gave this tribute to his former teammate: \\"Danny is undoubtedly one of those who was unlucky not to play for Scotland, \\" he said. \\"He was probably underrated because he didn't necessarily look the part, but the strength he had from being a manual worker made him particularly powerful and made him seem almost indestructible.\\" References Category:1960 births Category:Glasgow Warriors players Category:Caledonia Reds players Category:Kirkcaldy RFC players Category:Dundee HSFP players Category:2005 deaths Category:Rugby union props Category:North and Midlands players Category:Scotland 'A' international rugby union players Category:Hillfoots players ","title":"Danny Herrington"},{"id":"49431209","text":"Avery Raymond Kier (February 11, 1905 – August 7, 1987) was a United States Marine Corps aviator and general officer.

The work is considered Reni's fresco masterpiece. Aurora fresco Casino dell'Aurora The casino and the paintings were commissioned by the Cardinal Scipione Borghese, a prominent art patron, and designed by Giorgio Vasanzio and Carlo Maderno, and the rear overlooks the Piazza del Quirinale in Rome. The facade is towards the small garden next to the palace. On the walls of the room are four frescoes of the Seasons by Paul Bril, and two Triumphs by Antonio Tempesta. The Aurora fresco The ceiling fresco is tall and wide. It is displayed within a painted frame or quadro riportato and depicts from right to left, Aurora (Dawn) in a golden billowing dress with her garlands flies over a dim-lit landscape, leading a blond Apollo in his horse-drawn chariot, surrounded by a chain of female \\"hours\\", bringing light to the world. It could also be described as the Triumph of Apollo led by the Aurora. Above the quadriga, in the sky, flies the putto Phosphorus with a torch. Zephyrs blow winds at either end. One interpretation of the work is that the incorporated heraldic symbols were meant to link the patron Scipione with Apollo, his patronage bringing \\"light to the darkness.\\" It may have served to uphold the ravenous Borghese accumulation of classical antiquities. The style of the work is classically restrained and mimics poses from ancient Roman sarcophagi, that were on display in the cardinal's collection. Others have noted how the painting echoes in part a bas-relief at the Arch of Constantine showing Apollo in a Quadriga with Phosphorus.Essay on Aurora fresco, by Dr. Shannon Pritchard. The chariot procession recalls the central fresco in The Loves of the Gods, painted by Annibale Carracci in the Farnese Palace, which depicts the Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne; however, here there is far more classical sobriety in a restricted number of figures, with little emotion, without overemphasizing muscular anatomy, and hearkening beyond mannerism back to a high-renaissance restraint. The quadriga prances in unison; the maiden hours gambol at a placid pace. There is little attention to perspective, and if anything the vibrantly colored style is an affront to the violence and tenebrism displayed by Caravaggio and his followers, despite this being a pavilion commissioned by one of Caravaggio's early patrons, Scipione Borghese. It is unclear how the fresco relates to the paintings on the walls by Paolo Brill. On the other hand, the contemporary frescoes by Antonio Tempesta also depict triumphs: on the right a Roman general in a triumph and crowned by winged Victory. On the left, a Triumph of Love.Casino Aurora of Palazzo Pallavicini, official site.

Ashford hospital with diabetes Ashford hospital cooperated with Australian Diabetes Society-Servicer to evaluate a certain connection between female who have had gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and form type 2 diabetes. July 2002, Ashford joined GDM research, until June 2009, there are 817 women taking part in long-term inspection. 68.4% in 2002 and 64.4% in 2007 had the first reminder to notice glucose level, 56.3% in 2009 had a diabetes test. As for the results, there was an increasing tend to be having type 2 diabetes as time longer. As a consequence, Ashford hospital had series of earlier glucose test for GDM patients, especially 6th week to 3rd month after giving birth. GDM is a general problem, as 4.9% gestational women in South Australia had diabetes in 2007. And there a high proportion to acquire type 2 diabetes, which will be obesity and have risk to children. Resistance to insulin have a tend to accumulate glucose and lead to fat. (Sally.et.al Aust N Z J Obstet Gynaecol) Ashford diabetes centre provided a stage to take this long-term follow-up research, and also helped thousands of pregnant females avoid diabetes. Although there are series examinations about glucose and type 2 diabetes until now, Ashford centre scientists have guides to families, which have new babies. Keeping a regular and healthy diet with proper exercise is critical to those who has gestational diabetes mellitus. (Catherine, et.al Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology) Flinders Private Hospital: As Adelaide’s the third famous hospital in southern district, Flinders Private Hospital (FPH) is at the cutting-edge of innovative Cardiac Cure in South parts. FPH cardiac equipment regularly to ensure a number of interventional life-saving steps.

An investigation about cardiac disorder: depression and anxious in surgery patients was carried out in Flinders Private Hospital from Feb.2007 to March 2009, lasting approximate two years. The specialists tested negative active (NA) and Type D level with anxious symptoms questionnaire. There are 158 patients with 36-87 years who had cardiac surgery before, containing 4 aspects: hearing, listening, speaking and hearing. The result was appeared clearly, morbidity reactions are tightly associated with affective phenotypes, disorders and Type D treatment methods. The study is based on psychological theories and clinical data, confirming an imagination of Trait NA and the GAD are efficient in depression or anxiety disorder therapy. (Phillip J. Tully et al. Cardiac morbidity risk and depression and anxiety: A disorder, symptom and trait analysis among cardiac surgery patients). In future treatment, Trait NA significantly influence in morbidity risk after cardiovascular surgery. Also, increasing clinical cure methods be applied in surgery and type D symptom in Flinders Private Hospital.

Using last 3 days dietary mass diary and signed up with biomarkers to identify iron, zinc and vitamin B12, glucose and fatty acid level. The result shows 1-5year old kids in Adelaide have a normal energy intake, within recommend range. Carbohydrate takes up 50%, fat, protein takes 33% and 17% respectively, which can maintain children’s daily consumption. However, data for calcium, iron, zine and vitamin B C are lower than standard. It shows a tendency to have a risk having anemia, dysplasia problems. Only a minority of pre-school kids achieved the sufficient intake for n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (32%) and dietary fibre (18%). When children who lack cellulose or mineral elements growing up, there have a high chance gaining kings of diseases about intestine and stomach. A lower intake of cellulose and n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and high amount of saturated fat intakes have increased concerns that this dietary pattern may be related to adverse long-term health effects. As absorb and the BMI value is raising, which means a higher weight leads to obesity. Specialists strongly make suggestions that kids and their parents notice daily diet, balance sugar, vegetable and meat’s intake.

She became involved in women's suffrage as an empowerment for women's civic clubs. In 1922 she ran against an incumbent politician for election to the United States Senate, a campaign which inspired her to organize women's groups to call for world disarmament. Early life She was born November 9, 1865 in Winneshiek County, Iowa to wealthy businessman David Jack, and tutored by a governess. In later life, she would recall her father's fortitude during a business financial crisis, \\"If ever I feel discouraged, my father's indomitable qualities come to mind and shame me.\\" Women's suffrage In 1888, she married Oshkosh, Wisconsin attorney Ben Hooper who encouraged her civic interests. When Hooper and her young daughter attended the 1893 International Conference for Women in Chicago they listened to a speech by Susan B. Anthony. It was not until 1908 that Hooper held an elected position with any civic organization, and even then attempted to shy away from the responsibility when her husband encouraged her nomination to fill a vacancy within the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. In spite of her reluctance, she won the election handily and subsequently held many positions in what were considered \\"women's clubs\\" of the day. Her earliest efforts were concentrated on improving health care options and facilities where none existed. She found such endeavors to be uphill efforts, with men becoming involved only after her efforts saw success. She began pursuing suffragist goals in earnest, spending time in Washington D.C. where she shared housing with nationally known suffragists. At the behest of National American Women's Suffrage Association (NAWSA) president Carrie Chapman Catt, Hooper and Minnie Fisher Cunningham toured Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah in 1919 and 1920 pressuring governors to call a special session to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.McArthur, Smith (2003), pp. 85–86 After ratification of the Amendment in 1920, NAWSA became the League of Women Voters. In Wisconsin the league's chapter carried the maxim \\"every woman an intelligent voter\\", and Hooper served two terms as its first president.Thomas, Schultz, Van Assendelft (1999), p. 111 U.S. Senate campaign The state Democratic Party nominated Hooper in 1922 to run for the United States Senate against the Republican incumbent Robert M. La Follette Sr.Martin (1999), p. 31 Her campaign was run by two women, Livia Peshkova and Gertrude Watkins, bolstered by women in the press, and often hosted in family living rooms. The campaign rallying cry became \\"Whoop for Hooper.\\" Her election platform championed the League of Nations, veterans compensation, and world peace. By this point in time, she was a grandmother and unpaid secretary and partner in her husband's business. He was one of only two men who donated any money to her campaign. Peace activist The Jessie Jack Hooper House Hooper's efforts for world peace had begun to surface in her women's clubs speeches with the onset of World War I, when she expressed a firm resolve to end all wars. Although she lost the 1922 election 78,029 votes to La Follette's 279,484 votes, the experience spurred her determination to recruit women for peace activism. Hooper invited 115 women nationwide to a 1924 brainstorming session, which eventually created the Conference on the Cause and Cure of War, a group that subsequently convened for several years. Elected to head the Department of International Relations of Women's Clubs, and the Wisconsin League of Women Voters' Committee for International Cooperation to Prevent War, she approached with zeal an effort to gather a million signatures for military disarmament. She took the cause of peace on the road, speaking to audiences across the country and on the radio, and writing newspaper columns. The effort fell short, with 635,300 signatures actually gathered. Hooper was selected in 1932 to present the aggregate petitions to the World Disarmament Conference in Geneva, Switzerland. Hooper continued to work for peace after her return from Switzerland. In 1934 she was hospitalized, and returned home to live an only few more months. On May 7, 1935, Hooper died. The Jessie Jack Hooper House in Oshkosh, Wisconsin was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

Description The name Viksjö is the oldest known writing coated, place name in Järfälla. On a rune, which now stands in the park at Jakobsberg's folk highschool, it is written that \\"Knut in Vikhusum (Viksjö) did raise up the stone and make the bridge after his father and mother and his brothers and (his) sister”. It got its present location in the park in 1920. The stone has the designation U92, Upplands inscriptions 92. The inscription on the stone at Jakobsberg's folk highschool reveals that Vikhusum , which is the older term for Viksjö, was inhabited as early as during the Viking Age. The rune stone is very simple without a shred of the animal ornamentation that is otherwise so common in the Uppland rune stones. Already in the 1700s this runestone was moved from its original location in the Vibble Järfälla parish. Vibble is the name of a number of a now long-lost buildings, on whose land Jakobsberg's Manor later were built. The farm place was situated on the west side of Kvarnbacken and approximately at the place where Kvarnskolan now stands. Vibble was first mentioned in 1347, but the farm has undoubtedly been established during the Late Iron Age. On Vibble's estate was originally the two rune stones U91 and U92, which today is in the park to Jakobsberg's folk highschool. In the 1600s the runestone was moved together with U 91 (Uppland Runic Inscription 91) in Wibbla Giärde. Both of whose traditional name is Viblestenarna has probably worked as breast unite in a stream. The stones are then moved several times and U 92 included the gatepost. It received its present location in the park at Jakobsberg's folk highschool in the 1920th. The last time the stone was painted was in September 2012 by the National Heritage.

Older archaeological researcher in Järfälla 17th century drawing by the Swedish archaeological researcher Johan Hadorph (1630-1693) and the draughtsman and land surveyor Johan Leitz (died 1738) in 1682. Johan Hadorph (1630-1693), lithograph from 1849. The archaeological researcher Johan Hadorph (1630-1793) was the driving force in College of Antiquaries (Swedish: Antikvitetskollegiet) in Uppsala. Moreover, Johan Hadorph was the college's secretary. He was also the initiator of the, a kind of archaeological inventory, where priests and the sheriff was asked to submit reports on the relics that were found in the different parts of the country. He was also the \\"first Swedish archaeologist,\\" according to Name Board (NB) and he undertook in the 1680s the first scientific study of Björkö in Ekerö Municipality, known as Birka. On Hadorph's initiative the Searching for Antiquity was carried out during the years 1667-1693. These reports formed the basis for Hadorphs antiquarian trips. Parishes that were ransacked were Bromma, Spånga and Järfälla Municipality in Gierfella d. 9 Maij 1682 by the County Administrator Bertold Dalhollm. In Dalhollms list there is mentioned six inscriptions of Järfälla and also an otherwise unknown rune stone at Yttersten. The six runic inscriptions mentioned are U86, U88, U89, U90, U91 and U92. The Searching for Antiquity is kept in the National Library of Sweden in Stockholm, but is also published in print form. The College of Antiquaries in Uppsala was founded in 1667 on the initiative of Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie. Several of scholars of that time were attached to the college. These included Georg Stiernhielm, Johan Axehiälm, Olaus Verelius, Johannes Loccenius, Johannes Schefferus and Magnus Celsius. To the tasks of the college was to develop a Swedish Dictionary, to publish Icelandic sagas and Swedish medieval laws. To the college's duties also heard to depict rune stones, coins and seals and to carrying out archaeological investigations.Magnus Källström, Järfällas runstenar, 1998, page 12-13. . In the summer of 1682 Johan Hadorph travelled together with the draughtsman Johan Leitz through Järfälla and mapped all the inscriptions that had been mentioned in Searching for Antiquity with the exception of the rune stone at the front way, that probably never existed. Hadorph additionally discovered a previously unknown rune at Järfälla church (U82). Johan Hadorph's Travelling Journal or Scribbling pad Notes from 1682 has been preserved and is now in the National Library of Sweden (Swedish: Kungliga biblioteket, KB, meaning \\"the Royal Library\\"). Among Järfälla runic inscriptions, however, Hadorph here only listed one of the rune stones at Skälby (U89). From the drawings of Hadorph's trips there were made woodcuts. These woodcuts should be part of a work with all of the country's rune stones. Hadorph could issue only a small part of this planned work of the rune stones (Färentuna Häradz Runstenar, 1680).

With easily accessible trails, the area has become a popular destination. The area is part of the Mountain Lake Wilderness Cluster. Location and access Boundary of the Cascades (conservation area) as identified by the Wilderness Society The Cascades Conservation Area is located in the Appalachian Mountains in Giles County near Pembroke, Va. The area is bounded on the north by Pacers Gap Road (SR 714), on the west by Butt Mountain and on the south and east by Doe Mountain. The trailhead for the hike to the Cascades waterfall is about 4 miles from Pembroke on a well maintained road. The Forest Service collects a fee for parking at the trailhead. On weekends, there may be a wait required before entering the parking area. Driving directions to the trailhead are given below in the external link. A second popular destination is Barney’s Wall, a tall cliff that gives a commanding view of the area. This trailhead is about 34 miles from Pembroke. However, the last part of the route is on a dirt road that can be difficult to manage for cars with a low suspension. Driving directions are given in the external link. Roads and trails are shown on National Geographic Trail Map 788. Natural history Little Stony CreekThe habitat of the southern Appalachians is rich in its biological diversity with nearly 10,000 species, some not found anywhere else. The great diversity is related to the many ridges and valleys which form isolated communities in which species evolve separately from one another. The region lies south of the glaciers that covered North America 11,000 years go. To escape the glaciers, northern species retreated south to find refuge in the southern Appalachians. When the glaciers retreated, many of these species remained along with the southern species that were native to the area. The diversity includes trees, mosses, millipedes and salamanders. Among interesting plants in the area are the walking fern and Jeffersonian twin-leaf. Walking fern (asplenium rhizophyllum) is a small fern with long, narrow tips that can touch the ground, then root to give a walking appearance. Jeffersonian twin-leaf (Jeffersonia diphylla) has showy white flowers that emerge with the spring ephemerals before the forest canopy appears and blocks sunlight to the forest floor. Little Stony Creek is eligible for designation as a Wild and Scenic River.Land and Resource Management Plan, Jefferson National Forest, Management Bulletin R8-MB 115A, January 2004, page 2-44 The area has 445 acres of potential old growth forest. Topography The Cascades Conservation Area is in the Ridge and Valley Province of the Appalachian Mountains. The province consists of a thick layer of sedimentary rock that has undergone folding and/or faulting to create a series of ridges and valleys. During the sedimentation process fossils were formed leaving evidence of life existing millions of years ago. The fossils can be seen in rock exposures throughout the mountains. Forest Service management The U.S. Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine their potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. The Cascades Conservation Area was not included in the inventoried roadless areas, and therefore subject to possible road construction and timber sales.

The Act was necessitated by the complicated landscape of competing water rights doctrines, demands for reclamation and irrigation, and tension between large landowners and smaller farmers all in the context of California's unique climate and topography. The State Water Commission created by the Act was given the responsibility of permitting and licensing water appropriators post-1914, but had no authority over pre-1914 claims. Ultimately the Act improved the recording of water rights but was inadequate to supervise the distribution of water and left many unresolved issues.  Challenges to water availability in California  Most precipitation in California falls north of the Transverse Ranges, creating a spatial discontinuity in water availability. Though much of the state receives ample precipitation, there are several important spatial and temporal issues complicating the distribution of water. Due to the state's predominantly Mediterranean climate regime, precipitation is nearly entirely confined to the months between October and April, meaning that water sources can be intermittent from year to year. Furthermore the extremely fertile agricultural regions of the San Joaquin Valley and Southern California receive relatively little precipitation, while the coastal urban nexuses of Los Angeles and San Francisco receive adequate precipitation but lack storage capacity. Finally, the broad floodplains of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers require extensive hydrological engineering in order to be converted to agricultural land and to prevent flooding. In this environment clarity of water rights and fairness in distribution are essential, but competing rights doctrines and a system of adjudication based entirely on litigation defeated attempts to formally codify water rights. = Gold Rush, statehood, and competing water doctrines = The discovery of gold by John Marshall at Sutter's Mill and the annexation of the California territory by the United States prompted a mass migration to the region. The new settlers brought with them Old World and East Coast attitudes toward water, but the realities of gold extraction in the Mother Lode region required a different standard. The result was the emergence of the riparian water right, derived from English common law, and the right of first appropriation, derived from the frontier ethic of \\"first in time, first in right.\\" Both doctrines were upheld at various times by the state legislature and court, creating a situation in which competing water claims could only appeal to the courts for resolution. = Riparian rights, appropriative rights, and the California doctrine = Adapted from English common law, the riparian water right dictated that landholders bordering on or encompassing streams had the reasonable use of the water that flowed over their property. This water right was well adapted to temperate climates with year-round rainfall, but proved ill-fitting for California's more arid climate. This standard brought riparian rights-holders into conflict in low-water years, creating issues of both priority and quantity which could only be settled in court. Furthermore the riparian right allowed for the monopolization of water rights by buying all the land adjacent to a stream, creating a conflict between large landholders with the means to buy up stream-adjacent land, and those who needed water rights in order to run profitable farms. The appropriative right, on the other hand, was an ad hoc invention of miners in the Mother Lode region, adapted specifically to the realities of gold extraction. The organizing principle of \\"first in time, first in right\\" served miners whose gold claims could be miles or tens of miles from running water, while the organization of miners' courts provided a mechanism to settle disputes. Under the appropriative right, entitlement to water proceeded from its actual use, as opposed to the riparian right in which water rights are retained regardless of use, and could be sold or transferred. The California Doctrine of water law, established in the California Supreme Court ruling over Lux v. Haggin attempted to blend the two doctrines by endorsing the riparian right as the law of the land, but outlining the circumstances under which the appropriative right could be held as superior. Under Lux v. Haggin, all private lands as well as public lands upon transfer to private ownership held riparian rights, but first priority could be given to an appropriator if the appropriative right had been established before riparian rights. = Prior legislation = The legislature of California made several attempts in the second half of the 19th century to address issues related to reclamation, flooding, and the equitable distribution of newly-privatized land. Major legislation of the period included the Reclamation of Swampland Act of 1861, the Green Act of 1868, and the Wright Act of 1887. While these three acts represented different methods of dealing with California's particular water woes, they all proved inadequate. Insufficient flood control was one of many major issues with water management in California, leading to the flooding of the state's capital in 1862. The Reclamation of Swampland Act of 1861 was the first attempt to address issues of flooding and reclamation by creating a centralized plan to drain and convert the Central Valley into agricultural land. To accomplish this the Act created the state's first independent agency in the Board of Swampland Commissioners, whose job was to design and administer a valley-wide flood plan, and authorized the creation of swampland districts. Lacking a complete understanding of the task they were undertaking however, the engineers failed to erect adequate levee systems and saw what work had been accomplished washed away by floodwaters. This failed experiment in top-down regulation reinforced public attitudes favoring laissez faire principles of management. The Green Act of 1868 embodied this newfound commitment to hands- off governance. The Act allowed private enterprise to purchase tracts and erect levees or drainage without consultation with any governmental body and also removed all restriction on the amount of land which could be purchased at one time while the price of swamp land at $1 per acre. While the legislature hoped that the Act would encourage creation of small, irrigated farms, the actual result was to concentrate land in the hands of a few individuals, with a legislative investigation revealing a list of 30 individuals having acquired nearly a quarter of the state's two million acres of swamp land. The Wright Act of 1887 attempted to put the balance of power back into the hands of small landholders by organizing self-governing irrigation districts. These irrigation districts were intended to act as a special government controlled by the community and having the power to break up large landholdings. The legislation had some measurable effect on average farm size, reflecting some limited breakup of large estates, but at the turn of the century 62% of agricultural land was covered in ownerships exceeding 1,000 acres. Ultimately irrigation districts were inadequate to effectively administer land and water rights because they relied on costly litigation to settle disputes. This along with a panoply of other shortcomings resulted in the Wright Act being viewed by California citizens as a failure.  Water Commission Act  Though the period following the passage of the Wright Act did coincide with a vast expansion of irrigated land in the Central Valley it was inadequate to significantly curb the threat of flooding, break up land monopolies, or address the growing concern of municipal water supplies. These issues would become a cornerstone of the platform of Progressive gubernatorial candidate Hiram Johnson who proposed a new water code to protect municipal water supplies and create a state water commission with the primary objective of ending litigation over water claims. To this end the Water Commission Act was submitted to the voters via referendum and approved in 1914. The Act invested in the newly-created State Water Commission the power to adjudicate disputes and issue permits for new appropriations of water. Concurrently, issues relating to reclamation and the construction of water infrastructure devolved to the newly formed Board of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. = Shortcomings of the Water Commission = The Water Commission Act was immediately attacked by water and power companies on the basis that it would impede enterprise and create a \\"political\\" commission. Court challenges as well as insufficient funding and authority hamstrung the Commission. Furthermore the Water Commission was fundamentally hobbled in its inability to adjudicate water rights prior to 1914, as the agency was only invested with the ability to permit appropriators after 1914, leaving the vast majority of water rights conflicts unresolved. Reports issued once every two years by the Commission highlighted issues faced by the agency related to lack of clarity in the procedures for statutory adjudication and lack of power to supervise distribution of water.

As Kampfgruppe 5 of the German invasion force proceeded towards Oslo, it encountered Norwegian defences in the Oslofjord. During a short exchange that resulted in the first Norwegian casualty of the war, the Germans managed to push through down to Drøbak Sound, where they would face more determined resistance.  Prelude  A portion of Rauøy fort, part of the greater Oslofjord Fortress, overlooking the fjord In order to invade Norway, the Germans divided their naval forces into six groups. The fifth of these, \\"Kampfgruppe 5,\\" was to pass through the Oslofjord and land troops in Oslo. The group consisted of the heavy cruisers and Lützow, the light cruiser , the torpedo boat , and eight minesweepers. The ships were under orders not to open fire unless fired upon. The outer parts of the fjord were guarded by the Oslofjord Fortress, established in 1914, made up of smaller forts at Bolærne and Rauøy. Of the 11 guard ships operating out of Tønsberg, would be tasked with patrolling the Oslofjord on the night of 8 April. Requisitioned by the Norwegian Navy in 1939, Pol III was armed with a gun and two machine guns. The ship had a crew of 15, including its commander Captain Leif Welding-Olsen.  Action  Shortly after 23:00 on 8 April, Lieutenant Hans Bergan of Pol III spotted the anonymous invasion force at the mouth of the Oslofjord. The patrol boat fired a warning shot, and closed with the German torpedo boat Albatros. Admiral Oskar Kummetz, having seen the patrol boat to his ships' port sides, ordered Albatros to intercept it. Captain Leif Welding-Olsen of Pol III had a short conversation with the commander of the German boat, Kapitanleutnänt Siegfried Strelow, who demanded his surrender, to which he refused. Realizing that Norwegian neutrality was going to be violated, Olsen radioed a warning to Horten Naval Base: \\"Alien ships incoming at high speed,\\"Pearson, Robert Gold Run: The Rescue of Norway's Gold Bullion from the Nazis, 1940 p. 22 fired flares for their coastal artillery (one white, two red,Forsvarets museer. Da Pol III møtte overmakten 8.april 1940 (in Norwegian) meaning \\"Enemy ships are forcing the line.\\"), then ordered Pol III to ram Albatros. Having just been rammed and seeing the guns manned on the patrol boat, Strelow ordered his ship's anti-aircraft batteries to open fire on the Norwegian ship. Captain Olsen was struck in the leg by machine gun fire and the ship was set ablaze. The order was given to abandon ship. The lifeboat was lowered into the water but overturned, so the crew was forced to cling to its sides. Weakened by blood loss, Olsen let go and drowned, becoming the first Norwegian casualty of the war. The surviving 14 crew were picked up by the invasion force and held captive. At 23:30, Kampfgruppe 5 was spotted by Rauøy fort's searchlight. The southern battery of the fort fired two warning shots. At 23:32, Bolærne fort fired a single warning shot. At 23:35, Rauøy fort targeted the cruiser Blücher and fired four live rounds, but missed due to poor visibility. Shortly thereafter the ships disappeared from view in the mist, and contact was lost.  Aftermath  Fire and battle damage inflicted on Pol III The Germans proceeded down the fjord towards Oslo. Rauøy forwarded Captain Oslen's original warning down to Oscarsborg Fortress, which was able to halt the Germans in the Battle of Drøbak Sound. Minesweepers detached from the main force would land troops in the area the next morning, and the Norwegians would withdraw from their forts over the next few days. Following Oscarsbourg's capitulation, the remainder of Kampfgruppe 5 would land in Oslo on 10 April. After signing an oath of non-belligerence, the captive Norwegians were released and allowed to return home. HNoMS Pol III was left burning and adrift overnight. It rained and the fire burnt out on its own. The next morning the ship was discovered by the Norwegian patrol boat Skudd 2, and towed to Tønsberg, where it would be captured by the Germans.D/S Pol III (Norwegian Homefleet - WW II)  References   External links  Category:Naval battles of World War II involving Germany Category:Naval battles of World War II involving Norway Category:1940 in Norway Category:1940s in Oslo Category:Norwegian campaign Category:April 1940 events ","title":"Action in the Oslofjord"},{"id":"49432171","text":"Hookers Hot Springs is a populated place in Cochise County, Arizona, United States. The settlement is located in the southern foothills of the Galiuro Mountains, and has been described as \\"beautifully situated, commanding an extended view of valley and mountain scenery\\". Several hot springs are located near the settlement, and the water is reputed to have health benefits. History A ranch on which Hookers Hot Springs is located was established in the 1860s. In 1905, author Joseph Amasa Munk described how the spring water was \\"conducted through pipes into the bath house, where it supplies a row of bath-tubs with water of any desired temperature\\". Visitors would bathe in the spring water, or drink it for its reputed benefits. Muck described how \\"locally, these springs have become famous because of the remarkable cures they have effected\\". The settlement is now located on the Muleshoe Ranch, and is co-managed by The Nature Conservancy, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Coronado National Forest.

It is a low, spreading shrub with grey leaves, flowers a shade of pink or purple, common in central areas of Western Australia. Description Eremophila margarethae is a spreading shrub, with branches and leaves covered with fine grey or yellowish branched hairs, usually growing to a height of less than . The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and are thick, especially near the edges, linear to lance-shaped, mostly long and wide. The leaves develop a coating of resin as they age which often obscures the individual hairs. The mid-rib is prominent on the lower surface and appears as a groove on the upper side. The flowers are borne singly or in pairs in leaf axils on hairy stalks long. There are 5 very hairy, blackish- purple, linear to lance-shaped, tapering sepals which are long. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is pale lilac to deep lilac-coloured on the outside and white with lilac or purple spots on the inside. The outer surface of the tube and petal lobes is hairy, the inner surface of the lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is filled with woolly hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from April to October and the fruits which follow are oval- shaped with a glabrous, straw-coloured, papery covering and are long.Newman E. margarethae flower detail Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Spencer Le Marchant Moore in 1899 and the description was published in Journal of the Linnean Society, Botany. The specific epithet (margarethae) honours Margaret Forrest, wife of Sir John Forrest. Distribution and habitat Sandbank poverty bush is widespread and common between Leonora and Newman in the Gascoyne, Little Sandy Desert, Murchison and Pilbara biogeographic regions where it grows in mulga woodland on hardpan flats or sometimes on stony hills. Ecology Sandbank poverty bush is an indicator species that pasture is in poor condition due to overgrazing, especially of grasses such as broad-leaf wanderrie grass (Monachather paradoxus) and buck wanderrie grass (Eriachne helmsii). This poverty bush is not palatable to stock. This species is susceptible to predation by the hopbush scale insect (Pulvinaria dodonaeae, Order Hemiptera, Family Coccidae). About 10% of plants are killed although other species of eremophlias are not affected. Conservation status Eremophila margarethae is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife Use in horticulture The silvery-grey foliage of this eremophila complements the blue flowers of this hardy, small shrub. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock. It prefers a well-drained soil in a sunny location but will develop a more open habit in partial shade. It is very drought tolerant and moderately resistant to frost.
