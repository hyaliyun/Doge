Roosevelt, a hypothetical Roosevelt dictatorship was proposed by some supporters of Franklin Roosevelt. If it had happened, the President of the United States might have assumed extraordinary powers either by an explicit grant of Congress or through a self-coup, perhaps modeling itself on Italy under Mussolini, which was popular and respected at that time. Rhetorical support for such a \\"benevolent autocracy\\" reached a zenith from November 1932 to March 1933 during the final months of President Herbert Hoover, when the country was at its most desperate and ready to pin its hopes upon the President-Elect. The loose movement passed shortly after Roosevelt's inauguration, however, with calls for dictatorship largely coming to an end by the spring of 1933. Roosevelt would come to exercise broad executive authority throughout his 12 years in office, but he ultimately governed within the limits of his constitutional remit. Background The 1932 United States presidential election saw Franklin Roosevelt win election as President of the United States in a lopsided and crushing victory over incumbent Republican president Herbert Hoover. Roosevelt's victory came at the height of the Great Depression and was buoyed by his use of populist appeals. Roosevelt's ascendancy occurred during an era in which the creation of totalitarian states in Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Poland, and other countries led to its characterization as an age of plebiscitary dictatorship. At the time, the fascist government in Italy had gained some respect from American commentators and the concept of dictatorship itself was relatively popular; \\"dictator\\" lacked many negative connotations it would later acquire. Public support During the four months between his November 1932 election and his March 1933 inauguration, several influential voices in American political commentary called for Roosevelt to assume extraordinary powers upon taking office. In his nationally syndicated newspaper column, Walter Lippmann wrote that \\"a mild species of dictatorship will help us over the roughest spots in the road ahead\\" while the New York Herald Tribune opined similar sentiment in an editorial titled \\"For Dictatorship, If Necessary\\". The magazine Commonweal, meanwhile, put forth the contention that Roosevelt should assume \\"the powers of a virtual dictatorship to reorganize the government\\". Roger Babson called for limitations to be imposed on the powers of Congress, including the abolition of the United States Senate, while Will Rogers supported proposals to extend extraordinary powers to Roosevelt by writing that \\"Mussolini could take our country today and put people back to work at the rate of one million per month\\". Roosevelt received letters from around the nation imploring him to assume extraordinary powers. The month prior to his March 1933 inauguration, Speaker John Nance Garner introduced legislation into the U.S. House of Representatives that would allow the presidency the unilateral authority to suspend congressional appropriations, abolish government departments, dismiss civil servants at his discretion, and reduce statutory appropriations and contractual payments, with Congress only able to check such measures with a two-thirds supermajority in both houses. Bertrand Snell ‚Äì leader of the Republican Party in the House ‚Äì criticized the bill which, he said, would \\"make an absolute dictator of Roosevelt. It would give him more power than any executive leader in the world except Mussolini\\". The legislation seemingly did not proceed nor come close to passing the House, with a \\"wild rebellion\\" sweeping the floor and \\"unalterable\\" Republican opposition. Roosevelt's stance During his March 1933 inauguration address, Roosevelt enjoyed immense crowd approval when he stated that he was considering seeking sweeping authority equal to what a president might be granted during an invasion: Eleanor Roosevelt would later write that she found the moment \\"a little terrifying\\" due to the enthusiasm with which the crowd greeted the suggestion. During this period, according to Benjamin Alpers, the \\"press almost universally noted the new president's calls for greater power and just as universally had nothing detrimental to say about them\\". That month Roosevelt was scheduled to address the American Legion, in what would be his first public speech since the inauguration. In the first draft of his speech, he planned to declare his authority to arm and discipline the legion into an auxiliary military force to, in the words of historian Jonathan Alter, \\"guard banks or put down rebellions\\" as the president's \\"private army\\". One line, removed from that draft of the speech, read \\"As new commander-in-chief under the oath to which you are still bound I reserve to myself the right to command you in any phase of the situation which now confronts us.\\" The speech that Roosevelt actually gave did not mention a private army nor suggest he could or would \\"command\\" the veterans; Roosevelt instead argued only for the \\"sacrifice and devotion\\" of wartime. Aftermath Ultimately, Roosevelt did not assume totalitarian authority, and though he would exercise increasingly broad executive powers throughout his administration, he limited himself to constitutionally imposed limits. In rhetoric, Roosevelt used the language of \\"democratic populism\\", framing his administration's policies as squarely part of the classic traditions of democratic American government, and \\"avoided rhetorically assuming the mantle of dictator.\\" By the spring of 1933, only fringe elements continued to make calls for dictatorship or semi-dictatorship. In October 1933, Roosevelt ‚Äì addressing students of Washington College ‚Äì opined that a dictatorship was unnecessary and more could be accomplished through cooperation than through coercion. Roosevelt's political opponents would keep alive the idea that he had ambitions to become a dictator, however. Throughout the mid to late 1930s, Americans from all political parties would regularly accuse their opponents of either desiring dictatorship, or being dupes and lackeys of foreign dictators. Dictatorship in general also lost some of its luster as Mussolini's Italy lost prestige. A 1936 poll by the American Institute of Public Opinion saw 45% of the public answering \\"yes\\" to the question \\"Do you believe acts and policies of the Roosevelt administration may lead to dictatorship?\\" with affirmative answers highest among Republicans (83%), independent voters (53%), and socialists (30%), and lowest among Democrats (9%). Residents of Republican- leaning Vermont and Maine led states in answering yes (69% and 66%, respectively), while those of solidly Democratic Mississippi and Alabama were most skeptical (22% and 20%, respectively) that Roosevelt was leading the country towards dictatorship. The Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, frequently called Roosevelt's \\"court-packing plan\\", reignited charges of Roosevelt's dictatorial ambitions. In 1983, historian Michael Parrish argued that the court-packing plan \\"gave fresh ammunition to those who accused him of dictatorship, tyranny, and fascism\\". Wendell Wilkie criticized the 1940 Destroyers for Bases agreement, the predecessor to the Lend-Lease program which aided the British in World War II, as the \\"most arbitrarial and dictatorial action ever taken in the history of the United States\\". Though he agreed with the proposal, Wilkie believed it should have been authorized by Congress. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote that Roosevelt was a war-crime committing dictator over the agreement. Writing in 2011, James Lindsay opined that the Destroyers for Bases agreement was so controversial \\"precisely because the United States was moving away from pure neutrality\\".

The congregation was founded in 1896 by immigrants from the city of Nizhyn in the Ukraine who met in members‚Äô homes. The congregation purchased the building at 771 S 2nd Street in 1905 and held services and community events there until 1984 when it closed and merged with Temple Beth Zion-Beth Israel. Third Baptist Church Neziner's building at 771 S 2nd Street was erected in 1811 as a meetinghouse for the Third Baptist Church. The neighborhood was then part of the Southwark district. The church served as a hospital during the Civil War for Union soldiers returning north. Many died and were buried in the burial ground behind the building. Neziner Synagogue, 1905-1984 Immigrants from Nezhin, Ukraine organized the congregation in 1889. Congregation members purchased the former church building at 771 S 2nd Street in 1905. While never officially affiliating with a Jewish denomination or movement, the congregation generally identified as Conservative by the 1930s. The congregation was active and had young people's services, drama groups, girls and boys scouts. Its sisterhood was founded in 1930. Rabbi Alexander Levin led the shul in 1947. Samuel Shore served as Cantor in the 1950s and 1960s for 22 years. Cantor Shore was succeeded by Cantor Abraham Dubow until his passing in December 1972. Neziner shared an annual brotherhood service with Gloria Dei (Old Swedes') Church. They held one in 1947 and again in 1949. Neziner joined Goria Dei Old Swedes in February 1954 to welcome Governor John S. Fine opening Brotherhood Week. In February 1956, members of Old Swedes attended Neziner for Purim eve services and celebrations, and Neziner attended Old Swedes in support of Brother Week. The congregation hired Rabbi Saul Wisemon in August 1982 to serve on a part-time basis.https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22799764/rabbi_phillly/ Wisemon fled Philadelphia in April 1983 when police searched his apartment for a Torah scroll missing from the synagogue. Neziner Legacy, 1984-present The Neziner Congregation closed its doors in 1984 and merged into Temple Beth Zion-Beth Israel, a Conservative synagogue in the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood. Beth Zion-Beth Israel named its youth education program the Neziner Hebrew School. The former synagogue's building was sold and converted to residential apartments in 1987.

Prior to its name change, it was a part of the Laurenval and then later Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board. It was located at 3200 Blvd du Souvenir in Laval. Its current incarnation is Laval Senior Academy. History The school was initially founded by the newly created Protestant School board of Greater St Martin in 1962 and was named Chomedey Protestant High school. In 1964 during the time of the creation of the city of Laval and the establishment of regional school boards in Quebec, the school was renamed Chomedey Polyvalent High school and merged in students from the other local high school, in the then St.Martin Parish as well as students from the newly formed Laurenvale school board in the Two Mountains areahttps://souvenir.schoolqc.ca/?P=aboutusA Meeting of the People: School Boards and Protestant Communities in Quebec, 1801-1998 In February in 1981 an explosion occurred in a washroom at the school, smoke filled the adjacent hallways. Students were quickly evacuated from the building and classes were cancelled for the remainder of the day. Investigators concluded that the explosion was caused by a homemade bomb and attributed motivation as a student prank. The damage was considered minimal.Article \\"School Bomb Work of Pranksters\\" The Montreal Gazette February 18, 1981 At the start of the 1983 school year, the senior classes of Western Laval High School (WLHS) and Chomedey Polyvalent High School (At the time part of the Laurenval Schoolboard) were amalgamated into Chomedey Polyvalent High School, thus creating WHLS as a Junior High School and CPHS as its senior counterpart. At the end of the decade, due to the influx of non-Catholic students who didn't qualify for English education in Quebec, the Junior/Senior split of the schools was reversed and WLHS became an English high school and CPHS a French instruction secondary school, then known as \\"√âcole secondaire Chomedey\\"Memorandum to WLHS Students April 7, 1998 \\"Principal's Message\\" by Leslie R.

The study of fatal dog attacks can lead to prevention techniques which can help to reduce all dog bite injuries, not only fatalities. Dog bites and attacks can result in pain, bruising, wounds, bleeding, soft tissue injury, broken bones, loss of limbs, scalping, disfigurement, life-threatening injuries, and death. Causes of death in dog bite related fatalities There are several ways a person can die from a dog bite or a dog attack, including: * Air embolism * Blunt force trauma, usually to the head, is more common with infants or small children * Broken neck * Decapitation, the removal of the head or brain from the rest of the spine * Heart attack brought on by exertion during a dog attack, from loss of blood pressure due to bleeding, from the stress of an attack, or resultant injuries * Hemorrhage/exsanguination, loss of blood through severing an artery or vein, or from bleeding out from multiple wounds, or bleeding for an excessive time before victim is found * Sepsis from bite wounds  Published studies  Scientists, scholars, medical personnel, veterinarians, and lawmakers have been documenting the societal problem of fatal dog attacks for several decades in an effort to identify causes and come up with solutions. = 2013 study: Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association = The most recent study of the epidemiology of fatal dog bites in the United States was published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) in 2013. While earlier studies were based on television and newspaper reports, this was the first study to be based on law-enforcement reports, animal control reports, and investigator statements. It identified preventable factors in the fatal incidents. They found that the most common contributing factors were: absence of an able-bodied person to intervene, no familiar relationship of victims with dogs, owner failure to neuter dogs, compromised ability of victims to interact appropriately with dogs (e.g. mental disabilities), dogs kept isolated from regular positive human interactions versus family dogs (e.g. dogs kept chained in backyards), owners' prior mismanagement of dogs, and owners' history of abuse or neglect of dogs. Furthermore, they found that in 80% of the incidents, 4 or more of the above factors co-occurred. The authors found that in a significant number of DBRFs there was either a conflict between different media sources reporting breed and/or a conflict between media and animal control reports relative to the reporting of breed. For 401 dogs described in various media accounts of DBRFs, media sources reported conflicting breed attributions for 124 of the dogs (30.9%); and where there were media reports and an animal control report (346 dogs), there were conflicting breed attributions for 139 dogs (40.2%) According to this study, reliable verification of the breed of dog was only possible in 18% of incidents. = 2009 study: Wilderness & Environmental Medicine = This 27-year study collected data from the CDC Wide-Ranging OnLine Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER) program. It looked at cases in which the cause of death according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes was dog bites. It did not include fatalities secondary to an infection from a bite. During those 27 years, 504 deaths due to dog bites were reported (an average of 18.67 per year) to have occurred in every state except North Dakota. Six states (Texas, California, Florida, Illinois, Georgia and North Carolina) accounted for 37% of the reported cases (but they also compose 36% of the US population). The number of deaths per capita were highest in Alaska (11.83 deaths per 10 million inhabitants); the rest of the states ranged from 0 to 2.56 deaths per 10 million population. Most fatal dog bites occur in young children and the elderly. Elderly victims have a higher in-hospital fatality rate after the trauma compared to younger victims. The study indicated that, in the US, incidents of dog-related injury and death increased along with the increases in dog and human populations. Males and children comprised the majority of fatal dog attacks, with children under age 10 representing 70% of deaths from dog bites from 1979 to 1988. Males comprised 58.1% of the reported cases whereas females comprised 41.9%, compared to the US population with 48.87% males and 51.13% females. With respect to race percentages of victims, 81.3% were white (M: 46.8%, F: 34,5%), 14.3% were black (M: 8.5%, F: 5.7%) and 4.4% were listed as \\"other\\". When compared to the US population, there was no significant difference in frequency of dog-related deaths in relation to race; the study indicated the percentages of dog ownership to be 92% white, 3% black and 3% other races; however, it is important to note that most of the available data did not report the race of the victim. At the time of the study, some of the limitations included the lack of information regarding many important factors about the reported attacks, such as the activity that was taking place at the time, whether or not it was provoked, a positive identification of the dog's breed, size and whether it was neutered or spayed, the health of the dog and victim, location of the wounds and other relative information. There is also the possibility that a few of the reported dog bite deaths had been miscoded or possibly omitted in cases where the cause of death was secondary to the bite. A mandatory national registration system on all animal attacks with detailed information was advised in an effort to provide more insight into the factors leading up to the attack. = 2000 study by CDC, HSUS & AVMA = A joint project between researchers in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) and American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), this study published in 2000 evaluated 20 years (1979-1998) of fatalities by using 18-years of data collected previously for similar studies, newly identified data from media reports for 1997-1998, and a database from HSUS. The purpose was to summarize breeds associated with reported human DBRF during a 20-year period and assess policy implications. The authors postulated that the resulting tabulations by breed may be biased due to four factors: that their method of searching for DBRFs by using NEXIS to locate media reports was likely to only discover about 74% of the actual incidents; that dog attacks involving certain breeds may be more likely to have received media coverage in the first place; that identifications of the dog's breed is often subjective (causing possible misreporting of breed); and that the researchers weren't sure how to account for crossbreed dogs (more than one breed in a single dog). The study defined dog attacks as \\"a human death caused by trauma from a dog bite\\". Excluded from the study were deaths by disease caused by dog bites, strangulation on a scarf or leash pulled by a dog, heart attacks or traffic accident, and falling injury or fire ant bites from being pushed down by a dog. The study also excluded four deaths by trauma from dog bites by police dogs or guard dogs employed by the government. After excluding approximately 90 deaths from the study because no breed information was available, the researchers ended up with 238 deaths for their 20-year analysis representing 25 breeds of dog, or 227 deaths for which they had additional data for analysis. Using the 227 collection: 133 (58%) were unrestrained dogs and on the owners' property; 55 (24%) were loose off the owners' property; 38 (17%) were restrained dogs on their owners' property; and only one (less than 1%) was restrained off the owners' property. The authors expressed disappointment that they could not adequately evaluate a \\"risk rate\\" for each dog breed (number of fatalities divided by the number of dogs), citing unavailability of population figures for each breed. Instead, they simply tabulated the fatalities by breed. Despite that limitation, the data indicated that Rottweilers and pit bull-type dogs accounted for 67% of human DBRF in the United States between 1997 and 1998, and followed with \\"It is extremely unlikely that they accounted for anywhere near 60% of dogs in the United States during that same period and, thus, there appears to be a breed-specific problem with fatalities.\\" In the 20 years from 1979 to 1998, the breeds of dogs involved were as follows: Death- based approach (each breed counted only once per fatal incident): Pit bull- type 76; Rottweiler 44; German Shepherd 27; Husky-type 21; Malamute 15; Wolf- dog 14; Mixed-breed 12; Chow 11; Doberman 10; St. Bernard 8; Great Dane 7; Labrador 5; Akita 4; 3 each of Sled dog, Bulldog, Mastiff, Boxer, Collie; 2 each of Bullmastiff, Hound-type; 1 each of Retriever-type, Chesapeake Bay Retriever, West Highland Terrier, Terrier-type, Japanese Hunting Dog, Newfoundland, Coonhound, Sheepdog, Australian Shepherd, Rhodesian Ridgeback, Cocker Spaniel. Dog-based approach (each dog counted, even in multi-dog fatal incidents): Pit bull-type 118; Rottweiler 67; Mixed-breed 47; German Shepherd 41; Chow 21; Husky-type 21; Malamute 16; Wolf-dog 15; Doberman 13; Great Dane 13; Sled-dog 12; Labrador 8; St. Bernard 8; Collie 6; Boxer 5; Mastiff 5; Akita 4; Bulldog 3; Australian Shepherd 3; Bullmastiff 2; Hound-type 2; and 1 each of Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Cocker Spaniel, Coonhound, Japanese Hunting Dog, Newfoundland, Retriever-type, Rhodesian Ridgeback, Sheepdog, Terrier- type, West Highland Terrier. The authors attempted to evaluate efficacy of breed-specific legislation (BSL) as well as generic non-breed-specific dangerous dog laws, listed some of the difficulties of enforcement and touched on several of the factors, but did not have any recommendations ‚Äî citing that they were unaware of any formal evaluation of effectiveness of BSL or general non-BSL dangerous dog laws in preventing fatal or nonfatal dog bites. Some other recommendations by the authors included: * Regulate individual dogs and owners on the basis of their behavior * Enact stringent animal control laws and increase enforcement * Enact dangerous dog laws that place primary responsibility for a dog‚Äôs behavior on the owner * Target chronically irresponsible dog owners * Encourage dog owners to seek professional help in training and socializing their pets * Enforce leash laws * Enforce laws against dog fighting * Evaluate the effects of regulations that limit fences to heights insufficient for controlling large dogs * Educate owners with respect to selection of breed, decisions to neuter/spay their dogs, and importance of socializing dogs * Add education in schools and adult-education programs about bite prevention and canine care * Improve surveillance and reporting for fatal and nonfatal dog bites, including collecting details of event, circumstances and the dogs and parties involved * Collect data on the entire dog population for comparison/percentage purposes * Maintain adequate funding for animal control agencies = 1997 study by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and HSUS = Collecting data from HSUS, Nexis and death certificates, this 1997 write-up analysed 279 USA dog-bite related deaths from 1979-1994, briefly mentioned three specific cases from 1995-1996, and tabulated breed-specific data from 1979-1996. Of the 199 incidents in which breed was known, the report tabulates the breeds by most fatalities first, presenting: Pit bull 60, Rottweiler 29, German shepherd 19, Husky 14, Malamute 12, Doberman 8, Chow 8, Great Dane 6, St. Bernard 4, Akita 4. For crossbreeds, they present: Wolf hybrid 14, German shepherd 11, Pit bull 10, Husky 6, Malamute 3, Rottweiler 3, Chow 3. The report suggested improvements in three categories for preventing dog bites: owner and public education, better enforcement by animal control, and better bite reporting for future analyses. = 1982 study by University of Texas and Children's Medical Center, Dallas = A study conducted at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School identified 74 fatal dog bites during the period 1966‚Äì1980 from news media and medical literature. Summary of some of the findings: * The dogs were owned by the victim's family in 38 cases and a neighbor in 25 cases. * The dogs were mostly described as pets or family dogs, and in 29 cases prior behavior was specifically stated as friendly or without viciousness. Only three of the dogs were considered guard dogs and two known to have prior bite histories. * In 64 out of the 74 cases the location of attack was within or adjacent to a home or yard. * Of the 23 victims less than one year in age, 22 occurred inside a home, and in 16 cases both child and dog lived there. * In most cases the dog was not provoked, and in many instances the dog knew the victim. * Dogs were either killed on scene or quarantined for rabies (all negative), and \\"once subdued, no further viciousness by the dogs was reported in any case.\\" * Only 16 breeds of dog were represented in the 74 cases: German Shepherd 16, Mixed breed 10, Husky 9, St. Bernard 8, Bullterrier (pit bull) 6, Great Dane 6, Malamute 5, Unknown breed 5, Golden retriever 3, Boxer 2, Dachshund 2, Doberman pinscher 2, Collie 2, Rottweiler 1, Basenji 1, Chow chow 1, Labrador retriever 1, Yorkshire terrier 1. * When comparing number of deaths by each particular breed to the number of registrations of that breed, the authors wrote: \\"German shepherds were involved in more deaths (16) than any other breed, but German shepherds have the highest registration (74,723) of any large breed according to the American Kennel Club. The greater number of deaths may simply reflect a larger population. In relation to its small registration (929) the bullterrier (pit bull) was responsible for the highest number of deaths (6), but the popularity of this breed may be increasing and, therefore, its population might not be reflected by its registration.\\" = 1977 study by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention = The first epidemiological study of dog-bite fatalities in the United States was conducted by an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1977. The study covers eleven fatality cases. Based on circumstances in each case, the author theorizes that most of the fatalities were territorial issues (in the dog's mind). He also concludes that most fatal attacks by dogs were initiated with intent to kill. He concludes this by comparing the 75% of these cases of attack by a single dog (which attacked the head and neck) to the statistic that 75% of nonfatal attack wounds are being inflicted on extremities (which are not usually fatal). The author also rues the lack of \\"comprehensive surveillance\\" of dog bite related fatalities, and counsels that fatalities should be examined to determine the magnitude of the problem and to identify causative factors which can be eliminated to reduce fatalities.

Despite concerns from human rights activists over his possible Russian citizenship, his drunken state during the murders, and his petition for clemency, Lykov was sentenced to death by the Minsk Regional Court, and subsequently executed in 2014. Early life Little is known about Lykov's early life. He was a Muscovite, was married and had two children (a son living in Russia and a daughter living in Germany), with whom he didn't keep in contact. Lykov and his mother moved to the city of Baranavichy at an unknown period of time, dropping their Russian citizenship in favor of Belarusian ones. While living in the country, he was at various times convicted of theft, robbery, embezzlement, hooliganism and not paying his alimony. While serving time in prison, Lykov met 38-year- old Viktor Gladky, whom would later become his first victim. Murders =Viktor Gladky and his mother= In October 2002, Lykov visited Gladky's house in the village of Kirsha, Minsk Region, with the latter's mother present there as well. According to Lykov, he and Viktor were talking normally when Gladky mention how good his life was. Soon after, a quarrel started between the two, with Eduard beating Viktor with his hands, feet, wooden logs and other objects. Gladky's mother started screaming, grabbing a knife and threatening to kill Lykov if he persisted. However, Lykov managed to get the knife away from her hands and stabbed the woman multiple times. After she died, he put her bloodied body on the sofa. While Eduard was cleaning up the crime scene, he overheard the barely-living Viktor trying to say something to him. In order to prevent being identified, Lykov grabbed an axe and hit Gladky on the head, killing him instantly. Lykov evaded suspicion, as Viktor's drunken brother, Mikhail, believing he had committed the double murder, falsely confessed to the crime. He was sentenced to serve 8 years in prison, and was released in 2010, a year before the actual perpetrator was captured. =His girlfriend's former roommate= On June 10, 2004, while in Grodno apartment of his girlfriend's former roommate, only identified as F., Lykov began arguing with the man. Shortly after, he stabbed F. at least 11 times in the back with a knife before hitting him on the head at least 3 times with an axe. The corpse was then dismembered, and the pieces buried in a nearby forest. =Kashperova= In that same apartment, in which the homeless Lykov lived only from time to time, on March 19, 2011, he killed his ex-girlfriend, Kashperova. Lykov hit her at least 2 times on the head with metal dumbbells, at least 2 times to the back of the neck, in the back and, in the end, tied a piece of cloth around her neck. Kashperova's body was then transported put in the bathroom, and hid under a pile of clothes. Following the murder, Lykov lived in the apartment for about a week. =Grigorenko= Lykov eventually settled in the village of Zhdanovichy, in the Minsk Region, where he met a 74-year-old pensioner named Grigorenko. On September 18, 2011, the two men were in Grigorenko's yard shed, when they began quarreling. Noticing a metal pipe on the windowsill, Lykov grabbed it and hit Grigorenko six times with it, killing him. After reassuring himself that he was dead, Lykov stole 150 rubles that were in the victim's pocket. Trial, sentence and death After being monitored for some time, Eduard Lykov was eventually captured by the authorities. During the interrogation, he voluntarily confessed to all of his crimes (despite alleging that the policemen \\"helped\\" him by giving him alcohol), trying to explain that it was only arguing gone wrong. After changing three lawyers, Lykov, presenting himself as a \\"non-christian\\" at the trial, pleaded for life imprisonment. However, the Minsk Regional Court was not lenient with him, and sentenced him to death. The sentence stirred up controversy, as human rights organizations aiming to abolish the death penalty in the country argued that Lykov shouldn't be executed because of his Russian citizenship. The Russian embassy in Minsk checked the claims, but no such citizenship was found. As for the convict himself, he wrote a petition for clemency to President Alexander Lukashenko, which was subsequently denied. In 2014, Eduard Lykov was executed in Minsk.

It is the highest point in the Cathedral Range, which is a subrange of the Okanogan Range in the North Cascades. The mountain is situated south of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, on the eastern side of the Cascade crest, in the Pasayten Wilderness, on land managed by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Mount Lago, to the west-southwest, and Amphitheater Mountain lies to the north. Remmel is the third-highest summit of the Okanogan Range following Mount Lago (8,745 ft), and Robinson Mountain (8,726 ft). These three peaks follow Jack Mountain {9,075 ft} as the highest peaks in the Pasayten Wilderness. Remmel is the most prominent mountain in the Pasayten Wilderness. Precipitation runoff from Remmel Mountain drains into the Chewuch River basin. History The peak was named in 1898 by Albert Hale Sylvester, a pioneer surveyor, explorer, topographer, and forest supervisor in the Cascades who named thousands of natural features. The first ascent of the summit was made July 26, 1904, by Sledge Tatum and George E. Louden, Jr., two members of the Boundary Survey group led by Edward C. Barnard. Remmel Mountain was once topped by a gable roof single-room 14' by 14' fire lookout that was built by the Forest Service in the 1930s. The lookout was subject to heavy lightning strikes that forced its closure, and by 1969 was reported destroyed.National Geodetic Survey Data Sheet Remmel Had it been still operating in 2001, that fire lookout would have been in a position to locate the nearby Thirtymile Fire which killed four firefighters in Chewuch Canyon. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, granite spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Remmel in the distance with glacier-scoured landscape in the foreground The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Climate Remmel from Horseshoe Basin Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences higher precipitation than the east side, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W.

It elected representatives to the Cardiff County Borough Council and, from 1974, South Glamorgan County Council. The ward ceased to exist in 1996. Description and background In July 1890, following the creation of Cardiff County Borough Council, Central was a new electoral ward created, one of the ten in the county borough. The ward was bordered to the west by the River Taff, to the east by the Taff Vale Railway and to the south by the Great Western Railway line. The Riverside ward lay on the other side of the River Taff, the Cathays ward to the northeast (of the Taff Vale Railway) and the South ward lay to the south. Before the electoral reforms of the 20th century, councillors were elected by burgesses i.e. ratepayers in the ward. The electorate of the Central ward in 1985 was 4217, increasing to 4908 in 1993. The Cathays ward was expanded to incorporate the area of the Central ward in 1996. South Glamorgan County Council 1973-1996 In 1973 elections were held for the new South Glamorgan County Council. The Central ward continued as a ward to this authority, electing two county councillors in 1973, 1977 and 1981, then one county councillor from 1985. The party representing Central changed at every election, from Labour in 1973, to Conservative in 1977, back to Labour in 1981, Liberal in 1985, back to Labour in 1983, then finally Liberal Democrat in 1993. =1993= Central's Liberal Democrat Cllr Rowland stood in the Cathays ward in the 1995 City and County of Cardiff election, but was not successful.

Initially (with annual Cardiff elections prior to World War II) on a three-yearly cycle. =1970= At the local elections on 7 May 1970 (the final elections to the county borough council), Labour recovered some ground on the Conservative Party, winning back seats in the city. The Conservative Lady Mayoress, Mary Hallinan, had represented the Central ward for the previous nine years and was the most prominent casualty in the election, losing her seat to Labour's Bill Herbert. Herbert was chairman of the Cardiff United Residents' Association and a leading campaigner against the proposed new hook road. =1890-2= In November 1890, following the redistribution of councillors across the ten Cardiff wards, Central (like the South ward having many businesses and non-resident ratepayer voters) lost the long-standing Liberal councillor to the Conservatives. The result was declared from the rear of the Town Hall and the margin was only two votes. Mr Proger, a master plumber by trade, had been a member of the council for the previous 12 years. In 1891 the Conservative candidate also won against the sitting Liberal councillor. * = retiring ward councillor for re-election Succession The Central ward was replaced from 1974 on the new Cardiff City Council by an expanded Cathays ward. The boundary of Cathays ward expanded to include the city centre (and Castle community). Several of the Central ward councillors on South Glamorgan County Council also represented the Cathays ward concurrently.

Consisting of 3 faculties and a series of research centers and institutes, UCLouvain Charleroi consists of the Maison Georges Lema√Ætre, in the center of the city, and a branch in Montignies-sur-Sambre. It is one of the three UCLouvain sites in the Hainaut Province, along with UCLouvain FUCaM Mons and UCLouvain Tournai.  History  During the Leuven crisis in the 1960s, a transfer of the French-speaking part of the Catholic University of Louvain from Leuven to Charleroi, one of Belgium's largest cities though without any university, is considered as one of the major alternatives to a relocation in Ottignies, which will later hold Louvain-la-Neuve. The Maison Georges Lema√Ætre in the city center. When the university is legally split in 1970, the Maison Georges Lema√Ætre became property of the French-speaking University of Louvain. It is a large neo-Gothic mansion, designed by architect Auguste Cador. It is located on boulevard Devreux, a few dozen meters from the birthplace of Georges Lema√Ætre, which was located rue du Pont Neuf 10. Georges Lema√Ætre, the founder of the Big Bang Theory, was an alumnus of the Catholic University of Louvain. Until 1995, courses of the University of Louvain Faculty of Economics, Social and Political Sciences and Communication in Charleroi were organised in the buildings of the Institut Saint-Andr√©, a secondary school located next to the Maison Georges Lema√Ætre. A violent fire on 7 March 1995 ravaged the secondary school, which was rebuilt in 1997. UCLouvain thus completely renovated the Maison Georges Lema√Ætre in 1995, and now concentrates most of its Caroloregian activity of teaching and research there. In parallel and since 1975, the Catholic University Faculties of Mons (FUCaM), which were an independent university until 2011, have been offering programmes in economics and management sciences on the Sainte-Th√©r√®se site of the Institut d'Enseignement secondaire compl√©mentaire catholique (IESCA), in Montignies-sur-Sambre. Since 2005, following the founding of the Acad√©mie Louvain, these courses were integrated into the Louvain School of Management. In 2009, the Charleroi-Europe Catholic College (of which IESCA is a member) co-founded the Haute √âcole Louvain en Hainaut, a partner college of UCLouvain. This merger was shortly followed by the merger of the FUCaM with the University of Louvain in 2011. These two institutions currently share the Montignies campus. Since 2018, a third faculty has established itself in Charleroi: the Louvain School of Engineering. From 2020, it will offer a bachelor's degree in computer science.  Description  UCLouvain offers master's degrees and university diplomas in management and fiscal sciences on the Montignies site. Certificates in accounting and tax expertise exempt students from the entrance exams to the Belgian Institute of Company Auditors and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. The Maison Georges Lema√Ætre houses various research centres as well as the Open Faculty of Economic and Social Policy (FOPES), which is a department of the Faculty of Economic, Social, Political and Communication Sciences of UCLouvain (ESPO) and organises a master's degree in economic and social policy. It also serves as an exhibition centre and research centre for CIRTES, the Interdisciplinary Centre for Research on Work, the State and Society. UCLouvain has also set up research centres at the Gosselies aeropole: the Centre of Excellence in Information Technology (CETIC) serving as a centre of expertise for the development of Walloon companies and founded by UCLouvain with the universities of Namur and Mons, as well as the Cenaero (Research Centre in Aeronautics) with the University of Li√®ge and the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles, an institute for the development of aeronautics and space industry. In addition, the Gosselies cluster hosts three spin-offs from UCLouvain: Cedit, a technology company, and since 2011, iTeos, a farmaceutical company founded within the de Duve Institute at UCLouvain Brussels Woluwe and which raised a capital of 75 million US dollars in 2018, and Viridaxis, since 2011. UCLouvain also participates in the Interuniversity Certificate in Energy Electronics organised by Thales Alenia Space at the Open University of the Wallonia- Brussels Federation, which is based in Charleroi. = Programmes = Open Faculty of Economic and Social Policy * Master in economic and social policy  Louvain School of Management  * Master in Management Sciences * Master in Management Sciences (60 ECTS) * Master in Management sciences, specialising in taxation and expertise * University diploma in personal taxation * University diploma in corporate taxation * University diploma in public accounting * University diploma in advanced public accounting * Inter- university diploma in digital transformation of businesses  Louvain School of Engineering  * Bachelor in Computer Science  Faculty of Theology  * University diploma in didactics of religious education Faculty of Economic, Social and Political Sciences and Communication *University diploma in transmedia (joint degree with the Institut des Arts de Diffusion and the University of Mons). = Research institutes = * CIRTES (Interdisciplinary Research Centre \\"Work, State and Society\\") * Cenaero (Aeronautical Research Centre) * CETIC (Centre of Excellence in Information Technology)  References  Category:1966 establishments in Belgium Category:Educational institutions established in 1966 Category:Catholic University of Leuven Category:Universit√© catholique de Louvain Category:Universities in Belgium Category:Catholic universities and colleges in Belgium Category:Charleroi ","title":"UCLouvain Charleroi"},{"id":"61111665","text":"Chiitan is a Japanese mascot which was formerly a self-declared unofficial representative of the small port city of Susaki. It is a self-described \\"0-year-old fairy baby\\" otter with no gender that wears a turtle as a hat. The mascot was created in 2017 and participated in videos and events with government officials and Susaki's official city mascot, Shinjo-kun. Chiitan gained popularity through its unusual YouTube videos and social media posts in which it performed various clumsy or violent stunts. It became one of the most popular mascots in Japan in 2018, and at its height had nearly a million followers on Twitter. In January 2019 complaints about the controversial nature of Chiitan's videos and social media posts led Susaki officials to reject its association with the mascot. In addition to excluding the mascot from official events, the government of Susaki claimed that it held the copyright for Chiitan's likeness and threatened to sue the company responsible for managing Chiitan if it continued to produce media content with the character. In April 2019 the mascot was featured on an episode of HBO's Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. The episode praised Chiitan's antics but led its host, John Oliver, to create a replacement mascot-friend for Shinjo-kun. Following the episode, Chiitan challenged Oliver to a fight on Twitter for stealing its friend, shortly after which its Twitter accounts were suspended without warning. Several other media companies cancelled projects they had to collaborate with Chiitan in 2019, but it remains popular on other social media platforms. History =Creation= An Asian small-clawed otter 220px In 2013, the city of Susaki, Kochi Prefecture unveiled an official mascot called , an extinct Japanese river otter wearing a nabeyaki (hot pot) ramen dish for a hat.Hyper Japan Festival The Shinjo river in Susaki is noted as the place of the last official sighting of the species in 1979. After its creation, Shinjo- kun competed and won Japan's annual competition for local mascots, the Yuru- chara Grand Prix, beating out 1,400 other mascot entrants. In 2016, Susaki named a local Asian small-clawed otterYamamitsu and Krishna named \\"Chiitan\\" as its honorary tourism ambassador. The otter had gained popularity and had its own public access TV show.Blaster It was known for its curiosity and its \\"adorable squeaks that could melt even the coldest hearts\\".Piedra In December 2017 a group of people from Chiitan the otter's Tokyo-based production company created a mascot for the otter, also named \\"Chiitan\\", in order to improve the otter's popularity. Chiitan's design was created by illustrator , the same designer of Shinjo-kun. The character has no gender, and wears the turtle \\"Kame-chan\\" as a hat.Sherman On its Twitter page Chiitan described itself as a \\"0-year-old fairy baby\\". Because of its association with both Chiitan the otter and Shinjo-kun, which were both formally associated with Susaki, Chiitan declared that it itself was also an unofficial \\"tourist ambassador\\" for the city. =Popularity= Chiitan began to produce media that was shared on YouTube and social media, and gained sufficient popularity that government officials in Susaki eventually accepted it as an unofficial city mascot. Officials from the city appeared with Chiitan in events and videos, and allowed Chiitan to appear and interact with its official mascot, Shinjo-kun, in events and videos as well.Pearson By July 2018 Chiitan's Japanese language Twitter account had 750,000 followers, and its English-language account had 535,000 followers. Chiitan's popularity continued to grow throughout the year, and by January 2019 it had 906,000 Twitter followers.Debczak Much of the media produced by Chiitan was often chaotic and involved the mascot acting clumsy or violent. Occasionally its videos were criticized for being \\"creepy\\", \\"reckless\\", and \\"dangerous\\". Some of Chiitan's videos included it hitting a punching bag with a baseball bat, jumping into metal boxes, flipping a car, twirling a motorized weed cutter around its head,Denyer falling off a pogo stick, failing at bowling, and falling off a bike while trying to fire a bow and arrow.St. Michael, May 5, 2018 In one video, captioned \\"Chiitan is going to visit your house\\", the mascot takes a baseball bat from a locker, stuffs it into its costume, and walks offscreen. Chiitan was hired by Square Enix to promote its video game Just Cause 4 by performing and sharing several stunts based on action sequences from the game. These stunts involved the mascot flying into metal boxes, experiencing a wind tunnel, jumping across a gap with the aid of a grappling hook, and jumping from a height while using a number of umbrellas glued together to break its fall.Oh The Japan Times described Chiitan's antics as slapstick, similar in style and content to Jackass. Many of its videos ended up with it lying on the ground after attempting a dangerous physical stunt. Many of Chiitan's videos involved the use of athletic equipment that was sent to it by fans. One video, showing Chiitan kicking an exercise ball, was viewed over eight million times.McGee Chiitan's videos were well-received by many people on the internet, resulting in it becoming \\"the fastest rising star\\" among Japanese mascots in 2018.Chris Some of the social media posts in which Chiitan and Shinjo-kun appeared together led some people to believe that Chiitan was a \\"bad influence\\" on Shinjo-kun. One post, in which Chiitan carries a miniature baseball bat and Shinjo-kun is dressed as a gangster, is captioned: \\"We're the bosses, don't mess with us or we'll commit otterocities.\\" =Media reception= Chiitan's social media posts were controversial, and by January 2019 the government of Susaki had received over 100 complaints from citizens who objected to the city's association with the mascot. Many of the people who complained seem to have mistaken Chiitan with Susaki's official mascot, Shinjo-kun, who looks similar.Ives, January 22, 2019 These complaints led the city to suspend its ties with Chiitan that month. In addition to preventing its officials and official mascot from appearing with Chiitan, the city's mayor, Kosaku Kusunose, requested that Chiitan \\"suspend activities\\" in February, claiming that the mascot was guilty of violating a copyright on the character's image owned by the city and accusing the company managing the character of profiting off of it.Ives, May 17, 2019 In addition to distancing itself from the mascot Chiitan, the city government elected not to renew the real otter Chiitan's status as its honorary tourism ambassador. In spite of the city's request, Chiitan's management company continued to produce media for the character on its social media accounts, leading to the city filing a court case against it in February 2019. After Susaki broke ties with Chiitan, other collaborators also ended their relationship with the character. TV Tokyo suspended the production of an anime it had been making based on the character's adventures, \\"Fairy Chiitan\\". SEGA Games cancelled plans that it had to produce an online game with the character. John Oliver After losing its association with Susaki, Chiitan was the topic of an episode of John Oliver's HBO program, Last Week Tonight. In the episode John Oliver explained how the mascot came to be, and praised its strange and humorous videos as \\"amazing\\", \\"a work of art\\", and \\"virtuosic\\". Oliver then created and sent his own mascot, \\"Chiijohn\\", \\"a 41-year-old nearsighted English fairy baby\\", to Susaki in order to befriend Shinjo-kun. After a short video detailing the friendship between Shinjo-kun and Chiijohn, Oliver confirmed that Chiijohn had been officially accepted by the Susaki government.McClinton Following the segment, Chiitan, via its official Twitter account, stated that it was angry that Oliver had stolen its friend and challenged Oliver to a fight. It tweeted WWE-inspired challenges directed at John Oliver, inviting him to fight it in a \\"NO HOLDS BARRED MATCH\\". In another tweet, Chiitan stated that it \\"wants to give John Oliver a chance to explode through a table\\", and later attempted to enlist Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson to help pressure Oliver. Oliver, in response to Chiitan's posts, tweeted \\"I'm in a public beef with an unsanctioned Japanese otter. I needed this.\\" On May 14, 2019, Twitter suspended Chiitan's Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Arabic, and Turkish accounts. Chiitan's official English account made numerous posts begging for its other accounts to be re-opened. According to the staff responsible for managing Chiitan, they did not receive any warning or notice that Chiitan's accounts would be closed. Speculation about why the accounts may have been closed include the mascot's challenge to fight Oliver (which was intended to be humorous and was understood by Oliver to be so), or the attention brought to its previous posts after it was featured on Oliver's show. By May 20, 2019 Chiitan's two English-language Twitter accounts were also frozen. Chiitan's team created two additional Twitter accounts, @HelpChiitan in English and @Chiitan7407 in Japanese, to lobby for Chiitan's other Twitter accounts to be unfrozen. Celebrities solicited for support included John Oliver and Tony Hawk. There was speculation that Oliver may have been responsible for Chiitan's suspension,St. Michael, May 25, 2019 but a spokesman for HBO said that Oliver's show had no comment on Chiitan's suspension. In addition to the mascot Chiitan's Twitter accounts, the other Twitter accounts managed by Chiitan's management company were also frozen, including that of the real otter Chiitan. Chiitan's social media accounts on other platforms remained unaffected, including Instagram, where it has over 1.6 million followers. Despite the claims of the company managing Chiitan that it produced only \\"healthy\\" content that was neither prejudicial nor malicious, others suggested that the \\"anarchic\\" nature of the mascot's videos was what led to its Twitter accounts' suspension. There was speculation that the suspension was related to the ongoing copyright dispute with the city of Susaki over the mascot's image, but a spokesman for the Susaki city government denied contacting Twitter. One \\"inside source\\" was reported to have said that Chiitan's accounts were banned because it had violated Twitter's rules on spam. Twitter refused to make a statement on the suspensions, saying it was company policy not to comment on private accounts due to security and privacy concerns. On June 5, 2020, Chiitan appeared in a video supporting the Black Lives Matter movement by donating ¬•10,498 to the movement after the death of George Floyd, which gained positive response.https://soranews24.com/2020/06/18/black-lives-matter-protests- receive-support-from-japanese-mascot- chiitan%E3%80%90video%E3%80%91/https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/news/japanese- mascot-chiitan-supports-black-lives-matter-in-this-video-060820 References =Citations= = Sources = * Blaster, Master. \\"Chiitan the Otter Rejected as Mascot Character for Japan's Susaki City due to Reckless Behavior\\".

It comprises a series of limestones, shales and sandstones which accumulated to a thickness of 2400m in the northwest Carboniferous basin of Ireland. The type areas for the group are the Clogher Valley of County Tyrone and the Fermanagh Highlands of nearby County Fermanagh. The rocks of the group sit unconformably on older rocks of the Shanmullagh Formation of the Fintona Group which are the local representatives of the Lower Old Red Sandstone. The top of the Dartry Limestone, the uppermost part of the group, is a disconformity, above which are the layered sandstones and shales of the Meenymore Formation of the Leitrim Group.Geological Survey of Northern Ireland 1991, 1:50,000 scale geological map sheet NI 44,56 and 43 ‚Äò‚ÄôDerrygonelly‚Äô‚Äô https://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=TYRO The succession continues south and west across the border into the Republic of Ireland, though different names are typically applied.

It is also found widely around Sligo Bay to the west. =Benbulben Shale Formation= Known previously as the lower part of the Middle or Calp Limestone and of the Upper Calp Shale, this 60-120m thickness of mudstones with fossil-rich grey limestones and thin calciturbidites and sandstones make up the formationhttps://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=BBSF. The outcrop runs from north of Monaghan towards Upper Lough Erne then north to Maguiresbridge. West of the lough, a broad outcrop runs north to the Derrygonnelly area. From beneath the Cliffs of Magho, the outcrop wraps around the south of Lough Melvin generally west to Glencar Lough. There are further outcrops north of Ederney and running NE-SW through Manorhamilton. =Mullaghmore Sandstone Formation= Variously known in the past as the Middle or Calp Sandstone, Upper Calp (Macnean) Sandstone and Clonelly Sandstone Group, about 200m thickness of brown to grey sandstones interbedded with mudstones and siltstones make up this formationhttps://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=MMS. A thin band extends southwest and northeast from Scotstown in County Monaghan whilst a broader band is found east of Lough Macnean Lower, running north to Derrygonnelly. A narrow outcrop runs northeast-southwest through Manorhamilton. The most extensive area is around Lough Melvin west to Mullaghmore Head and including Inishmurray. A further band wraps south towards Sligo. There are other outcrops west of Ballyshannon, around Mountcharles from Lough Bradan Forest to the shores of Lower Lough Erne. =Bundoran Shale Formation= Known variously in the past as the Middle or Calp Limestone, or Lower and Middle Calp Shales, this 80-450m thickness of dark grey mudstones with layers of bioclastic limestone includes at its base, the Skea Sandstone Member (a.k.a. the Dowra Sandstone Member).https://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=BUNS Its outcrop extends from northeast of Monaghan southwest to Upper Lough Erne, though is largely covered by more recent deposits. A band of these shales extends west of Enniskillen to north of Derrygonnelly. There are broken outcrops around the northern shore of Lower Lough Erne and from the west end of the lough to the coast at Bundoran and further outcrops around the northeast of Donegal Bay. There are more further west between Kinlough and Drumcliff whilst another band runs southwest from Manorhamilton. Occurrences of this rock further south in the Republic of Ireland are known as the Lisgorman Shale Formation. =Ballyshannon Limestone Formation= Formerly known as the Pettigo Limestone Group or the Lower Limestone, this 120-450m thickness of blue-grey limestones with interbeds of silty shale, includes the Gortnaree Sandstone Member at its base.https://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=BAL It outcrops in the country between Clabby and Brookeborough and in a small area east of Aughnacloy.

Peircy Brett, an officer on Lord Anson's round-the-world voyage Sakman, better known in western sources as flying proas, are traditional sailing outrigger boats of the Chamorro people of the Northern Marianas. They are characterized by a single outrigger and a crab claw sail. They are the largest native sailing ships (ladjak) of the Chamorro people. Followed by the slightly smaller lelek and the medium-sized duding. They are similar to other traditional sailing ships of Micronesia, like the wa, baurua, and the walap. These ships were once used for trade and transportation between islands. Description Sakman was a single-outrigger boat. Its basic design consists of a very narrow dugout canoe which served as the main hull, to which an outrigger was attached on one side. The main hull was typically around long, but only around wide and deep. It had a single mast known as the palu, and a steering oar known as the umulin. A platform was usually built on the spars connecting the main hull and the outrigger, which was used to carry cargo and passengers. The hull was typically painted with protective designs in white, black, red, and orange using ochre, lime (afok), and coconut oil and soot. It was rigged with a crab claw sail made from woven mats of pandanus leaves (akgak). The canoes were usually made from dokdok (breadfruit) trees. They were hollowed out and carved by men. The sails (layak) were woven by women. The main hull was asymmetrical on its left and right sides to counteract the drag of the outrigger float. However, it was symmetrical at both ends, which meant the boat can be sailed in reverse. This was a necessity to accomplish the shunting technique, in which the outrigger was always kept windward. This allowed the boats to sail leeward without having to turn the ship. History The sakman were the very first Pacific outrigger boats encountered by Europeans. The Venetian scholar Antonio Pigafetta, who was part of Ferdinand Magellan's 1519‚Äì1522 circumnavigation, mistakenly described the outrigger hull as a \\"small boat fastened astern\\". Magellan's crew were impressed by the ships' speed, maneuverability, and their ability to reverse directions. They were the first accounts that described the sakman as \\"flying.\\" Further accounts by the Spanish described the sakman as being capable of sailing from Guam to Manila in only four days, averaging more than per hour. During his 1740‚Äì1744 circumnavigation, Lord Anson applied the term proa to the sakman. His fleet captured one in 1742, and Lt. Peircy Brett of made a detailed sketch of it. Rev. Richard Walter, chaplain of HMS Centurion, estimated the speed of the sakman at twenty miles per hour (32 km/h). Although aware of earlier Spanish accounts of the boats of the Spanish East Indies, Anson's account was the first detailed description of a sakman to the English-speaking world. These accounts fascinated both the British and American public, ushering in a period of interest in the design by sports sailors. Working from the drawings and descriptions of explorers, western builders often took liberties with the traditional designs, merging their interpretation of native designs with Western boat building methods. Thus this Western \\"proa\\" often diverged radically from the sakman to the point that the only shared feature was the windward/leeward hull arrangement. The Chamorro population was near-decimated during the Spanish colonial period after the ravages of epidemics of European diseases, as well as wars with the Spanish. The Spanish also forbade the sakman to be sailed in open ocean, leading to the eventual erosion of sailing skills. The techniques of building sakman and other traditional sailing ships were lost some time during the 19th century. However, there have been attempts in modern times to revive the sakman traditions. The first sakman to be built after nearly 200 years was the Saina, which was built between 2007 and 2008.

Founded primarily as an independent clothing brand inspired by crust punk and extreme metal, its articles and music projects have gained considerable recognition. CVLT Nation is now based in Vancouver, Canada. The publication focuses on music, art and fashion, especially relating to underground musicians and visual artists of extreme metal, crust punk and punk rock's heavier subgenres. It also features articles on real-life horror stories, such as cults and murders. CVLT Nation's clothing art is either made by them or commissioned from metal and punk tattoo artists, musicians and illustrators around the world, wherein black metal artists play a substantial part. According to Reveron, the company was intended to be international from the beginning and most of its collaborators are from outside the United States.  History  CVLT Nation was founded in 2011 by Sean Reveron and his partner Meghan MacRae. Previously, both were part of the streetwear company RockersNYC from New York and God's Prey from Los Angeles. The couple decided to launch the company after attending an Amebix show in 2010 in Los Angeles, where they \\"felt at home\\" because their fashion and music tastes were based on metal and crust punk, as well as the community of these subcultures, said Reveron, which is at variance with the competitiveness of the fashion industry. Reveron stated that they were \\"trying to build a bridge between the music we love and the clothing we make\\". They started a blog as a complement for the clothing line, which soon became a proper web magazine; according to Arkansas Times, CVLT Nation had become an \\"indispensable metal/punk/hardcore online magazine\\" by 2012. In August 2015, CVLT Nation established the new marketplace site CVLT Nation Bizarre to sell their clothing alongside small-batch goods from other underground companies and record labels.  Music projects  Since its beginning, CVLT Nation has released series of free albums. The \\"Sonic Cathedrals\\" series are mixtapes curated by artists such as Nails, Pallbearer and The Body, who choose songs from bands that influenced them. The \\"Doom Nation\\" series are doom metal mixtapes. In January 2014, the publication began releasing the \\"CVLT Nation Sessions\\" series, which are cover compilation albums of classic recordings by underground artists. Albums covered include Black Sabbath's Master of Reality, Dead Kennedys' Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables, The Cure's Pornography, Black Flag's My War and Sleep's Holy Mountain. The CVLT Nation Sessions have been featured on Episode 67 of the metal and motorcycle podcast Chop N' Roll.  Recognitions  In March 2015, Noisey called CVLT Nation a \\"crucial resource for underground music\\". In March 2019, Czech Radio named it one of the four best independent punk websites, praising the quality of the underground artists featured despite the brand's substantial growth. Dave Cantrell of XRAY.FM credits the darkwave articles of CVLT Nation for the foundation of his radio program Songs From Under the Floorboard and the Out From the Shadows music festival which started in 2018. CVLT Nation's album series have been praised by Kerrang!, Metal Injection and MetalSucks.

It was created after the expulsion of nearly 900 refugees from the high school building they were occupying, in the 19th arrondissement of Paris. The BAAM provides daily support to refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants (French language courses, support with administrative processes... ) but also cultural activities and alerts public opinion and politics in order to improve migrants welcoming in France.  Organization  The Bureau d'Accueil et d'Accompagnement des Migrants was created in 2015 by collectives of informal support and activists after the expulsion of refugees who were occupying the Lyc√©e Jean Quarr√© in Paris. The BAAM is a non-profit association under the French law of 1901, with about 500 members. The BAAM considers itself as a collective which does not act on a humanitarian basis but on a political solidarity. The decision-making is collective and the administrative board is composed of 20 persons: 10 French and 10 migrants (Eritrean, Afghan, Sudanese, Libyan). The association is based in Paris but extensions in other cities are planned  Support actions  The BAAM provides several services to support refugees, asylum- seekers and migrants, among which a legal advice service, social assistance, support in employment search and French language courses. The association also operates and supports refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants in camps and occupied places.  Advocacy  = The French Asylum and Immigration Law (Loi Asile Immigration) = The BAAM was at the origin of an important citizen mobilization against the 'Loi Collomb' (Asylum and Immigration Law). The association sensitizes people in the street by sharing asylum-seekers' experiences and organizes demonstrations to contest the repressive impact of the law. = LGBT+ Refugees = The BAAM's campaign 'Asile, clich√©s et LGBT' (Asylum, clich√©s and LGBT) aims at increasing awareness on the situation of LGBT+ refugees and the prejudices they are suffering from.  Cultural actions  = Cultural centre = In the cultural centre of the BAAM , volunteers organize different workshops (yoga, theatre, music, drawing, etc.) and artistic projects opened to migrants, to create social links and prevent isolation. = BAAM Theatre = Theatre workshops are regularly organized by the BAAM. They gather refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants who choose subjects (e.g. freedom), write texts and work with professionals to produce and perform the plays. They created and publicly performed a one hour act. = BAAM Migrants festival = To increase visibility and raise funds for supporting actions, the BAAM organizes a festival, of which, the first edition will take place on September 7, 2019. Celebrities including Nekfeu, sponsor of the association, the rapper Youssoupha and the singer Jain will perform at this occasion.

Two New Zealanders from the four on the Garhwal Himalaya expedition were invited to join the 1951 British expedition; Ed Cotter declined, but Riddiford and George Lowe argued about who should go. The two had to pay their own way but Lowe was broke, so Riddiford and Edmund Hillary (who had money from working on a South Island hydroelectric project) joined. The leader of the 1952 British Cho Oyu expedition was Eric Shipton, who was disorganised and left the ordering of supplies to Riddiford. But Riddiford injured his back on Cho Oyo (while rolling rocks down the mountain with the Sherpas) so did not return to the Himalayas. He climbed in New Zealand until the 1970s, when he experienced heart problems (angina attacks). Riddiford was a cousin of MP Dan Riddiford, who helped the family financially when his father, Frederick Earle Riddiford (1890‚Äì1921), died aged 33 in a woolshed accident. He was able to go to Hadlow School; then Wanganui Collegiate School (1935‚Äì1938). He studied law at the University of Canterbury and then practiced law in Christchurch. He served in the 2NZEF in World War II, with Army Intelligence in the Pacific. He climbed in Canterbury from 1941, when he climbed Mount Sefton. In 1952 he was asked to join the Wellington law firm his uncle was in. Later he became a partner in the law firm. With his wife Rosemary, he bought the 3850 ha Orongorongo (sheep) Station between Pencarrow Head and Palliser Bay (previously owned by the Riddiford family from 1845, and now a tourist lodge) in 1963, and farmed it until 1986, commuting to the Wairarapa in the weekends. He died in Wellington, and was survived by his wife Rosemary (n√©e Johnston) and four children.

An author of science fiction literature, she received the 2020 Hugo Award for Best Novel for her debut novel A Memory Called Empire (2019). Academic career Weller obtained a bachelor of arts in religious studies at the University of Chicago in 2007, a M.St. in classical Armenian studies at the University of Oxford in 2013, and a Ph.D. in medieval Byzantine, global, and comparative history at Rutgers University in 2014.

She was a visiting assistant professor of history at St. Thomas University from 2014‚Äì15 and a postdoctoral researcher at Uppsala University from 2015‚Äì17. She has published writings on the topic of Byzantine and medieval Armenian history. Fiction writing As Arkady Martine, Weller has been publishing science fiction short fiction since 2012. =A Memory Called Empire= Martine's first novel, A Memory Called Empire, published in 2019, is the beginning of her Teixcalaan series. It is set in a future where the Teixcalaanli empire governs most of human space, and is about to absorb Lsel, an independent mining station. Lsel ambassador Mahit Dzmare is sent to the imperial capital to prevent this, and finds herself embroiled in the empire's succession crisis. Martine said that the book was in many respects a fictional version of her postdoctoral research on Byzantine imperialism on the frontier to Armenia in the 11th century, particularly the annexation of the Kingdom of Ani. In The Verge, Andrew Liptak praised the novel as a \\"brilliant blend of cyberpunk, space opera, and political thriller\\", highlighting Martine's characterization and worldbuilding. In Locus, Russell Letson appreciated the novel's \\"absorbing and sometimes challenging blend of intrigue and anthropological imagination\\", as well as its sense of humor. Publishers Weekly and Kirkus Reviews both gave the novel a starred review, noting the facility with which Martine brought the worlds of her \\"gorgeously crafted diplomatic space opera\\" to life, and comparing Martine's novel to the works of Ann Leckie and Yoon Ha Lee. The novel was nominated for the 2019 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 2020 Locus Award for Best First Novel. It won the 2020 Hugo Award for Best Novel and was shortlisted for the 2020 Arthur C.

It follows Mahit Dzmare, the ambassador from Lsel Station to the Teixcalaanli Empire, as she investigates the death of her predecessor and the instabilities that underpin that society. The book won the 2020 Hugo Award for Best Novel. Synopsis When the Teixcalaanli Empire asks that Yskander Aghavn, the ambassador from Lsel Station, be replaced, Lsel sends Mahit Dzmare ‚Äî who, like Yskander, is a devotee of Teixcalaanli culture. Mahit secretly has within her brain an \\"imago machine\\" with a recording of Yskander's memories and consciousness so that he may guide her; however, shortly after their arrival on Teixcalaan, the machine malfunctions, and Yskander no longer responds. With the aid of her cultural liaison Three Seagrass and Imperial advisor Nineteen Adze, Mahit discovers the connections between the original Yskander's death and the looming Teixcalaanli succession crisis ‚Äî and the threat of a civil war, in which Lsel Station could be a target for annexation. Major themes In the New York Times, Amal el-Mohtar reported that the novel explores the intersection between our past and future selves. It looks at language, grammar, and custom, things that are intertwined with the politics of conquest and the broader culture. The Verge observed that the book discusses how institutional memory guides society and shapes politics, and provides insight into the ideas of conquest and colonialism by comparing the different worldviews of the expansion-minded Teixcalaanli Empire and the fiercely independent Lsel Stationers. Tor.com emphasised the degree to which Mahit is perceived as a \\"barbarian\\" by the Teixcalaanli. Reception The novel received positive reviews from critics. Publishers Weekly gave the novel a starred review, calling it a \\"gorgeously crafted space opera\\" and praising the book's worldbuilding and backstory. Kirkus Reviews called the novel \\"a confident beginning\\" and compared it positively to the works of Ann Leckie and Yoon Ha Lee. A reviewer for The New York Times called the novel \\"a mesmerizing debut, sharp as a knife.\\" Andrew Liptak called it \\"an excellent, gripping novel with a brisk plot, outstanding characters, and plenty to think about long after it‚Äôs over.\\" A reviewer for Tor.com called it \\"a stunning debut\\", praising its worldbuilding, characterization, and subtlety.

Early life Coates was born in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. As an infant he moved with his family to Australia and initially spent two years living in Cairns before settling on the Gold Coast. He attended Marymount College throughout his upbringing and began pursuing an athletics career in primary school. His goal was to represent Papua New Guinea at the Olympics but former NRL player and Marymount teacher Matt Geyer convinced Coates to pursue a career in rugby league instead.  Junior Career  Xavier Coates played his junior football at Currumbin Eagles on the Gold Coast, the same club as Ben Ikin. Xavier commenced rugby league in 2010 as a 9 yo and played junior rugby league at the Eagles until 2018 where he was instrumental in the Currumbin Eagles U17 Premiership under the watchful eye of coach, ex Melb Storm player Matt Geyer. Xavier's rugby league development is anything but conventional. Xavier never made an underage representative team, being over looked on multiple occasions. This culminated in 2016, where he nearly gave up rugby league to pursue his other love, athletics and his dream of being an olympian. The calling of rugby league was too strong for Coates and he returned to the field in the Currumbin Eagles Undefeated Premiership winning U16 team in 2017. This was to be pivotal as on a cold May evening with the Currumbin Eagles playing the Helensvale Hornets a Brisbane Bronco's talent scout had come to view the game as several young Bronco's contracted players were playing including Tom Dearden. The scout only had eyes for one player after the game, Xavier. After being signed to the Bronco's Xavier was invited to the Bronco's summer camp where he impressed coaches and trainers and was selected in the 2018 Qld emerging U18 Origin Squad despite being 16 years old and never having played a representative game. Xavier was selected in the 2018 U18 Qld State of Origin side who went down to NSW 16-10. In 2019 Xavier was fast tracked to senior rugby league with him dominating for his Community Football senior club the Currumbin Eagles. He also excelled in the Qld Major Competition U18 Mal Meninga Cup with the Tweed Heads Seagulls and Intrust Super Cup with the Redcliffe Dolphins. Xavier did make brief appearances for the Tweed Heads Seagulls ISC team, however not being a contracted Titans player saw him transfer to Bronco's feeder club the Dolphins. Xavier was finally selected for his first ever junior representative team in the 2018 U18 South Coast team and the U18 Qld School Boys and once again was selected in the Qld emerging U18 Origin Squad and played in the U18 QLD State of Origin against NSW, where QLD won the game 34 - 12 and with Xavier named Man of the Match. Xavier was also inline for a 2019 U20 QLD Origin debut when opportunity came knocking from the PNG Kumuls and subsequently his NRL debut. Senior Career Coates made his international debut for Papua New Guinea in their 24‚Äì6 defeat by Samoa in the 2019 Oceania Cup. In round 16 of the 2019 NRL season, Coates made his debut for the Brisbane Broncos against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, scoring a try. Coates made twelve appearances for Brisbane in the 2020 NRL season, a year which saw Brisbane come last for the first time their history.

She had three sisters and three brothers including General Sir Montagu Gilbert Gerard (1842‚Äì1905). Dorothea Gerard was also descended from Alexander Gerard (1728‚Äì1795) a philosophical writer, Archibald Alison (1757‚Äì1839) a Scottish Episcopalian minister and writer, and Gilbert Gerard (1760‚Äì1815) a minister of the Church of Scotland and theological writer. Her sister Emily Gerard born in 1849 at Chesters, Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, Scotland was also a novelist, and the two collaborated on several novels. The family background was originally Scottish Episcopalian, but when their mother converted to Catholicism in 1848 her children were raised as Catholic. In the 1861 Scotland Census, Dorothea is recorded as living at Rochsoles House in Lanarkshire with her parents, her sisters Anne, Emily and Mary, and a staff of 11 servants; they also have several visitors happening to stay at the house at the time of the census-taker's visit.Parish: New Monkland; ED: 8; Page: 4; Line: 9; Roll: CSSCT1861_117.

General Register Office for Scotland, Edinburgh, Scotland. The Gerard family lived in Vienna from 1863 to 1866. Dorothea was home-schooled until the death of her mother in 1870 at which time her older and now married sister Emily assumed custody of her and Dorothea joined her sister in Austria where she continued her education studying European languages at the convent of the Sacr√© Coeur at Riedenburg in Austria. The two sisters Dorothea and Emily became active participants in the British literary community in the latter half of the nineteenth century, both working collaboratively and independently. Collaboration with Emily Gerard In 1877 Dorothea began to write novels, with her first major work being a collaboration with her sister Emily Gerard under the joint pseudonym E. D. Gerard. Reata; or What's in a Name (1880) concerned a Mexican girl's attempts to adapt to European customs and was published in Blackwood‚Äôs Magazine. Three subsequent novels published by the pair in the same magazine were Beggar My Neighbour (1882), The Waters of Hercules (1885), and A Sensitive Plant (1891). Referring to one of their joint novels, The Saturday Review called them \\"one of the most fascinating of our lady novelists.\\"Vesna Goldsworthy, Inventing Ruritania: The Imperialism of the Imagination, Yale University Press (1998) ‚Äì Google Books pg. 61 Marriage and after On 12 April 1887 at Marburg Dorothea Gerard married Captain (later Major-General) Julius Longard of the 7th Austrian LancersDorothea Gerard - 'Portraits of Celebrities' - The Strand Magazine - No. 25, Vol V, January to June 1893 pg. 59 in the Austro-Hungarian Army following which she spent much of her subsequent life in Austria and Galicia in Eastern Europe where she also set many of her novels, many of which involved romantic liaisons between European nobility.Lorna Sage, Germaine Greer, Elaine Showalter, The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English, Cambridge University Press (1999) ‚Äì Google Books pg. 269 Following her marriage Gerard feared losing her native tongue and read and wrote in English as much as possible.Bette Lynn London, Double: Women's Literary Partnerships, Cornell University Press (1999) - Google Books pg. 122 In 1894 her husband was awarded the title 'Longard de Longgarde'. Together they had a daughter, Doroth√©e Stanislaw Julia (1888‚Äì1943). Following her marriage her collaboration with her sister Emily ceased and Dorothea Gerard became successful as a writer of novels in her own right, including Recha, Etelka's Vow and A Queen of Curds and Cream. Her tale 'My Nightmare', from her book of short stories On The Way Through (1892), has been anthologised several times in collections of Victorian horror and suspense.Hugh Lamb, Victorian Nightmares, Coronet Books (1977) pg. 133Hugh Lamb, A Bottomless Grave: And Other Victorian Tales of Terror, Dover Publications, Inc., (1977) - Google Books pg. 133Classic Tales of Horror, Audible Audiobook, The Story Circle Ltd. (2010), ASIN: B003EN3K34 As Dorothea Longard de Longgarde she became arguably the more successful and certainly the more prolific novelist of the two sisters, so much so that in 1893 she was interviewed for 'Portraits of Celebrities at Different Ages' in The Strand Magazine. Dorothea Gerard died after a long illness aged 60 in September 1915 in Vienna where she had been living in strict retirement for some years.

He had a successful career in La Liga in the 1980s and 90s, making over 200 appearances in the competition, including a five-year stint with Atl√©tico Madrid. Career G√≥mez was born in Eibar in the Gipuzkoa province of the Basque Country, and was a member of the youth teams of SD Eibar. However, he turned professional in 1983 with the significantly more famous local team Athletic Bilbao. He spent two years in the reserve team, which included a brief loan spell with Lleida, before making his debut for the senior team in 1985. This came on 13 October in a 3-3 home draw against Real Valladolid at the San Mam√©s Stadium, which would be his only appearance of the season. His second full season with Bilbao was much more successful, making 40 appearances in all competitions. He also made his European debut, in a 2-0 home UEFA Cup win against East Germany's 1. FC Magdeburg on 17 September 1986. He also scored his first and only goal for Bilbao in this match. He played in all four matches in the competition as Bilbao were knocked out by Beveren of Belgium in the second round. At the end of the season, G√≥mez left Bilbao and joined Osasuna. His debut for his new club was on 6 September 1987, in a 0-0 away draw with Real Sociedad at the Atotxa Stadium. He made his home debut a week later in a 4-1 win against Real Valladolid at the El Sadar Stadium. He had a successful season, making 33 appearances, and he scored Osasuna's goal in a 3-1 defeat to Atl√©tico Madrid at the Vicente Calder√≥n Stadium on 6 December. The following season was equally successful, as he made a further 33 appearances, and netted an impressive six goals. This impressive form led to a move to Spanish giants Atl√©tico Madrid in 1989. He made his debut on 2 September in a 3-1 win at Valencia's Mestalla Stadium, and his first appearance at the Vicente Calder√≥n Stadium came a week later in a 1-0 win over C√°diz CF. He made 37 appearances in a strong first season for Los Rojiblancos, but he struggled to maintain this success. 17 games the following year was followed by just two in 1991-92, and by January of that season he was out of favour to such an extent that he was sent out on loan to Espanyol. He made his Espanyol debut on 26 January in a 2-0 home win over Real Sociedad at the Sarri√† Stadium, and he scored his first goal on 15 March in a 3-1 home win against C√°diz CF. His loan stint proved successful, as he made 16 appearances and scored 3 times before returning to Atleti. He was hopeful of securing a first team place at Atl√©tico, but appeared just once before being sent out on loan again. However, this appearance did allow him to score his first goal for the club, in a 6-1 Cup Winners' Cup demolition of Slovenia's Maribor at the Vicente Calder√≥n on 30 September 1992. His loan began in October, this time to fellow Madrid club Rayo Vallecano, and lasted until the end of the season. His first game for the club was a 1-1 draw at Real Oviedo's Estadio Carlos Tartiere on 18 October. He made his home debut came a week later, coincidentally against his parent club. The match at Nuevo Estadio de Vallecas ended with an excellent 2-0 win for the hosts. He ultimately made 30 appearances for Rayo before returning once again to Madrid at the end of the season. This time he was able to fight for a first team spot, and made 31 appearances during 1993-94, scoring once. However, this would prove to be his last season in La Liga, as he returned to Osasuna in the summer of 1994, who were by now competing in the Segunda Divisi√≥n. He spent two years with the Pamplona club, before joining Segunda Divisi√≥n rivals and hometown club SD Eibar in 1996. After one year with Eibar, he finished his career with a season playing in Segunda Divisi√≥n B with CD Izarra, retiring in 1998.

It originates in the School of Political and Social Sciences founded by Jules Van den Heuvel in Louvain in 1892. With over 6000 students, it is UCLouvain's largest faculty.  History  In 1892 and 1897, two schools were founded within the Faculty of Law of the Catholic University of Louvain: the School of Political and Social Sciences and the School of Commercial and Consular Sciences. These new schools attempt to meet the challenges of industrial, political and scientific revolutions and train those who will engage in the conduct of the economy and social life. It was for these same reasons that the √âcole sup√©rieure commerciale et consulaire was founded in 1896 in La Louvi√®re. This independent institution moved to Mons in 1899, obtained university status and eventually merged with UCLouvain in 2011. Closely associated with each other, the two schools of UCLouvain will not stop reinventing and reorganizing themselves over time to keep pace with the changes in society and the development of the human and social sciences. They will be reorganized into different institutes, schools, faculties, departments (among others), focused on both practical teaching and advanced research. The latter was notably materialized by the creation of the Institute of Economics, the future Institute of Economic and Social Research (IRES), in 1928. In 1908, the year of the transfer of Congo to the Belgian state, the School of Commercial and Consular Sciences started a degree in colonial sciences. After the First World War, it took on different names, including the √âcole sup√©rieure de commerce. In 1934, it was approved as a Higher Institute of Commerce (√âcole sup√©rieure de commerce) by Royal Decree. In 1941, Rector Van Waeyenbergh entrusted Jacques Leclercq with its reorganization. The School of Economics is founded, with four institutes: in addition to IRES, we find the Institute of Economics, the Institute of Applied Economics (ISEA), and the Institute of Actuarial Sciences. In 1950, the School of Political and Social Sciences and the School of Economics split from the Faculty of Law to become a fully-fledged faculty: the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences. It becomes one of the largest faculties in terms of student numbers. In 1961, the Institute for Development Studies was created. In 1967, the faculty changed its name to the Faculty of Economic, Social and Political Sciences. In 1975, when moving from Leuven to Louvain-la-Neuve, the faculty was reorganized into 9 departments. The ISEA became the Institute of Administration and Management (IAG), while communication, demography, European studies and labour sciences appear as departments. The faculty is further reorganized several times during the 1980s and 1990s, with notably the creation of a department of sociology. Within the framework of the Bologna Process, the French Community decree of 31 March 2004 leads to the creation of bachelor's degrees for the first cycle of higher education in 2004, and master's degrees for the second cycle in 2007. In 2008, the IAG becomes autonomous under the name of Louvain School of Management, which two years later become a fully separate faculty. In 2010, on the occasion of the internal reform of the UCLouvain, which separates teaching and research activities, the faculty became the Faculty of Economic, Social and Political Sciences and Communication. The faculty's researchers integrate different research institutes. = Hainaut = In 2011, following the merger between the Facult√©s universitaires catholiques de Mons (FUCaM) and UCLouvain, the ESPO faculty became a 'multi-site', established in Louvain-la-Neuve, Mons and Charleroi. = Brussels = Though strongly related, the Faculty of Economic, Social, Political and Communication Sciences (also abbreviated ESPO) of UCLouvain Saint-Louis Brussels, is a distinct and autonomous faculty founded in 1965, located on Saint-Louis University's main campus, in the center of Brussels.

The Louvain School of Journalism also includes classes at the IAD film school in Louvain-la-Neuve (Institut des arts de diffusion). In addition to this, the Louvain School of Journalism offers a double Master degree in Press and Information and another double Master degree in Media Literacy with the IHECS Brussels School of Journalism in Brussels. The Louvain School of Journalism is associated with Media and Journalism Research Observatory (ORM), a research group within the UCLouvain School of Communication, and collaborates intensively with the Research Centre on Mediation (University of Lorraine) and the Academy of Journalism and Media (University of Neuch√¢tel). The Louvain School of Journalism is the founding member of the arppej network, the International Research Alliance for Journalism Education and Practice. = Main awarded degrees = All are organised in Louvain-la-Neuve, except stated otherwise.

The slang noun kkondae was originally used by students and teenagers to refer to older people such as fathers and teachers. Recently, however, the word has been used to refer to a boss or an older person who does so-called kkondae-jil (acting like a kkondae, in the Korean language), that forces the former's outdated way of thinking onto another person.  Etymology  There are two competing arguments on the origin of kkondae. The first theory claims that the word kondaegi, which means a pupa in the South Gyeongsang Province dialect, is the origin: The folded skin of a pupa reminds the wrinkles of an old man, so the word might have become a representation of an old man. The other theory suggests the French nobility title :fr:comte (count) is the basis of the word kkondae. During the Japanese occupation of Korea, pro-Japanese politicians such as Lee Wan-yong received nobility titles from the Japanese government. They proudly called themselves kkondae, hence it might have been developed into a slang later. = The late 20th century = Originally, the word kkondae meant simply an old man in a profane way. During the late 1960s when industrialization and westernization were in full swing in South Korea, the word also began to refer to (classroom) teachers. Students, who were not satisfied with the outdated school environment, would dismiss teachers from the older generation as old-fashioned beings. Hence, the word kkondae became a slang used by students.  Cause  The Society of Korea is holding the radical development of, and going to a rapidly changing society by innovation increasingly reduced the area which can resonate between the generations. This is not simply a matter of generation gap. This issue has a lot to do with media, technological advances, and globalization. It is also worth noting that there are emerging generations in which growth is delayed. This is one of the backgrounds of discourse. It means that there are a lot of people who are not satisfied with the social norm of being grown up. This is also a structural problem. When the average life span was short, people accept and adapt quickly went to the social demands. But while human life began to increase gradually, people began to slow in marriage, career, academic and forms part of this interaction paradigm and the kkondae.  Social phenomenon  The word 'kkondae' is becoming increasingly problematic in society. If people who know something more try to tell people they do not know, the people who receive the information sometimes think of such behavior as robust. So now people try to notice or refrain from behaving to tell others about what they experience and know first. When the image of human being is formed, people around them tend to look at the person with a negative gaze and think of it as a person who thinks behind the times. These problems are not only seen by people who are older and have experienced much. Now, as people look at people who are different from themselves with negative perceptions, the meaning of kkondae is getting wider and the people living in Korean society tend not to push or persuade their opinions and thoughts compared to the past. This may be a good thing, but from a different point of view, freedom of expression is gradually disappearing in that it can not express its opinions and thoughts frankly.  Influence  As the word 'kkondae' came along, people began to refrain from acting on themselves and their thoughts to force others to agree. Also, people with older or more life experiences tend to try to understand young cultures, and a combination of older generations and current generations of cultures is emerging. This phenomenon appears in various areas. For example, there are music, TV programs, and fashion. = Music = The combination of the atmosphere of old songs and the current trendy songs is producing the area of new music. In addition, the old singer and the current singer work together to work on harmonious songs. This phenomenon is a combination of the old generation and the young generation at the same time, and it can embrace various groups and people. = TV programs = TV programs are also being affected a lot. Regulations on broadcasting have been relaxed much, and positive suggestions have begun to be made, not to interpret negative trends in the current phenomenon. When the performers come out of the TV program and play a game, try Dutch pie, or try new things, they used to make such a negative TV program, but now it is a very natural phenomenon. = Fashion = The old generation tended to look strange about the fashionable clothes and accessories. Recently, however, the old generation have been looking at trendy clothes, hair styles, and accessories positively and looking at them. In addition, old fashion trends are forming new trends in combination with popular fashion trends, which is evidence that fashion is developing over time.  Current situation  The young man blames the lame, the old man grudges the young people. Recently They are often asked to ask questions or to ask questions about their loyalty. It's been used as a profanity for a long time. But at some point it will be an important social keyword. The word 'kkondae' refers to the teacher as a whole. There has been a remarkable change between expanding to general. The discourse of the younger generations is not only a problem for adults but also for seniors and even friends of department and club.  Solution  If kkondae does not become a social problem, first, the definition of kkondae should be understood by the people living in the present society. Also, the concept of kkondae changes gradually as the age changes and society changes. Therefore, people need to pay attention to the change in meaning of kkondae. Otherwise, discrepancies between differences between generations, or disagreements with others, may increase. So what is kkondae, kkondae should be precisely framed. Furthermore, kkondae does not have to be definite as a socially accepted term. In the media, news, and TV programs that people come across, people have to be careful about the concept of kkondae to convey information to people. Media is a means of controlling people's thinking in one era. Therefore, those concerned with the media should be concerned about how kkondae will be seen by people, and should be involved in the formation of desirable meanings. In addition, educational institutions can also participate in this phenomenon and solve problems with kkondae. People learn the skills and knowledge to adapt to society at school. Educational institutions are not just places to learn and communicate knowledge. Educational institutions are places where people develop their ability to go and adapt to society. Therefore, educational institutions should clearly tell students the concept of 'kkondae'.

Biography Donati was born in Budrio, a small town of medieval origin 17 km from Bologna (Italy). After high school, he enrolled in the faculty of physics at the University of Bologna, but, after two years, he decided to dedicate himself to the study of society and enrolled in the faculty of Political Sciences in the same university, where he got his M.A. degree in 1970. Then he went to the University of Milan to do a research for the National Research Council Italy (CNR) on Italian entrepreneurship. In the years 1974-78 he attended the summer school of the ECPR at the University of Essex (UK). In 1980 he became full professor of sociology. In the years 1970-2016 he taught many different subjects in the fields of sociology, social theory, and social policy, in particular sociology of the family, health, citizenship, welfare, social capital, social services. In the same years, he lectured at the universities of Geneva, Gratz, Harvard, Chicago, Paris Sorbonne, Warsaw, Moscow, Navarra. In the years 1995-1998 he served as President of the Italian Sociological Association, and during the mandate 2001-2005 he served as Counsellor and Auditor of the Board of the International Institute of Sociology. In 1997 he was appointed member of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences. He has received the Doctorate Honoris Causa from the Lateran University (Rome) in 2009 and from the Universitat Internacional de Catalunya (Barcelona) in 2017 for his studies on the family and social policy. Acknowledged by the United Nations as IYF PATRON (1994), in 2009 he has received the San Benedetto Prize for the promotion of Life in Europe and in 2015 the Cheryl Frank Memorial Prize for the book The Relational Subject, Cambridge University Press. Works Donati‚Äôs researches started with the idea of building a useful sociology to reform society according to a humanistic perspective. Actually, his writings became a long journey of reflections on the vicissitudes of modernity, its institutions, movements and ideologies, up to claiming that modernity dies and a new, after(not post)-modern society is born. =General overview= The starting point for searching a new theory was that of overcoming the theories that were dominant in the 1960s and 1970s. It was the time when sociology was elaborated within the framework of the nation-state and the welfare state understood as a compromise between capitalistic market and political democracy. The issue at stake, for sociology, was to understand the possible evolution of that sort of society. The primal intention of Donati‚Äôs works was to revise the Parsonian theory on society and modernity. It was about building a good theory of society by avoiding Parsons‚Äô mistakes, notably the one to consider a model of society (the North-American one) as the most advanced (therefore the best) in a supposed evolutionary scale. On this line, it was necessary to find also a way out of all forms of neo-functionalism, e.g. J.C. Alexander‚Äôs and N. Luhmann‚Äôs theories. The analytical realism proposed by Parsons (The Structure of Social Action, 1937) offered an interesting base of departure, but it was totally insufficient and misleading inasmuch as it ended building a constructivist, rather than realistic, sociology. For Donati, sociological realism should become critical and relational..As Archer has rightly underlined, Donati‚Äôs sociology it was from its inception an autonomous version of critical realism: see Margaret S. Archer (2010). ‚ÄúCritical Realism and Relational Sociology. Complementarity and Synergy.‚Äù Journal of Critical Realism, 9 (2), pp. 199-207. Therefore, Donati left Parsons' analytical realism in his ‚ÄòIntroduzione alla sociologia relazionaleP. Donati (1986), Introduzione alla sociologia relazionale, FrancoAngeli, Milano, (second enlarged edition) pp. 226‚Äô (first edition 1983) and subsequently in ‚ÄòTeoria relazionale della societ√†P. Donati (1991), Teoria relazionale della societ√†, FrancoAngeli, Milano, 1991, pp. 580.‚Äô. =The 'Relational Society'= Donati‚Äôs sociology is oriented to show how a ‚Äòrelational society‚Äô is constantly emerging through a morphogenetic process. To him, society is not a space ‚Äòcontaining‚Äô relations, but rather the very tissue of relations (society ‚Äòis relation‚Äô and does not ‚Äòhave relations‚Äô). Relations are necessary, while their form is contingentEmmanuele Morandi (2010). ‚ÄúIntroductory Outlines to Pierpaolo Donati‚Äôs Relational sociology. Part 1.‚Äù Journal of Critical Realism, Vol. 9, No. 2, pp. 208-226; Emmanuele Morandi (2011). ‚ÄúIntroductory Outlines to Pierpaolo Donati‚Äôs Relational sociology. Part 2.‚Äù Journal of Critical Realism, Vol. 10, No. 1, pp. 100-121.. That‚Äôs why societies can take many different forms. They emerge as a ‚Äòthird‚Äô in respect to the agents/actors (the ‚Äòthird‚Äô is here understood as the Wechselwirkung according to Georg Simmel). To summarize. Any social formation is the emergent effect of reciprocal actions, reiterated over time by social actors/subjects occupying different positions in a societal configuration (system or social network). Society is any social formation generated by virtue of social mechanisms that are relational and reflexive. While the ‚ÄúRelational Subject‚Äù is characterized by personal reflexivity (as defined by Margaret Archer)Porpora, Douglas V. (2016). ‚ÄúThe Relational Subject.‚Äù Journal of Critical Realism, 15 (4), pp. 419-425., the ‚Äòrelational society‚Äô is characterized what Donati calls ‚Äòrelational reflexivity‚Äô, which is different in kind from the inner reflexivity of the individualRelational reflexivity consists in orientating the agents/actors to the reality emergent from their interactions by their taking into consideration how this reality is able (by virtue of its own powers) to feed back onto the subjects (agents/actors) since it exceeds their individual as well as their aggregated personal powers. Margaret Archer attributes to Pierpaolo Donati the proper concept of ‚Äòrelational reflexivity‚Äô: see Martin Dyke (2015). ‚ÄúReconceptualising learning as a form of relational reflexivity.‚Äù British Journal of Sociology of Education, 36(4): 542-557, quote p. 554.. In other words, each and every society is characterized by a special relation‚Äôs form, what Donati calls ‚Äòsocial molecule‚Äô. Modernity has its typical relational form (modern social molecule), and so it is equally for post-modernity (post-modern social molecule). Donati speaks of an after-modern society to indicate a relational society endowed with a new social molecule. The ‚Äòrelational society‚Äô is described as a morphogenetic societyP. Donati (2014). Morphogenic Society and the Structure of Social Relations, in M.S. Archer (ed.), Late Modernity. Trajectories towards Morphogenic Society, Dordrecht, Springer, pp. 143-172; P. Donati (2013). Sociologia relazionale. Come cambia la societ√†. Brescia: La Scuola.. The social relation‚Äôs target/goal is to select variations according to the type and degree of relationality that they entail, with a view to producing ‚Äòrelational goods‚ÄôP. Donati (2019). Discovering the Relational Goods: Their Nature, Genesis and Effects, in ‚ÄúInternational Review of Sociology‚Äù, June 2019 (preprint) DOI 10.1080/03906701.2019.1619952; the means for achieving the goal can be extremely diverse, but they must be such as to allow for the production of relational goods; the after-modern social molecule‚Äôs norms promote meta- reflexivity in so far as they involve the search for a non-fungible quality in social relations; the relation‚Äôs guiding distinction is its difference in terms of ‚Äòvalue‚Äô, that is, the relation is evaluated on the basis of the meaningful experience that it can offer in contrast to what can be offered by other types of relations. In a nutshell, for Donati this new social molecule gains ground if and to the extent that the primacy of the adaptive function is replaced by the criterion of the cultural value of social relationality. This is the concrete utopia of the ‚Äúrelational society‚ÄùP. Donati (2018). El sue√±o de una sociedad relacional: trayectorias hacia una vida social buena. In Juan Carlos Scannone (ed.), Sociedad Civil y Bien Com√∫n. Hacia una nueva articulaci√≥n del Mercado, el Estado y la Sociedad Civil, C√≥rdoba: Editorial de la Universidad Cat√≥lica de C√≥rdoba pp. 167-220; P. Donati (ed.) (2018), Towards a Participatory Society: New Roads to Social and Cultural Integration, Vatican City: Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences (online)., which is meant to be subsidiary to the human being. It is subsidiary if and when it develops the virtuous qualities of the human being through proper social relations, i.e. when it configures relations in order to enhance the positively synergetic relationality (instead of humiliation or exploitation) between Ego and Alter. The symbolic code of subsidiarity differentiates itself from other ones (functionalist or of other kind), because it does not confer the primacy to a systemic function, but to the dignity of the human being. Donati's sociology can be viewed as quite close to the versions based on network analysis (like Nick Crossley's)Nick Crossley (2016). ‚ÄòSocial Networks and Relational Sociology.‚Äô In Seth Abrutyn (ed.), Handbook of Contemporary Sociological Theory, Dordrecht: Springer, pp, 167-183; Luigi Tronca (2013). Sociologia relazionale e social network analysis. Analisi delle strutture sociali. Milano: FrancoAngeli., while it is in radical disagreement with the sociologies that Donati defines as ‚Äòrelationalist‚Äô (instead of relational), meaning relativist, pragmatist, processualist, characterized by a flat ontology, like Jan Fuhse‚ÄôsRuggieri, Davide (2014). ‚ÄúFuhse and Donati on relational sociology: beyond the structural view of social networks.‚Äù Sociologia e Politiche Sociali, Vol. 17, No. 1, pp. 51-70., Fran√ßois D√©pelteau‚Äôs, Chris Powell‚ÄôsChristopher Powell, & Fran√ßois D√©pelteau, eds.

The importance of the ontological perspective goes back to the humanistic interests with which Donati started his journey, and is now reflected in the issue of how to trace the distinctions between the human beings and hybrids, actants, post-humans, trans-humans, smart sentient robotsP. Donati (2019). Transcending the human: Why, where, and how?. In Ismael Al-Amoudi & Jamie Morgan (eds.), Realist Responses to Post-Human Society: Ex Machina, Abingdon: Routledge, pp. 53-81.. His perspective must now confront the advent of the digital era with the increasing influence of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics as generator of different kinds of social relationsP. Donati (2017). ‚ÄúThe Good Life as a Sharing of Relational Goods.‚Äù Relational Social Work, vol. 1, n. 2, pp. 5-25.. In the years 2000-2018 Donati intensified the convergence with critical realism, which he had already adopted since the research of the 1970s, and with the idea of social morphogenesis, applied to topics such as family, business, associations, citizenship, civil society. Being a critical realist, his work has been criticised by other relational sociologists adopting different approaches, such as Fran√ßois D√©pelteau and Chris Powell, Gholam Reza Azarian and Jan Fuhse. However Mathieu Deflem asked him for an autobiography for the book ‚ÄòSociologists in a Global Age. Biographical Perspectives‚Äô. In recent years, Donati has pursued the intention of constructing a \\"relational theory of society\\" that is clearly distinct from what he calls ‚Äòrelationalist sociologies‚Äô, meaning those sociologies that profess cultural, ethical relativism and reduce relationships to pure procedural flows. With Simon Laflamme, Doug Porpora and many other sociologists, he insists on the difference between the \\"relational\\" approach (which is based on a stratified ontology) and \\"relationalist\\" approaches (which support a flat ontology) for social sciences. This difference is the badrock for new studies on human relations vis-√†-vis the spreading of artificial intelligence and robotics. Publications Donati has published more than 800 works.

In the standard numbering of the chapters of book 3, it comprises chapters 257‚Äì75.Avadesh Kumar Singh, \\"Ramayana in the Mahabharata: A Study of 'Ramopakhyayana' in the Mahabharata\\", in Textuality and Inter-textuality in the Mahabharata: Myth, Meaning and Metamorphosis, ed. by Pradeep Trikha (New Delhi: Sarup & Sons, 2006), pp. 32-38 (p. 33). At the beginning of the Ramopakhyana section of the Mahabharata, the character Yudhishthira has just suffered the abduction of his wife and been exiled to the forest. Asking whether there has ever been someone more unfortunate than himself, he is told the comparable story of Rama and Sita as a moralising tale, counselling him against despair.Avadesh Kumar Singh, \\"Ramayana in the Mahabharata: A Study of 'Ramopakhyayana' in the Mahabharata\\", in Textuality and Inter-textuality in the Mahabharata: Myth, Meaning and Metamorphosis, ed. by Pradeep Trikha (New Delhi: Sarup & Sons, 2006), pp. 32-38 (p. 34).

In 1825, during the Greek War of Independence and Greek civil wars of 1823-1825, the U.S. Navy conducted anti-piracy operations in the Aegean Sea. Greece and the Aegean were controlled by the Ottomans until Greece achieved independence in 1829. The first draft of the Monroe Doctrine, written in 1823, included a passage praising the Greek revolutionaries, though the passage was ultimately removed. In 1831 the U.S. sent its first formally approved envoy to the Ottoman Empire, David Porter.Sinan Kuneralp, \\"Ottoman Diplomatic and Consular Personnel in the United States of America, 1867‚Äì1917.\\" (2001) p. 100 online. The empire and the U.S. at that point had their representatives at the \\"Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary\\" level. Sinan Kuneralp, author of \\"Ottoman Diplomatic and Consular Personnel in the United States of America, 1867‚Äì1917,\\" wrote that the empire initially apparently lacked \\"any sensible justification\\" to open a mission stateside due to the relative distance between the countries. Wasti wrote that \\"there was no real rush on the Ottoman side to send diplomatic envoys to Washington, DC\\". The first official Ottoman government visit to the U.S., lasting for six months in 1850, was that of Emin Bey, who toured shipyards there.Kuneralp, p. 100-101. Two Ottoman officials, one being Edouard Blak Bey, who sensed the rise of the United States, unsuccessfully advocated for installing a mission in the U.S. during the early 1850s. The first Ottoman honorary consulate in the U.S. opened in May 1858.Kuneralp, p. 105-106. In 1866 Ottoman foreign minister Mehmed Emin √Çli Pasha declined to start a legation to the U.S. that year, after reviewing a proposal by Ambassador to France of the Ottoman Empire Safvet Pasha. However the ministry changed its mind after the leaders there perceived the reports of the Cretan revolt (1866‚Äì1869) from the US consul W.J. Stillman and other American reports to be misleading and decided they needed to present a counter-view. The empire sent its first permanent envoy to the U.S. in 1867, creating the Ottoman Legation in Washington, DC. Since the empire itself began establishing its diplomatic missions in the 1830s and due to the about three decade gap between the respective legations being established, Kuneralp wrote that the Ottomans created their U.S. mission \\"comparatively late\\". Blak was the first envoy to Washington. Kuneralp wrote that the Washington posting was not considered important to the Ottoman government, which is why some officials refused the posting and those considered promising were turned away from it. He cited the cases of then- minister to Florence R√ºstem Bey and Osman Nizami Pasha, who declined in 1867 and 1912, respectively.Kuneralp, p. 101. \\"During the half-century that followed Blacque's appointment till 1917[...]12 heads of missions succeeded one another in Washington.\\" Nine envoys headed the legation beginning in 1877 and prior to full embassy status,Turkish Yearbook of International Relations.

Mustafa Shekib Bey, in 1904, recommended that the Ottomans appoint Levantine Armand Guys as the first commercial attach√©, arguing that commercial relations had increased.Kuneralp, p. 105. In 1906 U.S. upgraded its representatation in Constantinople to the embassy level. The most important aspect of American diplomacy in the late 19th century, down to 1914, involved protection of the hundreds of American Protestant missionaries to the Ottoman Empire.Edward Mead Earle, \\"American Missions in the Near East.\\" Foreign Affairs 7.3 (1929): 398-417. onlineRoger R. Trask, The United States Response to Turkish Nationalism and Reform, 1914-1939 (1971) pp 3-15. = Armenian issues = Abdul Hamid II disliked it when the Americans pleaded for help for Armenians. As a result, he terminated the credentials of envoy Mustafa Shekib, and chose not to upgrade the mission to embassy status. Shekib therefore was unable to present his credentials to the President. Shekib slept in the daytime, and so his staff dealt with U.S. officials. Kuneralp stated that therefore \\"Things were eased out\\". = Moro rebellion in the Philippines = In 1899, John Hay, the American Secretary of State, asked the Jewish American ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Oscar Straus to request Sultan Abdul Hamid II to write a letter to the Moro Sulu Muslims of the Sulu Sultanate in the Philippines telling them to submit to American suzerainty and American military rule (see Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War). The Sultan obliged and wrote the letter, which was sent to Sulu via Mecca; two Sulu chiefs delivered it to Sulu and it was successful since the \\"Sulu Mohammedans... refused to join the insurrectionists and had placed themselves under the control of our army, thereby recognizing American sovereignty.\\" Abdul Hamid used his position as caliph to order the Sulu Sultan not to resist and not fight the invading Americans. President McKinley did not mention the Ottoman role in the pacification of the Sulu Moros in his address to the first session of the 56th Congress in December 1899 since the agreement with the Sultan of Sulu was not submitted to the Senate until December 18. Despite Sulu's \\"pan-Islamic\\" ideology, he readily acceded to Straus' request to avoid hostilities between the West and Muslims. The Sulu sultan was persuaded by the Ottoman Sultan. John P. Finley wrote that, > \\"After due consideration of these facts, the Sultan, as Caliph caused a > message to be sent to the Mohammedans of the Philippine Islands forbidding > them to enter into any hostilities against the Americans, inasmuch as no > interference with their religion would be allowed under American rule. As > the Moros have never asked more than that, it is not surprising, that they > refused all overtures made, by Aguinaldo's agents, at the time of the > Filipino insurrection. President McKinley sent a personal letter of thanks > to Mr. Straus for the excellent work he had done, and said, its > accomplishment had saved the United States at least twenty thousand troops > in the field. If the reader will pause to consider what this means in men > and also the millions in money, he will appreciate this wonderful piece of > diplomacy, in averting a holy war.\\" The Muslim peoples obeyed the order. In 1904, the Moro Rebellion then broke out between the Americans and Moro Muslims. The US committed atrocities against Moro Muslim women and children, such as the Moro Crater Massacre. = Young Turk Revolution = The Young Turk Revolution removed Abdul Hamid II from power in 1908, and officials more favorable to the U.S. replaced him. The Ottoman Legation in Washington was designated as an embassy in 1909, and given the second class ranking; the Ottoman Empire at the time ranked its embassies by importance.ƒ∞hsanoƒülu, Ekmeleddin.

It failed with respect to the Ottoman Empire because of opposition from US ambassador Oscar Straus and to Turkish vacillation under pressure from the entrenched European powers who did not wish to see American competition. American trade remained a minor factor.Naomi W. Cohen, \\"Ambassador Straus in Turkey, 1909-1910: A Note on Dollar Diplomacy.\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review 45.4 (1959) online = World War I and the Armenian genocide = Henry Morgenthau, Sr. was the U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire during World War I until 1916. Morgenthau criticized the ruling Three Pashas for the Armenian Genocide and sought to get help for the Armenians. Jesse B. Jackson, consul in Aleppo, also assisted Armenians. Morgenthau's replacement Abram Isaac Elkus, served in 1916‚Äì1917. The Ottomans severed diplomatic relations with the United States on April 20, 1917, after the United States had declared war against Germany on April 4, 1917. The United States never declared war on the Ottoman Empire. Normal diplomatic relations were re-established with the Ottoman Empire's successor state, Turkey, in 1927.Spencer Tucker, ed.

The Ottoman Ministry of Internal Security gave him a teskireh travel permit, but the Ottoman Ministry of Foreign Affairs initially refused to recognize the consulate. The building had three stories, a wall, and a garden with mulberry trees. Leslie A. Davis became consul of Harpoot in 1914; Davis stated that this mission was \\"one of the most remote and inaccessible in the world\\". Davis observed the Armenian Genocide.

Ottoman envoy Alexandros Mavrogenis had advocated for a full consulate-general and afterwards, on the grounds of New York having more diplomatic importance to the empire than Washington, DC, asked the Ottoman government for a vice consul in New York. The consuls in New York began to squabble for power with the Washington consuls.Kuneralp, p. 106.

The genus name is from Ancient Greek gelao, \\"to laugh\\", and khelidon, \\"swallow\\". It was previously considered conspecific with the gull-billed tern. Taxonomy John Gould described Sterna macrotarsa from a specimen held at Kings College, London in 1837. Description This is a fairly large and powerful tern, similar in size and general appearance to a Sandwich tern, but the short thick gull-like bill, broad wings, long legs and robust body are distinctive. The summer adult has grey upperparts, white underparts, a black cap, strong black bill and black legs. The call is a characteristic ker-wik. It is in length and in wingspan. Body mass ranges from . In winter, the cap is lost, and there is a dark patch through the eye like a Forster's tern or a Mediterranean gull. Juvenile Australian terns have a fainter mask, but otherwise look much like winter adults. Range It breeds in Australia and New Guinea. Life history This species breeds in colonies on lakes, marshes and coasts. It nests in a ground scrape and lays two to five eggs. This is a somewhat atypical tern, in appearance like a Sterna tern, but with feeding habits more like the Chlidonias marsh terns, black tern and white-winged tern. The Australian gull-billed tern does not normally plunge dive for fish like the other white terns, and has a broader diet than most other terns. It largely feeds on insects taken in flight, and also often hunts over wet fields and even in brushy areas, to take amphibians and small mammals. It is also an opportunistic feeder, and has been observed to pick up and feed on dead dragonflies from the road.

His work was part of the art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1936 Summer Olympics. Life The family Pick was the owner of the famous Hungarian Pick Salami factory established by M√°rk Pick in 1869. The factory, owing to Italian workers, became a market leader in 1883 and it has remained the most reputed salami producer in the country ever since, especially noted for Winter Salami. Farkasr√©t Cemetery Having passed the Matura examination, he started studying law in Budapest and began to take lectures on art history. He regularly attended the lectures of the art historian and art critic Gyula Pasteiner (1846 ‚Äì1924); the philosopher, aesthete, translator and theatre critic Bern√°t Alexander (1850‚Äì1927); and literature historian Guszt√°v Heinrich (1845‚Äì1922). During this period he was more interested in athletics rather than in art. After having passed two basic exams (in German Rigorosum) in law, he continued his studies in Berlin. The German metropolis changed the young man's life. He attended the lectures of du Bois-Reymond and Heinrich W√∂lflin (1864‚Äì1945) the Swiss art historian. At the university library he read a lot by Shakespeare, Leo Tolstoy and Anton Chekhov and he had the opportunity to visit international exhibitions, which decisively directed him towards art. He decided to become a sculptor. He returned home to announce his decision to his father who would not share his enthusiasm. He was made to stay at his father's house. Two bitter years passed by, yet he promised his mother that he would not go against his father's will, and he finished his university studies. In May 1907 he obtained his degree at the faculty of law yet already in the week of the graduation ceremony he left the family home and ‚Äì and with the recommendation of a remote relative of his ‚Äì he met the sculptor Eduard Telcs (Ede Teltsch, 1872‚Äì1948). Telcs who had studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna accepted Pick as an apprentice. Pick's characteristic style developed during the two years that he spent at the atelier of Telcs and he learnt a lot from him. As he writes: ‚ÄúHe [Telcs] taught me to respect art, to despise the inferior devices meant for effect and to recognise the worthlessness of kitsch‚Äù ‚Äì and he adds ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat I learnt from him is that the artist shall be honest regarding his emotions and trustworthy when he creates a piece of art. Beside these it is indifferent what we will call conservatism or modernism or whatever movement. The question is how much an artist has got to say and to what extent he is able to express it‚Äù. https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/ORSZ_NEMG_NemzetiSzalon_1958_1960/?pg=496&layout;=s Petri moved to Belgium so that he could establish his own atelier in Brussels and so that he could introduce himself in an international milieu. In Brussels at the height of the history of Belgian sculpture, he himself influenced several artists. He made acquaintance with Jules Lagae (1862‚Äì1931) and Egide Rombeaux (1865‚Äì1942) who frequently visited him in his atelier. Later he described how his style changed in the following way: \\"Looking at the sculptures of my earlier years, it is clear that it was the form that enjoyed priority to the disadvantage of the drama and emotionality. It was only the liberation of the later years that brought the perfection and completeness of emotionality, when the form of my sculptures started to bear only a secondary meaning. I recognised that due to the sophisticated elaboration, the strength of expression weakened, and I tended to lose my capability of making the dynamics of the sculpture perceptible and the spontaneity of the message was gone, yet spontaneity is the best device to achieve effect. The esprit of a message has an increased effect when we deliver it spontaneously\\" . https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/ORSZ_NEMG_NemzetiSzalon_1958_1960/?pg=496&layout;=s [https://www.kozterkep.hu/378#vetito=204276 A Fortepan photo taken of Lajos Petri's Monument to the 2nd Regiment of the Transylvanian Hussars erected in Buda Castle He spent the following twelve years of his career in Belgium, where he was regarded as a significant sculptor famous for his portraits. His style of figurative sculpture started to evolve here. He made the following sculptures in Belgium: Runner at the starting line, Life and Dancing girl (1911) ‚Äì this latter can be considered as the most modern sculpture in its time. World War I affected his career as well, it forced him, as many of his colleagues to have a pause. Then in 1922, he participated in a group exhibition in Stockholm, which was followed by an individual exhibition in Ernst Museum in Budapest. Although Lajos Petri had already become a successful sculptor at international level by this time, he was not really accepted in his home country. During the period between 1925‚Äì1940, almost his entire time was consumed by submitting his applications to calls announced by the state. This was a bitter epoch for him as his applications, which required plenty months of work, were in most of the cases rejected by the political establishment. The year 1935 brought the recognition that he had been longing for as he received the greatest order from the Hungarian state, a monumental statue, a hussar on horseback. In Hungary, this monument is considered as one the greatest examples of statues in classical style commemorating historical events. Following this he received several orders from the state yet World War II interrupted this new, successful period of his career. During the disasters of the war one of his friends, Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, the internationally acknowledged Hungarian composer and the president of the Hungarian Academy of Science, helped him survive the unhuman era. After the war Kod√°ly, who also played a leading role of rebuilding the cultural life in Hungary, supported Petri further on. Petri's spirit was not broken, and finally after the war he began to receive many orders from the state. He also proved to be very productive in other fields, he held lectures on art: The conflict of art and the public, The role of art criticism and beauty in the new art and The real face of Michelangelo. He also started to publish his studies: From clay to marble, Depicting sport in art and About Monumentality. His reputation did not fade in Belgium, a long article was written about him in the Brussels literary magazine Le Mus√©e du Soir, and he had the pleasure to have an exhibition once more in Brussels in 1959. His entire career was introduced at a comprehensive exhibition at the Nemzeti Szalon in Budapest in 1960 and then in the same year at the Hall of Art (in Hungarian M≈±csarnok) in Budapest. Petri about the portrait: ‚ÄúThe similarity of the portrait to its model is a complex thing. The sculptor cannot create this similarity solely by observing the model in every detail. What the sculptor needs is understanding and affection, interest in the model and identifying himself/herself almost entirely to the model‚Äôs thoughts and emotions. Egocentric and condescending people, who lack these, will never create a good portrait; not even of those whom they love. This is why Michelangelo called the portrait, as such, the peak of all sorts of art. Furthermore, this is the reason why a certain connection will have developed between its creator and its model by the time the portrait is completed. Here I have to point out that there is huge confusion regarding the model‚Äôs beauty and the beauty of the sculpture. These two are messed up all the time. The sculptor can create a kitsch of a beautiful young girl; and at the same time, he can create a masterpiece of art of a model who happens to be an old woman, who is not beautiful. I am lost for words to condemn all that is only make up, cosmetician‚Äôs work, all that is taken over from fashion, diminishing women‚Äôs beauty to the level of some serial look, to the level of a fashion type. However, the greatest value is intensifying all the characteristics of a face, all that is interesting in it; all significant attributes which are to be portrayed, everything that expresses the model‚Äôs personality. Those who can merely perceive the model‚Äôs beauty, fail to perceive the very thing that only art can mediate to people‚Äôs world of facts‚Äù. https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/ORSZ_NEMG_NemzetiSzalon_1958_1960/?pg=496&layout;=s At the end of his career he returned to Szeged, his hometown situated on the riverbanks of the Tisza.

Background The cult of saints and their relics, unfamiliar to early Christianity, became widespread in Anglo-Saxon England. The worship of saints and their relics began in fourth-century Rome, when Christians begin to dig up the bones of their saints for worship; this was opposed by the priest Vigilantius, who was opposed in turn by Jerome. By the end of the 4th and 5th centuries, the cult of relics had grown to include secondary objects such as clothing. Real and fake relics were kept in churches, monasteries and royal houses, and were widely traded; the trade in relics increased after the Crusades. Even fake relics were richly decorated with gold, silver, and precious stones for display to pilgrims who considered them authentic. By the mid-16th century, the number of relics was enormous and it was nearly impossible to determine a relic's authenticity. Guibert of Nogent's early-12th-century On Saints and Their Relics () was a critique of popular religion and the alleged relics in the Abbey of Saint-M√©dard de Soissons, a Benedictine monastery which was destroyed during the French Revolution. The Reformation criticized the veneration of saints and relics, and 1543 Calvin published his Tract on Relics in response to Albert Pighius' 1542 \\"De libero hominis arbitrio et divina gratia libri X\\" (which opposed Calvin and Martin Luther). Contents Front page of the first English translation, by Stephen Wythers (published in 1561 by Rowland Hall) Calvin described relics from 12 cities in Germany, three cities in Spain, 15 cities in Italy, and 30-40 cities in France. He asserted that fake relics had been traded since Augustine's lifetime, and had increased as the world inevitably became more corrupt. Calvin proposed to abandon the veneration of relics, citing God's hiding of Moses' burial place in the Old Testament book of Deuteronomy (). According to Calvin, God hid Moses' body so the Jews would not fall into idolatry (which he equated with the veneration of relics). Calvin listed in detail the falsified Christian relics known to him, which were kept in churches and monasteries. According to him, saints had two, three or more bodies with arms and legs; extra limbs and heads also existed. Calvin did not understand where the relics of the Biblical Magi, the Bethlehem babies, the stones which killed Stephen, the Ark of the Covenant, or Aaron's two rods (instead of one) came from. Objects of worship included Jesus' robe and a towel with which he wiped himself. The relics had several copies, in different places. Others included a piece of fish which Christ ate after the resurrection, Christ's footprint on a stone, and his tears. Cults of hair and the Milk of the Virgin were widespread. The combined quantity of Mary's milk was so great that, according to Calvin, only a cow could produce that much. Other objects of Marian worship were a very large shirt, two combs, a ring, and slippers. Relics associated with the Archangel Michael were a small sword and shield with which the disembodied Michael defeated the disembodied spirit of the Devil. At the end of the treatise, Calvin warned the reader: Translations The Authentic Relics of Saint Blaise, from La Calotte The Treatise on Relics has been translated into a number of languages. Twenty editions were published between 1543 and 1622: seven in French, one in Latin, six in German, two in English and four in Dutch.Carlos M. N. Eire.

Although Reformed denominations have removed representations of saints from their churches, Lutherans permit images of saints but do not worship them. Jacques Collin de Plancy published his three- volume Critical Dictionary of Relics and Wonderworking Images (), partially based on Calvin's work, in 1821‚Äì22.Dictionnaire critique des reliques et des images miraculeuses Jacques Albin Simon Collin de Plancy T 1Dictionnaire critique des reliques et des images miraculeuses Jacques Albin Simon Collin de Plancy T 2Dictionnaire critique des reliques et des images miraculeuses Jacques Albin Simon Collin de Plancy T 3 The saints were arranged in alphabetical order, and each entry identified how many of their bodies were in different churches.

Factions of the security forces of Amhara Region, Ethiopia attempted a coup d'√©tat against the regional government, during which Amhara Region Chief Administrator Ambachew Mekonnen was killed. A bodyguard siding with the Amhara nationalist factions assassinated General Se'are Mekonnen, the Chief of the General Staff of the Ethiopian National Defense Force, as well as his aide Major General Gizae Aberra. The Prime Minister's Office accused Brigadier General Asaminew Tsige, head of the Amhara region security forces, of leading the plot. Asaminew was later shot dead after escaping.  Background  Ethiopia has historically faced ethnic conflicts, and the government established a system of ethnic federalism under the 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia, establishing the Amhara Region as a subnational region where the population is predominantly made up of the Amhara people. The traditional districts of Wolkait and Raya Azebo had been part of the provinces of Begemder and Wollo respectively, but they were joined to the Tigray Region, since they are mainly populated by Tigrayans. The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM) (renamed the Amhara Democratic Party, ADP) had been accused of \\"disciplining the Amhara people instead of representing them\\". Despite these grievances, Amhara ethnic nationalism remained a marginal force during the first two decades of the EPRDF-led order. Amhara political elites continued to place their stock in pan-Ethiopian nationalism and largely rejected ethnic self-identification in favour of a purely Ethiopian one. Accordingly, the region voted overwhelmingly for the Coalition for Unity and Democracy and United Ethiopian Democratic Forces opposition alliances in the 2005 general elections, which had run on decisively pan-Ethiopian platforms. Abiy Ahmed's rise to power encouraged the belief that the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) was in decline and motivated Amhara nationalists to push for the \\"return\\" of the \\"lost\\" regions in the Tigray Region. This was strongly resisted under the leadership of Debretsion Gebremichael. In March 2019, Amhara regional chief administrator Gedu Andargachew resigned for unstated reasons, but warned of the rising danger of \\"narrow nationalism\\" in his farewell speech. Ambachew Mekonnen replaced him.Gedu Andargachew resigns; replaced by Ambachew Mekonen To this end, he appointed retired general and former political prisoner Asaminew Tsige as head of the regional security forces. Asaminew delivered an \\"incendiary\\" speech in June at the graduation of members of the security forces, reportedly full of Amhara nationalist invective.  Events  Gen. Se'are (right, in peaked cap) with Prime Minister Abiy (second from right) in February 2019. Early in the evening of 22 June, witnesses claimed to have seen and heard explosions at the Regional Police Commission headquarters, the offices of the regional legislature and seat of the regional administration. Shortly after, observers‚Äîincluding the United States Embassy‚Äîreported gunfire in Addis Ababa. The Prime Minister's Office said that a \\"hit squad\\" reporting to Brigadier Genenal Asaminew Tsige, Chief of the Amhara Region Peace and Security Bureau, had burst into a meeting of the regional cabinet and opened fire. According to Reuters, the meeting's agenda concerned Asaminew's attempts to openly recruit ethnic militias. In a statement shortly after midnight on 23 June, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced that General Se'are Mekonnen, Chief of Staff of the Ethiopian National Defense Force, had been attacked by \\"people in his close entourage\\" who had been \\"bought by hired elements\\". The next morning, Radio Dimtsi Weyane reported that Se'are and his aide Major General Gizae Aberra had died from their wounds. The Amhara Mass Media Agency likewise reported that Amhara Region Chief Administrator Ambachew Mekonnen had been killed along with adviser Ezez Wassie. Amharra Region Attorney General Megbaru Kebede was also seriously injured and died on 24 June. Asaminew remained at large for 36 hours after the attempt. The state media confirmed that he was shot dead by police near Bahir Dar on 24 June, while several of his alleged co-conspirators have been detained. Conflicting details regarding the bodyguard who assassinated General Se'are Mekonnen were given from the government. Initial reports indicated that the suspect was arrested. However, on 24 June 2019, police said the suspect had committed suicide in order to avoid arrest.  Aftermath  Following the coup attempt, internet access was shut down nationwide. Ethiopia remained offline two days later with no official explanation. Prime Minister Abiy called for unity against the \\"forces of evil\\" and flags flew at half-mast on Monday as the government declared a national day of mourning. The United States Embassy advised people to shelter in place, and a wide range of international leaders condemned the coup attempt.

Three spells are partially preserved on the papyrus. One is a cure for headache, one probably for a skin condition, and the purpose of the third spell is uncertain. Two fragments of the papyrus survive, in the collections of the Morgan Library & Museum, New York, and the Berlin State Museums. Papyrus The Philinna Papyrus is made up of two fragments: P. Amh. 11, published by Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Surridge Hunt in 1901, and P. Berol. 7504, published by Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff in 1907. In 1942 Paul Maas identified that the two fragments were part of the same roll. The surviving piece is 10 x 8.2 cm in total, with parts of two columns surviving, written in a hand dating to the first century BC. The verso of the papyrus preserves parts of two further columns, in a cursive hand from about the first century AD. P. Amh. 11 was purchased by Grenfell and Hunt on behalf of Lord Amherst between 1897 and 1900. In 1913 it was acquired by the J.P. Morgan Library (now the Morgan Library & Museum) in New York. P. Berol. 7504 was bought at around the same time by the Berlin State Museums. Contents The Philinna Papyrus is part of a collection of spells in hexameters. Each spell has a title with the name and nationality of the author and the ailment which the charm is intended to cure. The surviving portion of the papyrus preserves three spells. The first spell is damaged, and it is not certain what it was for. The text printed in PGM2 restores the heading as [ œÄœÅŒø]œÇ Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒ∑(œÇ) [œÄŒøŒΩŒøŒΩ ] (\\"spell for a headache\\"), but Robert Daniel suggests instead that \\"Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒ∑\\" is part of the nationality of the author, and the word should be restored as ŒöŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒπŒ∑(ŒΩŒπŒ¥ŒøœÇ) (\\"of Kefalonia\\"). This damaged spell is followed by two more: one attributed to a Syrian woman for inflammation, and one by Philinna of Thessaly for headaches. =Syrian woman's spell= Lines 4-12 of the papyrus are a spell \\"œÄœÅŒøœÇ œÄŒ±ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒ±œÖŒºŒ±\\" (\\"for any inflammation\\"), attributed to a Syrian woman from Gadara. The name of the Syrian woman does not survive. Another version of the same spell is known from a papyrus from Oxyrhynchus The inflammation that the spell treats is probably a sort of skin condition, though the word Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ∫Œ±ŒªœÖŒºŒ± is also used in ancient Greek medical texts for fever. The charm is of the type known as historiola, wherein a myth is told which is analogous to the desired outcome of the spell. In the story, seven maidens put out a fire with pitchers of water. No other version of this story is known in Greek mythology, though there are parallels with an Egyptian myth about Isis and Horus, and even earlier Egyptian and Mesopotamian healing magic. =Philinna's spell= Lines 13-19 are a spell for headaches, attributed to Philinna the Thessalian. This Philinna may be the same as the Philinna from Larissa who was the mother of Philip Arrhidaeus, one of the sons of Philip II of Macedon and half-brother of Alexander the Great.

The theory assigns a certain cost to deploying defensive missiles and suggests a way to maximize their value in terms of the amount of damage they could reduce. By comparing the cost of various deployments, one can determine the relative amount of money needed to provide a defense against a certain number of ICBMs. The theory was first introduced in the late 1950s and might have been lost to history had it not been picked up during the debate on the Nike-X ABM. Nike-X called for the deployment of a heavy defensive system around major US cities with the intent of seriously blunting the effect of any Soviet strike. A number of operations researchers, notably US Air Force General Glenn Kent, used Prim‚ÄìRead to conclusively demonstrate that the cost of reducing damage back to a given level was always more than the cost of causing additional damage by building more ICBMs. The outcome of these studies suggested that any US deployment of an ABM system would result in the USSR building a small number of additional missiles to defeat it. Assuming the Soviets would come to the same conclusion, Robert McNamara became highly critical of any large-scale ABM system, and began efforts that would ultimately lead to the ABM treaty in 1972. The underlying concept became known as the cost-exchange ratio. History =Nike Zeus= The US Army began studying the anti-ballistic missile in a serious fashion in 1955. Working with Bell Labs, who had delivered the successful Nike and Nike B surface-to-air missiles (SAM), they began by considering what was essentially a direct update of the Nike concepts to the ABM mission. Bell returned a report suggesting that minor upgrades to the Hercules missile, along with much more powerful radars and computers, would do the trick. This was initially known as Nike II, but renamed Nike Zeus in 1956. Early in the Zeus effort the US Air Force attempted to derail the project by pointing out that if Zeus cost the same as an ICBM, and the Soviets were building them as quickly as Nikita Khrushchev claimed, then they could simply build a few more to \\"soak up\\" any Zeus' the Army deployed. But in fact, it seemed the ICBMs were actually cheaper than Zeus, perhaps significantly, which meant the US would lose the resulting arms race. This basic concept became known as the cost exchange ratio. President Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense Neil McElroy identified the Air Force complaints as an example of sour grapes, having lost funding for their own ABM efforts, Project Wizard, in favor of Zeus. But the math appeared to be correct, so he asked for a second opinion from the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC). They largely agreed with the Air Force's take, and then added several additional concerns of their own. By the late 1950s, several new problems became evident. One was that the newly discovered nuclear blackout effect would allow an enemy to blanket an area hundreds of miles wide with a radar-opaque layer for the cost of one warhead. This would render Zeus blind to anything above the layer; following warheads would not become visible until too close to the base to attack. Another issue was the addition of decoys to the ICBMs, which presented radar targets that looked the same as the warhead. These cleared away due to drag as they reentered the atmosphere, but once again, this occurred at too low an altitude to attack. =Nike-X= At the suggestion of ARPA, the Army responded by redesigning the system as Nike-X. Nike-X used a short-range but extremely high-speed interceptor known as Sprint that was optimized for interceptions under and combined that with an extremely high-speed radar and computer system. The plan was to wait until the warhead cleared any blackout and the decoys were slowing, allowing the radar to pick out the warhead and attack it with the Sprint. The entire engagement would last only a few seconds. The Army produced a study that considered a real deployment scenario and then estimated the number of lives it would save. They started by assuming that the Soviets would want to launch two warheads at every target, to ensure at least one would go off. In order to confuse the defense, they would add nine credible decoys to each ICBM. This would present each base with 20 radar targets in total. For the same redundancy reasons, they would launch two Sprint missiles at each one, so a total of 40 Sprints would be needed to protect every target. Given the relative costs of the Sprint and an ICBM, the Army demonstrated that the Sprint system would save a considerable number of civilian lives for less than the cost of an ICBM. =Last-move problem= When this was presented as a part of a PSAC study of the Nike-X system, one member of the group immediately noted a problem. Air Force Brigadier General Glenn Kent had been taught to always consider who had the last move in any plan, and in this case, he concluded that the Soviets had that advantage. Facing a Nike-X deployment, they could change their ICBM targets without the US having any idea what those were. For instance, one response would be to ignore the defended targets entirely, and use the missiles to attack the next cities on their target list. Since those targets would be smaller, they could be assigned one missile each. Although this would increase the number of targets that were not destroyed due to failures, the total number of targets hit would be greater. Another solution would be to ignore targets further down the list and reassign those warheads to ones further up the list, ensuring the defenses at those targets would be overwhelmed through sheer numbers. Although the targets further down the list would no longer be attacked, they had smaller populations so their value was less. In either case, the attacker could once again cause enormous damage without spending a single extra dollar on the attack. Worse, the US has no idea which strategy the Soviets picked, and therefore have no idea how to respond. The question, then, was how does one plan a defensive layout when there is no clear answer what the enemy's response will be? When Kent pointed this issue out to Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E;) Harold Brown, Brown immediately grasped the problem and recalled the Army group to explain why their analysis was essentially useless. He then tasked Kent with coming up with a way to analyze the problem that would not be dependent on knowing the Soviet attack allocations. =Prim‚ÄìRead= Kent learned that two researchers at Bell Labs had considered this exact issue in a 1957 paper. Robert Prim and Thornton Read solved the problem by developing a simple mathematical formula that maximized the damage reduction in terms of any given expenditure on the defense. Prim visited Kent at the Pentagon to explain the idea, which was extremely simple in conceptual terms. The basic idea was a reflection of the targeting priorities the Soviets would use. Against \\"soft targets\\" like cities, a single warhead will effectively destroy it, so launching additional warheads at the same target will not cause a corresponding doubling of damage inflicted. However, the missiles have a certain probability of successfully reaching the target and detonating, the probability of kill, or Pk. If the Pk is 50%, for instance, the Soviets will want to launch more than one ICBM at a target to increase the chances of destroying it. Two warheads improve this to 75%, and three to 87.5%, but in that case, if the first one does work the following two are wasted. They have to balance the desire to guarantee destruction of certain targets with the knowledge that other targets would then be skipped entirely. The Prim‚ÄìRead concept used the same basic logic but applied it to the chance of successfully destroying an enemy missile. For instance, if a city is expecting to be attacked by two warheads, then its chance of being destroyed is 75%. Assigning a single interceptor to defend that city means one of the two warheads will be shot down 50% of the time. This means the chance of not getting hit is now 50%, a 25% improvement. Critically, adding a second interceptor means a 50% of hitting either, a 75% chance of hitting both. The chance you hit the one that would go off is 50-50, so now the chance the target does not get hit is 62.5%. Thus adding the second interceptor only improves the survival rate by 12.5%. The key point here is that instead of applying the second interceptor to improve the survival rate of that target 12.5%, it might be better to instead put that interceptor over some other target that formerly had no protection, and improve its survival rate by 50%. Of course, this requires one to put a value of some sort on the targets so one can calculate if 50% of one target is worth more than 12.5% of another. Consider a real-world example in which New York is considered to have twice the \\"value\\" of Los Angeles. In this case, a naive arrangement would be to assign twice as many interceptors to New York. However, due to the Pk considerations, this does not provide twice the defensive capability, but a fractional addition. In the case of large numbers of interceptors and enemy warheads, additional missiles may provide only a tiny benefit. In contrast, assigning those missiles to Los Angeles may dramatically improve its survival if it otherwise had only a few. Improving Los Angeles' survival by 25% is likely \\"better\\" than improving New York's by 12.5%. The paper goes on to explain how to arrange the overall deployment. Each target is assigned a worth, W, and the price of the defense assigned to protect it is P. The ratio of W to P is Œª. If one were to assign a single missile to all potential targets, then the list of resulting Œª values would mirror the W values. If Œª is less than 1, that means the cost of defense is more than the worth of the target. In this case, that target's missile is much better off being assigned to another target, the one with the highest Œª. When that happens, the Œª of that target drops because more P is being spent on it. As a result, another target becomes the highest on the list of Œª. One then continues this process of reassigning missiles until the resulting list of targets that are protected have the same Œª, or as close to that as possible. Œª, in effect, represents the damage percent you are willing to accept. One can make real-world calculations by selecting the population of the urban area to be a proxy for W. In this case New York has the highest W and initial Œª, and it is naturally assigned the largest number of interceptors. One might be inclined to move a missile from Los Angeles to New York to offer higher protection, but the brilliance of Prim‚ÄìRead is that demonstrates that while doing so would improve New York's survival rate a tiny bit, it would lower Los Angeles' even more. One outcome of the Prim‚ÄìRead deployment is that it is based entirely on the number of ABMs constructed and the total worth of the targets they protect. It does not matter what the Soviet response to the deployment is; if they choose to reduce the number of missiles assigned to one target to ensure they penetrate the defenses of another, that will always increase the overall survival rate of the defenders. It is possible for the Soviets to overwhelm the entire system, but even in that case the Prim‚ÄìRead deployment will reduce whatever damage will be caused by the maximal amount possible. =Prim‚ÄìRead becomes notorious= With Prim‚ÄìRead, one can construct a mathematically maximal defense for any given expenditure. Because that defense is probabilistic, it means that it assumes some damage even when the defense is overwhelming, and at the same time it means there will be some reduction in damage even if the attack is overwhelming. The question then becomes whether or not the amount of damage reduction desired can be achieved for a reasonable total expenditure, given various estimates of the Soviet fleet. Kent began developing Prim‚ÄìRead deployments of various numbers of ABMs to determine their effectiveness against various numbers of ICBMs. The results were clear. Limited amounts of protection could be offered with small expenditures even if the Soviets built huge numbers of ICBMs; by pure chance, some of the targets would not be hit and ABMs would improve those numbers. The opposite was also true; if the US built an enormous fleet of ABMs, some enemy warheads would still hit their targets purely by chance. If one wanted to save 90% of the US population, one required huge numbers of ABMs, and the relative cost of the defense compared to the offense was about 1.7 times. In other words, if the Soviets spent $10 billion producing ICBMs in a given year, the US would have to spend $17 billion on ABMs. However, when they found the official exchange rate between the US Dollar and Ruble was a fiction, and the actual value was very different, the ratio inflated to 6-to-1. In this sort of regime, the USSR could easily afford to build enough missiles to overwhelm any defense the US could afford. Kent presented his results to Brown, who began to have serious questions about any sort of active defense. While this had no immediate effect on Nike-X planning, this was all taking place while another group was forming to consider the entire issue of the nuclear age under the direction of Frank Trinkl, part of Alain Enthoven's group at RAND. Kent was put into the group and noted that of the twenty items they had been tasked to consider, eight of those were purely defensive and he suggested grouping them together under the topic of damage limitation. Trinkl disagreed, and when Kent continued to pester him about it, Trinkl fired him from the group. Brown then tasked Kent with going ahead and considering the eight issues in his own report, and this time assigned members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to help. The report, on the topic of \\"damage limitation\\", immediately caught the eye of Robert McNamara who \\"bought it lock, stock, and barrel.\\" McNamara put his feelings on the matter succinctly, stating to Kent that \\"At 70 percent surviving, you say 70 percent surviving, General, that sounds pretty good. Do you know what our detractors will say? 'Only 60 million dead.'\\" From that point on, McNamara was against any sort of large scale Nike-X deployment, and the system was ultimately canceled. The basic concept, which became known as the cost-exchange ratio, ultimately ended any large-scale ABM deployment in the United States, and led directly to the 1972 ABM Treaty. This did not end well for Kent, who was blamed for this situation, with one detractor stating \\"There‚Äôs the man that was the genesis of the ABM Treaty, the worst of our greatest strategic disasters, the ABM Treaty of 1972.\\" References =Citations= =Bibliography=  =Further reading= * Category:Game theory Category:Missile countermeasures Category:Anti-ballistic weapons ","title":"Prim‚ÄìRead theory"},{"id":"61113342","text":"√Ånimas is a 2018 Spanish thriller film directed and written by Laura Alvea and Jose F.

He was released in 2018 and restored to his prior rank and pension. Asaminew is part of Amhara people, which is Ethiopia's second largest ethnic group. He has been known for his hard line ethnic nationalism and was particularly popular among a segment of young Ethiopians. After his release from prison and appointment to a government post, he has advocated for more autonomy for Amhara and went as far as calling members of his ethnic groups to arm themselves and join local militias. Though the International Crisis Group said that his activities helped the rise of the National Movement of Amhara (NaMA), which emerged as a challenger to the Amhara Democratic Party, NaMA was established before the coming of Gen. Asaminew to the government power. Asaminew was accused of being behind an alleged attempted coup in the Amhara Region in 2019. The President of Amhara region Ambachew Mekonnen was killed during the alleged attempt. In a related event, the Chief of Staff of the Ethiopian National Defense Force, Gen. Se'are Mekonnen, and his aide, Maj. Gen. Gizae Aberra, were assassinated by a bodyguard, the office of Ethiopian Prime Minister Dr. Abiy Ahmed said. Se'are and Ambachew were close allies of the prime minister.

The group disconformably overlies the Dartry Limestone of the Tyrone Group. Stratigraphy The group comprises a series of shales and sandstones which in stratigraphic order (youngest/uppermost at top) are: =Lackagh Sandstone Formation= The formation is 60-90m thick in the Connaught Coalfield but only about 36m thick on Cuilcagh Mountain where it forms the prominent cliff-edged summit surface as also at BelmoreMarble Arch Caves Global Geopark; Exploring the landscape of Fermanagh and Cavan (map), 2015 GSNI . It is unfossiliferous. =Gowlaun Shale Formation= Some 50-60m thickness of shales and mudstones of Arnsbergian age constitute this formation. =Briscloonagh Sandstone Formation= About 53m of Pendleian age sandstones with interlayered siltstones and some mudstone make up this formation. =Dergvone Shale Formation= Mostly dark coloured iron-rich shales of Pendleian age, it reaches up to 128m thick. From its top downwards, it is divided into the Lacoon Sandstone, Killooman Shale, Tonlegee Shale, Tullyclevaun Shale, Black Mountain Shales and Gubaveeny Shale members. =Carraun Shale Formation= From 50m to over 160m thick, this Brigantian age formation is largely shale but contains thin limestones, siltstones and sandstones, some of which are given their own names as members e.g. the Doagh Limestone and Tawnyunshinagh Limestone members. =Bellavally Formation= This Asbian to Brigantian age formation varies from 45m to 80m thick and consists largely of sandstones and shales with lesser amounts of siltstone and limestone. From its top downwards, it is divided into the Corry, Sheena Shale, Glenkeel, Doobally Sandstone, Drummangarvagh, Lugasnaghta, Sraduffy, Larkfield and Tullyskeherny members. =Glenade Sandstone Formation= Referred to as the Yoredale Sandstone in the late nineteenth century, this Asbian age sequence varies from 4m thick in County Leitrim to as much as 350m in the north of its range. In places it sits directly on the Dartry Limestone where the Meenymore Formation rocks are missing due to the locally high relief of the underlying erosive surface. Animal fossils are almost wholly absent from this formation though fragments of Calamites and leaf remains are more common. =Meenymore Formation= The lowermost and hence oldest division of the Group is of Asbian age. It comprises mudstones and limestones and delta sandstones, two of which are mapped as separate ‚Äòmembers‚Äô; the Glen and Quarry Sandstone, the former only being seen west of the Glen Syncline. The thickness of the formation varies from 18m at Doagh to 100m to the east of Cuilcagh Mountain. A depositional hiatus separates this formation from the underlying Dartry Limestone.

Blak's motive for the request stemmed from his marriage. The empire did not reciprocate until 1867.

Son Armado is based in Austin, Texas. History When describing Son Jarocho, founder Alexis Herrera said, ‚ÄúHistorically speaking, Son Jarocho was something that was a celebration, a way for people to get together to share themselves and take a break from the day-to-day life, and to sing about it in these poetic ways; dance it out, share food, share drink, and experience through this art form.\\" The Fandango involves things like dancing, poetry, and music. This all takes place on a tarima. A tarima, is a wooden dance platform. The Son Jarocho is folkloric music that comes from Spanish, Arabic and African cultures. These cultures came together in Veracruz for first time, and was later made into a movement by founder Carolina Sarmiento and its members. To play the Son Jarocho, one must use a jarana, which is a small eight-string instrument. The Son Jarocho was originally only performed by men, but that was changed by the Son Armado as part of their feminist movement.

It tells the story of a singing competition between two mountains, Cithaeron and Helicon, which was apparently won by Mount Cithaeron. Preservation The poem is preserved on a second- century BC piece of papyrus, P.Berol. 13284. The papyrus was discovered by Otto Rubensohn at Hermopolis in 1906. Poem The contest poem is about a singing contest between Cithaeron and Helicon; conflict between these two mountains is known from other sources, but Corinna's poem is the only known mention of a singing contest between the two. In Corinna's poem, Cithaeron apparently wins the contest; in other versions of the story, Helicon is the victor. The surviving part of the poem begins with one of the singers concluding his song, which tells the myth of how the titan Rhea hid her youngest child, Zeus, from Cronus. The poem continues with the gods voting on the winner of the contest, and awarding the victory to Cithaeron.Corinna, 654 PMG ll.18-27 Next, Helicon throws a down boulder in his anger, which breaks into ten thousand pieces. Corinna's use of the story of Rhea and the birth of Zeus in the poem is apparently influenced by Hesiod's account of the same myth in Theogony. There are several verbal echoes of Hesiod in Corinna's version of the story, though she also adds her own innovations - such as the inclusion of the Curetes, which are not mentioned in the Theogony. Performance Corinna's poems were probably mostly written for choral performance in connection with local festivals. The contest poem may have been written for performance at the Daedala, a festival in honour of Hera at Plataea, which was held in part at the summit of Mount Cithaeron.

It contains various resources of Books, EBooks, manuscripts and rare books in various disciplines and languages. The library holds about 250,000 works.  History  = Prior to 2006 = The library was first established in 1963 by Sayyid Abbas Al- Hussayni Al-Kashani, and it was holding about 5,000 books in its shelves, most of them were damaged or stolen during the 1991 uprisings in Iraq against Saddam Hussein's regime, and it was neglected since then up to the reopening in 2006. = Post 2006 = In 2006 it was reopened after 3 years of being closed after the Iraq war in 2003, the reopening was heavily supported by Sayyid Ali al-Husseini al-Sistani. The new library included new divisions that were not existed in the old library, many specialized divisions and units were developed to cope with the requirements of the new era after the Iraq war and to handle the scientific requirements by the students of the Iraqi Universities and researchers.  Collecting the manuscripts  Nearly five thousand written copies classified as precious, rare and of heritage were collected in the Library within the period of 2009 to 2014, and this operation was done in three stages: = The first stage = The first stage: to collect the manuscripts without a specific kind of scripts. The goal was to safeguard and collect what can be collected from the scattered, damaged, stolen treasures, or those smuggled out of the country because of successive wars, instability or economic and cultural reasons. The last factor explains the status of ignorance of their value, importance and scarcity leading to their damage, another example is what happened during the uprising of Sha'ban in 1411 / 1991, when the soldiers and members of the Baathists made tea in the courtyard of Al-Abbas Holy Shrine on the fire made out from burnt rare books and manuscripts, therefore this experience made the library put in the priorities of work to collect what can be collected and therefore experts were hired for this work. = The second stage = The second stage: The treatment, maintenance and safeguard of the manuscript within the proper conditions. For this purpose the house of manuscripts sent to known European countries in this area its competent affiliates in order to make their training and get recognized specialization diplomas. The House also bought a private \\"hospital\\" to address and treat manuscripts according to the latest known technologies, and its affiliates are today the leading specialists in this regard in Iraq, which allow them to maintain a number of known libraries in different provinces of Iraq. = The third stage = The last stage included the picturization, classification, the indexing of the manuscript and the historical, scientific and author identification to configure it, to facilitate its delivery and to make it accessible to the hands of researchers and investigators.

Belfrage's obituary in The Independent stated that he ‚Äòoften fired clients he did not like and yet the lowest he would sink in condemnation was that such and such didn't know how to live‚Äô. Belfrage, however, was ‚Äòan expert at living‚Äô. He had a particular love of the turf which he playfully enjoyed with John Hurt and Christopher Reeve. Despite his success, he was described as caring not one jot for money, unless it afforded a day at the races. Life Julian Rochfort Belfrage was born in London on 19 February 1934, the son of Bruce Belfrage, who read the nine o'clock news during World War II, and the actress Joan Henley. He started his career as the understudy to Peter Barkworth in a London play, Roar Like a Dove. Despite the theatrical background of his family it was not entirely a success, and Belfrage was later persuaded to use his talents to become a theatrical agent with Kenneth Carten. In the 1960s he joined another London agency, Terence Plunkett-Green, before going into partnership with Michael Whitehall trading as Leading Artists. When his partnership with Whitehall ended, he set up Julian Belfrage Associates. Belfrage persuaded Daniel Day- Lewis to play Christy Brown in My Left Foot, a part for which Day-Lewis won an Oscar. Belfrage described the moment as the happiest day of his life. During the course of his career, his clients included Dame Judi Dench, Sir John Hurt, Daniel Day-Lewis, David Warner, Sir Ian Holm and Colin Blakely. An ardent racegoer, Belfrage owned several racehorses. He died in London on 28 December 1994 and a number of races were subsequently named in his honour; the Julian Belfrage Memorial Chase was held at Towcester Racecourse on 19 March 1997. Belfrage married firstly, Gilly Pratt, by whom he had two sons, one of whom, Crispian Belfrage, became a Hollywood actor. He married secondly, Victoria Van Moyland, who inherited Belfrage's agency.

The common phonological, morphological and syntactical features of the two languages have been studied for more than a century. Both languages are part of the Balkan sprachbund but there are certain elements shared only by Albanian and Romanian. Aside from Latin, and from shared Greek, Slavic and Turkish elements, other characteristics and words are attributed to the Paleo-Balkan linguistic base: Illyrian, Thracian, Dacian and/or Thraco-Illyrian, Daco-Thracian. Despite the similarities, genetically they are only distantly related Indo-European languages.  Background  = Romanian = The four Balkan Romance languages in the early-20th-century Albanian dialects in Southern Europe Romanian is a Romance language spoken by about 25 million people primarily in Southeastern Europe. Its principal variant, Daco-Romanian, is the official language of Romania and Moldova. A second variant, Macedo-Romanian (or Aromanian), is spoken by about 350,000 people in Albania, southwestern Bulgaria, northern Greece and North Macedonia. The third variant, Megleno-Romanian, exists in the Meglen region in southeastern North Macedonia and northern Greece. The fourth variant, Istro- Romanian, is spoken in eight settlements in Istria (in Croatia). The four variants developed from a common ancestor, known as Proto-Romanian. The venue of the formation of Proto-Romanian is debated. Some scholars propose that the Roman province of Dacia Trajana (which existed to the north of the Lower Danube from 106 AD to 271) was included in the Romanians' homeland. Other scholars say that Proto-Romanian descended from the Vulgar Latin spoken in the south-Danubian Roman provinces and the Romanians' ancestors started to settle in most regions of Romania only in the 11th century. = Albanian = Forming a separate branch of the Indo-European language family, Albanian is spoken by about 6.5 million people in Albania and the nearby regions in Montenegro, Kosovo, Serbia, North Macedonia and Greece. Albanian has two main dialects, Gheg and Tosk, with the former spoken to the north of the river Shkumbin and the latter to the south of the river. Two varieties of the Tosk dialect, Arvanitika in Greece and Arb√´resh in southern Italy, preserved archaic elements of the language. Gheg and Tosk which are primarily distinguished by phonological differences are mutually intelligible. According to concurring scholarly theories, the Albanian is regarded as the direct descendant of ancient Illyrian or Thracian languages, or of the hypothetical Daco-Mysian language. Tosk/Gheg differentiation leading to regular correspondences,: \\"In Tosk /a/ before a nasal has become a central vowel (shwa), and intervocalic /n/ has become /r/. These two sound changes have affected only the pre-Slav stratum of the Albanian lexicon, that is the native words and loanwords from Greek and Latin.\\" affect native words, Latin loans, and Classical Greek loans, but not Slavic loans, leading researchers to the conclusion that the dialectal split preceded the Slavic migration to the Balkans.: \\"The dialectal split into Gheg and Tosk happened sometime after the region become Christianized in the fourth century AD; Christian Latin loanwords show Tosk rhotacism, such as Tosk murgu \\"monk\\" (Geg mungu) from Lat. monachus.\\" According to the view of Demiraj, at the time of the Tosk/Gheg split, Albanian populations were roughly in their present location, while Eric Hamp agrees \\"it must be relatively old, that is, dating back into the post-Roman first millennium\\", and speculates Tosk/Gheg isoglosses could reflect \\"a spread of the speech area, after the settlement of the Albanians in roughly their present location, so that the speech area straddled the Jireƒçek Line\\".: \\"The isogloss is clear in all dialects I have studied, which embrace nearly all types possible. It must be relatively old, that is, dating back into the post-Roman first millennium. As a guess, it seems possible that this isogloss reflects a spread of the speech area, after the settlement of the Albanians in roughly their present location, so that the speech area straddled the Jireƒçek Line.\\" = Balkan linguistic area = Albanian and Romanian, along with Bulgarian and Macedonian, are the core members of the Balkan linguistic areaan area of linguistic convergence affecting six to eight languages in the Balkan Peninsula (in Southeastern Europe). Linguists also list the Torlakian dialect of Serbo-Croatian and Greek among the members of the same linguistic area. The membership of the Balkan dialects of Romani (or Gypsy) and of Turkish is debated, although they share some characteristics with the other idioms. Scholars agree that only common characteristics shared by more than two languages in the group can be regarded as true Balkan features. Albanian and Romanian share most Balkan features, but they also have common features which do not characterize other Balkan languages. The existence of an unrounded central voweleither a mid central vowel (…ô) or a close central unrounded vowel (…®)is the principal common phonological feature of most Balkan languages, although these vowels are not present in Greek and standard Macedonian. The loss or limited usage of infinitives characterizes all Balkan languages, but Albanian developed a new type after losing the inherited form. The postponed article is also a well- known Balkanism, missing only from Greek: for instance, Albanian n√´n√´ and n√´na (\\"mother\\" and \\"the mother\\"), Bulgarian selo and seloto (\\"village\\" and \\"the village\\"), and Romanian om and omul (\\"man\\" and \\"the man\\"). Most Balkan languages use the auxiliary verb \\"want\\" when creating verbs in future tense and merged the dative and genitive cases in nominal declension.  Literature  Johann Erich Thunmann who published Theodore Kavalliotis' Greek-Arumanian- Albanian dictionary in 1774 was the first scholar to notice that Albanian and Romanian share a number of elements of their vocabulary. Gustav Meyer listed most common lexical elements of the two languages in his Etymologisches W√∂rterbuch der albanesischen Sprache (\\"Etymological Dictionary of the Albanian Language\\") in 1891. The Romanian philologist Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu who studied the pre-Latin elements of the Romanian language came to the conclusion (in 1901) that the origin of the shared vocabulary was most probably to be searched in the earliest phase of the two peoples' ethnogenesis. Thereafter, a number of Romanian linguistsAlexandru Philippide, Alexandru Rosetti, Grigore Br√¢ncu»ô and othersstudied the similarities of Albanian and Romanian, especially in connection with their research on the origin of the Romanians. The Albanian linguist Eqrem √áabej was the first to emphasize the similar phonological and morphological elements of the two languages. He also drew attention to the similarities between Albanian and Romanian proverbs and the parallel development of the formation of sentences.  Common features  = Phonology = The Tosk dialect of Albanian, spoken in Southern Albania, in particular is held to have experienced developments parallel to early Romanian. These notably include the centralization of /a/ before nasals, rhotacism of intervocalic /n/ (regular in Tosk, more limited in Romanian : see LAMINA > lamura). Some words of the shared Albanian-Romanian lexicon, such as vatra/vatrƒÉ, in Romanian clearly agree with the Tosk form and not the Gheg (northern) Albanian form. The proposed interaction between Tosk and Romanian is held to have been the last stage of the crucial Albanian-Romanian period of convergence. Since these effects are marginal if present at all upon Slavic loans, they likely occurred before contact with Slavs. Other features dated to the breakup of Romance languages that are shared between Albanian and Romanian include the merger of long /eÀê/ and short /i/, but not long /oÀê/ and short /u/ (most Romance languages either merged both or neither), and the replacement of /k/ in clusters /ks/ and /kt/ with a labial (p in Romanian, f in Albanian: see luctare > Albanian luftoj, Romanian lupta; Latin coxa > Albanin kofsh√´, Romanian coapsƒÉ). In the latter case, variation in Albanian outcomes has been explained as being the effect of loans entering Albanian at different times. = Morphology = When comparing the morphological elements of the four core languages of the Balkan linguistic area, scholars have concluded that Albanian and Romanian share most common features. Albanian and Romanian use postponed articles with proper names, while this feature is absent from Bulgarian and Macedonian. = Lexicon = There are several hundred words in Romanian that are cognate only with Albanian cognates (see Eastern Romance substratum), though by lower estimates there are 70‚Äì90 possible substrate words with Albanian cognates, and 29 terms are probably loanwords from Albanian. Similarities between Romanian and Albanian are not limited to their common Balkan features and the assumed substrate words: the two languages share calques and proverbs, and display analogous phonetic changes.  Proposed explanations  215x215px 215x215px Hamp refers to an \\"Albanian substratum\\" in Romanian, arguing its early formation was shaped by language shift from Albanian to Latin, while Fine argues that the critical area of Albanian- Romanian contact was the valley of the river Great Morava in what is now eastern Serbia, before the Slavic invasions. Other scholars have differentiated different groups of Latin loans in Albanian representing different stages and historical scenarios. Albanian/Latin convergence began during the first century CE, with the dating of Latin loans used to differentiate between Early Proto-Albanian (just before initial imperial Latin contact) and Late Proto-Albanian (at the time of contact with Proto-Romance). There has also been a distinction between later convergence with different Romance languages in Albanian. Romanian scholars Vatasescu and Mihaescu, using lexical analysis of the Albanian language, have concluded that Albanian was also heavily influenced by an extinct Romance language that was distinct from both Romanian and Dalmatian. Because the Latin words common to only Romanian and Albanian are significantly less than those that are common to only Albanian and Western Romance, Mihaescu argues that the Albanian language evolved in a region with much greater contact to Western Romance regions than to Romanian-speaking regions, and located this region in present-day Albania, Kosovo and Western Macedonia, spanning east to Bitola and Pristina.  Scale  Some scholars, such as Schuhardt and Meyer, have taken it to pronounce either Romanian to be \\"Latinized Albanian\\" or Albanian to be half-Romance. Later 20th century scholarship in Albania and Romania, represented especially by the works of Eqrem √áabej and Haralambie Mihaescu, has reconsidered many of the proposed Romance etyma in Albanian to in fact be cases of formations internal to Albanian that were based on older Romance loans, and voiced reservations that the extent of convergence was being exaggerated. Nevertheless, the latter group of scholars continue to view the Albanian- Romanian relationship as a pressing question in the histories of both languages.

She served as a member of the Weimar National Assembly (\\"pre- parliament\\"), convened to agree a post-imperial German constitution, during 1919/1920. Biography Maria Schmitz was born into a Catholic family in Aachen. Carl Hubert Matthias Schmitz (1842‚Äì1921), her father, was an architect and an Aachen city councillor. Her mother, born Pauline Bohlen (1848‚Äì1917), was the eldest of four siblings, of whom two had become nuns. As a small girl she was privately educated at home. Then she attended an all-girls' secondary school, also finding time to study abroad in order to improve her foreign languages. Girls' schools did not prepare pupils for university admission at this time, but she did successfully complete a first level course at a teacher's training academy, so that by the time she was seventeen she was employed as a teacher at the \\"H√∂heren M√§dchenschule Caspari\\" (girls' secondary school) in Trier, where she remained till 1900. It was also in 1892 that she joined the Union of German Catholic women teachers (\\"Verein katholischer deutscher Lehrerinnen\\" / VkdL). By this time she had also, as a teenager, spent a \\"youth year\\" as a member of a Franciscan convent. Between 1900 and 1902 she attended the \\"Senior Women Teacher's Course\\" (\\"Oberlehrerinnenkurse\\") provided by the University of M√ºnster. The focus of her studies was on the teaching of History, German, Philosophy and Theology. Although this two year course was not a standard \\"university degree course\\", her participation in it supports the assertion appearing in at least one source that Maria Schmitz was one of the first women in German who was able to study at a university. In 1903 she was offered and rejected a post as a private tutor to the daughter of Archduchess Marie Valerie of Austria, thereby turning down the opportunity to educate a grand-daughter of the Emperor of Austria. Instead she took a senior teaching post at the Ursuline School in her native Aachen. Quite soon she moved on to St Leonards, another all-girls' secondary school in Aachen. She was also actively engaged in teacher training. during this period. From the start of the century Maria Schmitz placed herself in the front-line of the struggle for access to a comprehensive range of properly designed and respected study options for women. However, unlike many of the more high- profile women's rights activists of the time, her objective was not that girls' education should as far as possible be the same as boys' education. Schmitz's vision was for education provision appropriate to what were then seen as a conventional female lifestyles, appropriate in terms both of professional and family duties. This approach, which was clearly at the heart of her own pedagogical activism, was in many ways not too far removed from the distilled wisdom, on the subject of education, to be found in many of the more progressive parts of the church. Schmitz was actively involved with the Catholic Women's Movement, alongside Hedwig Dransfeld (1871‚Äì1925). On 17 May 1907 she founded the Hildegardis-Verein, recognised today as Germany's oldest organisation dedicated to promoting women's education. She was a member of its executive board between 1907 and 1962, and its chair or deputy chair between 1907 and 1921. In 1908 Schmitz became a deputy chair of the VkdL. She moved to Berlin in order to work full-time for the association in 1912. In 1916 she took over the chairmanship from Pauline Herber (1852-1921). She remained in position till 1953, apart from an enforced hiatus under the Hitler government between 1937 and 1945, during which the VkdL was suppressed. After 1953 she stayed on as an honorary chairwoman. Between 1912 and 1922 Schmitz also served as content controller (\\"Schriftleiterin\\") of the VkdL journal, \\"Kath. Frauenbildung\\" (loosely, \\"Catholic women's education\\"). She also engaged actively with various other Catholic organisations. Military defeat in 1918 was followed by a period of political and social upheaval sometimes accompanied by violence. Schmitz was elected as a Catholic Centre Party member to the Weimar National Assembly, convened to agree a post-imperial German constitution. She was one of only 37 women elected to the 421 seat assembly. With others, she campaigned strongly in favour of full voting rights for women. She was also a member of the National Conference on Schools in June 1920. Schmitz worked collaboratively (for the most part) with other (female) parliamentarians, such as Agnes Neuhaus, Christine Teusch, Helene Weber and Marie Zettler on the schools legislation. It was on the initiative of Maria Schmitz that the \\"Deutsches Institut f√ºr wissenschaftliche P√§dagogik\\" (\\"Catholic Teaching Institute\\") was set up at M√ºnster. Ten years later she was instrumental in securing a teaching position at the institute for the remarkable Edith Stein. In the first part of 1945 Maria Schmitz joined the millions fleeing Berlin towards the west. She ended up in Recklinghausen (north of Essen and Dortmund) where she reorganised what briefly became a new (West) German national headquarters for the VkdL. (The 1937 ban had been lifted following the collapse of the Hitler r√©gime.) Still under her chairmanship, the VkdL moved its national head office again, to a more permanent location in Essen, in 1949. Under Schmitz the VkdL developed from being an advocacy body to becoming an educational institution in its own right, creating programmes for training, education and schools policy. A particular priority for Schmitz involved the establishment of pedagogic academies as places for teacher training and, more specifically, backing the academic education of women. The consistency and wisdom with which Maria Schmitz backed the preservation of Christian values in education earned her great respect from pupils and colleagues alike. However, her continuing advocacy of \\"celibacy\\" for women teachers, even if it met with the approval of the church establishment, was already beginning to look rather out of date by the end of the 1950s. (For an earlier generation, across and beyond Catholic Europe, it would have been completely normal for women teachers to abandon teaching and concentrate on their duties as wives and mothers in the event of marriage.)

The main line was between and ; there was a branch from Fratton to East Southsea; and a line between and . The last-named section was isolated from the others, being on the Isle of Wight. The first section of line opened in 1847 and the last in 1885; the Southsea branch closed in 1914 but all of the other routes have since been electrified and remain open. History The London and South Western Railway (LSWR) first served the town of Portsmouth by means of a line connecting to its main line at , which opened in 1841. The Brighton and Chichester Railway (B&CR;) had completed their line from Shoreham to in 1846. In August 1845, the B&CR; was authorised to build an extension to Portsmouth. Shortly after opening to Chichester, the B&CR; was absorbed by the newly- created London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR). The projected B&CR; line was built by the LBSCR, opening from Chichester to on 15 March 1847, and from Havant to Portsmouth on 14 June 1847. On 26 July 1848, two connections from that line to , forming a triangle between Farlington Junction, Cosham and Portcreek Junction, were opened for LBSCR goods traffic; and on 1 September 1848, the LSWR opened a line from on its Gosport line to Cosham and began running goods trains through to Portsmouth via the western side of the triangle; LSWR passenger services between Cosham and Portsmouth began on 1 October 1848. The Portsmouth line was extended to , opening on 2 October 1876; Portsmouth station was renamed Portsmouth Town on the same day. In 1877, the LSWR and LBSCR were jointly authorised to build a new pier at Ryde, a railway line along that pier, and a connection from that line to the Isle of Wight Railway (IWR) at . The line was opened between St John's Road and on 5 April 1880, including a tunnel to the south of Ryde Esplanade; and to on 12 July 1880. Although the line was jointly owned by the LSWR and LBSCR, its services were provided by the IWR from the outset and from 1 October 1888 also by the Ryde and Newport Railway (which later became part of the Isle of Wight Central Railway), until those companies were absorbed by the Southern Railway (SR). The third component was the Southsea Railway, which ran from a junction with the main line at to ; this was authorised in 1880 and opened on 1 July 1885. Like the main line, this branch was worked jointly by the LSWR and LBSCR. A large motive power depot was built at Fratton, in the angle between the main line and the Southsea branch. Construction commenced in 1889, and its main feature was a roundhouse-type locomotive shed containing a turntable of diameter. The LSWR and the LBSCR shared the turntable and most of the facilities, but each railway had its own offices, coal stages and stalls radiating from the turntable. Between thirty and forty locomotives from each company were based at this depot, being used on long-distance services to London, as well as shorter-distance services to places such as (LBSCR) and (LSWR). Among a total of 293 members of staff in 1926, there were 101 pairs of drivers and firemen. A breakdown crane was provided, and by nationalisation this was capable of lifting . LBSCR locomotives based at Fratton had the letter \\"F\\" painted on the platform angle just behind the front buffer beam; the LSWR did not use shed codes, and nor did the SR, but under British Railways, the code 71D was allotted in 1950, and by 1956 this was altered to 70F. In January 1947, 43 locomotives were allocated to Fratton, of which 23 were ex-LSWR, 18 were ex-LBSCR, and two were SR U class 2-6-0s. The Southsea branch closed on 8 August 1914 as a temporary wartime expedient, but it was not reopened, and the track was removed in 1924. At the 1923 Grouping, the LSWR and LBSCR amalgamated with each other and with some other railways to create the Southern Railway, which thus became owners of the P&RJR.; Apart from the Southsea branch, all of the lines of the P&RJR; passed to British Railways at the start of 1948, and are still open. =Electrification= On 27 June 1935 the SR announced plans to electrify the route between Hampton Court Junction (near ) and Portsmouth via ; this included the portion of the former P&RJR; between Portcreek Junction and Portsmouth Harbour station. Work commenced in October 1935, and was sufficiently complete to allow an electric train to reach Portsmouth & Southsea on 8 March 1937, and Portsmouth Harbour on 11 April. The full electric service began on 4 July 1937. The section on the Isle of Wight was electrified in early 1967 as part of the scheme to electrify (using the 630 V DC third-rail system) the only railway line on the island not to have been closed ‚Äì that between Ryde Pier Head and , electric services commencing on 20 March 1967. In 1988, British Rail obtained approval to electrify the route between Portsmouth and Southampton and between Fareham and Eastleigh, which included the remaining unelectrified portion of the former P&RJR; between Portcreek Junction and Cosham and also the northern side of the Cosham triangle; the lines were energised on 14 March 1990 with services commencing in 14 May 1990. Extent At its peak, the P&RJR; had of route on the mainland, including the Southsea branch and two short branches in Portsmouth: one from Blackfriars Junction to the terminal (low level) portion of Portsmouth Town station; and one from just outside Portsmouth Harbour station to Watering Island Jetty.

It is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Description and interpretation  This drawing is a double-sided preparatory sketch for the painting of the Libyan Sibyl as part Sistine Chapel commission. The recto (or front) side of this chalk drawing displays a young male figure twisting over his left-hand shoulder while holding up an imaginary object. We now know (based on the final painting in the Sistine Chapel) that the sibyl holds open a large book. Even though the finished figure is in fact a woman, the sketch shows emphasis on the model's muscles and definition of his male physique. The verso side of this study depicts a seated figure in the center of the image, along with a detailed sketch of a knee and small figure in the top right corner. The central figure depicts anatomical renderings more closely related to feminine features, rather than masculine. Michelangelo was known for using male models for his depictions of women, with muscles and forms more masculine in nature as is evident in the recto side of this drawing.  Influence  Early Christian imagery steered away from nakedness until the mid-thirteenth century and became more widely used throughout the Renaissance. Michelangelo's depictions of nudes were prevalent in his religious commissions with a focus on physical power of the male figure.

Twenty-five years on, Dick Randall is engaged to Rose Bunting, but her parents, Colonel and Mrs Bunting, have been told the story of his origins and insist Dick must find at least one parent, or the wedding is off.

The call is usually ascribed to one Margery (sometimes Margaret) Starre (). She is generally described as an \\"old woman\\", although she has also been characterised as a beldam. The Peasants' Revolt in Cambridge On 15 June 1381, revolt broke out in Cambridgeshire, led by a gang from Suffolk and local men who had been involved in the London riots who had returned to spread unrest. The University of Cambridge was staffed by priests and enjoyed special royal privileges; this attracted the ire of the lay inhabitants of the town. The Mayor of Cambridge led the rebellion and one of the first major incidents was against the university. The university's library and archives were burnt in the centre of the town. The historian Barrie Dobson has noted the popularity of burning charters, \\"records and writings in the house of justice\\" and other legal records during the Peasants' Revolt. Corpus Christi College‚Äîwhich had close links with the unpopular John of Gaunt‚Äî was sacked on 15 June and a number of chests containing the college's muniments were removed. The university was particularly unpopular in Cambridge as, on the one hand, it took a heavy-handed role in the town's policing, but on the other, its scholars received benefit of clergy which effectively exempted them from lay courts. On 16 June, the mob destroyed university documents on a bonfire in Market Square. In what Juliet Barker has described as one of the more picaresque moments of the revolt, Starre scattered the ashes to the four winds, crying out \\"away with the learning of clerks, away with it!\\" as she did so, dancing triumphantly with the mob. Starre may not have been averse to literacy itself, suggests the Chaucerian Susanne Sara Thomas, as much as the oppressive bonds charters represented, and they may have been more generally a symbol of \\"the establishment\\"; The historian Edmund King has suggested that the episode illustrates that Starre and her cohorts did not realise \\"how little learning is to be found in most official university documents\\", while the medievalist Alastair Dunn has questioned whether the tale of Margery Starre's may, in fact, be the stuff of legend. In any case, although part of what Barker has called a \\"summer of blood\\" and \\"a general riot of destruction and death\\", Starre destroyed property but did not kill anyone, although a later attempt was made on the life of the University bedel. Starre achieved, said Dan Jones, a \\"brief notoriety\\" even at a time of general notoriety, and that her \\"spirit of jubilant vandalism\\" pervaded the entire city. In medieval culture Thomas has suggested that Starre was something of a precursor to Geoffrey Chaucer's character The Wife of Bath of The Canterbury Tales (c. 1387‚Äì1400), who rips pages out of her husband's book and then later makes him burn it, while Dorothy Colmer has suggested that she reflects the \\"political dissatisfactions of the age\\" as represented by Starre in 1381. Thomas Shippey has drawn comparisons with Shakespeare's followers of Jack Cade, in Henry VI, Part 3, and their exhortation to \\"kill all the lawyers\\".

She was married to Edward Despard, ringleader of the Despard Plot.  Biography  Little is known about Catherine Despard's life prior to her marriage to Edward Despard. She was from the Caribbean, likely the Bay of Honduras, where her husband was stationed as Superintendent of British Honduras. In biographies, Catherine Despard has been described as being from an unknown background, reported as either Jamaican or Spanish Creole. It is unknown in what year the Despards married, but upon their return to England in 1790, they were married and had a son, James. In 1798, Despard's husband was arrested and imprisoned at Coldbath Fields Prison on suspicion of treason. Catherine Despard publicly campaigned against the conditions her husband was subjected to in prison, attracting the support of the proponent of prison reform Francis Burdett. She embarked on a letter-writing campaign writing to the Duke of Portland, Sir Richard Ford, William Wickham, and various London newspapers detailing the poor conditions in the prison. As a consequence, a debate on habeas corpus for Edward Despard was carried out in the House of Commons, with Catherine Despard's letters presented by MP John Courtenay. There was an inquiry into the condition at the prison and Catherine Despard was a witness. Despite these efforts, he remained in prison for three years. In 1802, following his subsequent arrest for the Despard plot, Despard visited her husband in prison where she was suspected of bringing in contraband and seditious materials to him and the other arrested rebels. She helped to compose the speech Edward Despard gave at the gallows, when he was executed on 21 February 1803.  In popular culture  She is portrayed by Kerri McLean in the fifth series of Poldark.

It is thought that the TheravƒÅda tradition has its origins in this school. Its sutras were written mainly in Pali; and the Pali canon of Buddhism largely borrowed from this school. The TƒÅmra≈õƒÅ·π≠ƒ´ya is also known as the Southern transmission or Mahaviharavasin tradition. This contrasts with Sarvastivada or the 'Northern transmission', which was mostly written in Sanskrit and translated into Chinese and Tibetic languages. The Tamrashatiya tradition developed into Theravada Buddhism and spread into Myanmar, Thailand, and other parts of Southeast Asia. Etymology Several etymologies are given for the name of this school. TƒÅmra is a Sanskrit term referring to the color of red copper, describing the color of the monks' robes. Based on the standard Chinese translation of the term, it has also been suggested that \\"copper\\" refers to copper plates on which the Tripitaka was written. TƒÅmrapar·πái was also an old name for Sri Lanka, and the origin of the Greek equivalent Taprobana, possibly referring to the monks who established Buddhism here.Ëµ§Ê≤ºÊô∫ÂñÑ„ÄéÂç∞Â∫¶‰ΩõÊïôÂõ∫ÊúâÂêçË©ûËæ≠ÂÖ∏„Äè1967, 679È†Å; Renou, L'Inde classique, 1947„Äé„Ç§„É≥„ÉâÂ≠¶Â§ß‰∫ãÂÖ∏„Äè1981, 466; B.

White was an American politician who served as Mayor of Lawrence, Massachusetts. First stint White was the Republican nominee for Mayor in 1908. He defeated Democrat Michael F. Collins and Socialist L. B. Talbot with 62% of the vote. His eligibility for the office was questioned as White pled guilty to accepting a gift from a milk dealer while serving a milk inspector and chapter 210, section 7 of the revised statutes forbid someone who was accepted a bribe while in office from holding any public office again. White claimed that this statute did not apply to him because he was not a public officer when he was convicted. In March 1909, Edward F. Joyce, who had been removed from his position of dog officer by White, officially challenged the legality of White to serve as Mayor. White was reelected in 1909 over Democrat Dr. John T. Cahill and Socialist Joseph Donovan. On May 18, 1910, White, his private secretary Matthew Degrey Ripon, Chief Engineer (head of the Fire Department) James A. Hamilton, former aldermen Matthew Burns and Xavier Legendre and six businessmen were indicted for bribery, conspiracy to bribe, and larceny. White was alleged to have conspired to bribe the aldermen in December 1909 to remove Hamilton from office. On July 13, White was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison and fined $1,000. White continued to serve as Mayor while in jail until his resignation was accepted by the board of aldermen on July 25. On December 27, 1911, Governor Eugene Foss pardoned White on the unanimous recommendation of the Massachusetts Governor's Council on the grounds that the sentence he had received was excessive and justice had been served. Second stint In 1919, White was elected to a two-year term as Mayor by a plurality of 2,877. He was defeated for reelection by Daniel W. Mahoney, 11,365 votes to 7,939. In 1927, he ran for Alderman and Commissioner of Public Safety, but lost to incumbent Peter Carr. Third stint In 1931, White defeated Robert S. Maloney 16,218 votes to 11,597 to return to the Mayor's office. In April 1933, White refused to authorize the sale of beer in Lawrence until the city was on better financial grounds and able to borrow money. This caused the city's social clubs to threaten a recall unless he began issuing licenses. In that year's primary election, White faced eleven challengers. He finished third behind first time candidate Walter A. Griffin and Alderman Robert F. Hancock with 2,905 votes to Griffin's 6,678 and Hancock's 4,630. White died on November 28, 1938 at Burke Memorial Hospital in Lawrence at the age of 70.

Background  Birthcertificate of Carl Joseph Friedrichs Carl Joseph was born in the town and head of the district seat Cochem in Germany as a son of the Tithe-Collector Peter Friedrichs (1799‚Äì1849) and his wife Maria Margaretha born Schubert (1799‚Äì1844). On March 31, 1844 his mother died after a Doctor had carried out a Bloodletting procedure for medical purposes. After his father came home from working on the fields getting the bad news he suffered an Apopletic fit and was then half-page paralyzed. Friedrichs was given to custody in the household of his grand-aunt there he finished his schooltime and started an apprenticeship as a Printer. In 1848, during the hightime of German revolutions of 1848‚Äì49, Friedrichs decided to change the educational printery and moved to Wittlich to continue his apprenticeship. After his father died in 1849 and after and argue with his apprentice's employer in 1850 he left Germany with the intend to emigrate to the United States.  Career  Upon his arrival in Castle Garden in Manhattan in New York City he started immediately his first job as a printer at the New York Post. Then he worked in Buffalo, in Cincinnati for the Republican, in Indianapolis for the Indiana Volksblatt and for Henry Boernsteins Anzeiger des Westens in St. Louis. Having enough money saved over the years, he decided to travel with friends by horses through the U.S. states Kansas, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico and Colorado. In May 1861, inspired by the California Gold Rush, Friedrichs and his friends started in Colorado Mining for gold following several month a Motherlode, but at the end the gold Quartz wasn't substantial enough to be exploited. In August 1864 after rumors had been spread around from Emmigrants coming from the Canadian border through the Lake Superior reporting about significant gold findings up in the north, Friedrichs moved from Denver through Wyoming to Bannack. On this way he meet again his three friends Alexander Campbell, Thaddeus Judson and John Sch√∂nemannJohn Schoenemann (8. Februar 1830 - 30. Oktober 1900) in PAST AND PRESENT OF THE CITY OF SPRINGFIELD AND SANGAMON COUNTY ILLINOIS by Joseph Wallace , and they continued to move on together towards Virginia City. In March 1865 the group left Virginia City to ride to Helena then they crossed the Missouri and lately they arrived at the Confederate Gulch in Diamond City. What happened next is well explained in Dan Cushmans book, ‚Ä≥Montana - The Gold Frontier‚Ä≥ published in 1973. When Friedrichs started to work out his claim during spring time in 1866 in Diamond City, he employed 40 labourer in 3 shifts around the clock. 34 of them received $6 per hour and the other 6 between $8 and $10 per hour. But the most difficulties he observed when they started to excavate the Gold was, as he wrote it on May 22, 1866 to his friend and owner of the Merchants National Bank of Helena, Louis Henry Hershfield (1836‚Äì1910),Lewis Hershfield: Early Jewish Pioneer Merchant & Banker of Helena, Montana In: jmaw.org, retrieved July 10, 2019 that there was over three feet of frost in the ground.Merchants National Bank records, 18 handwritten letters of Charles Friedrichs, years 1866‚Äì1868 During the following summer Friedrichs send Hershfield every time accompanying letters given in hands of his messenger bringing the packages with Gold dust to the Merchants National Bank.

Since Friedrichs fear about these Road Agents increased more and more and his reduced physical condition brought him more problems, he decided to leave Diamond City. \\"I send you by Mr. Cays two packages, contents not known. I may not be over before Monday. I think I will sell the safe here. Two Paulies wish to get it. If I do not sell it, I have to stay until Monday. I cannot get a team before that time.

Friedrichs moved than from Leavenworth to St. Louis by train, while the gold was safely escorted and delivered to the United States Essay Office in New York. His gold coined in average $16,85, Campells $16,79 and McGregors, another prospector who had his gold all sifted and well cleaned $17,05 per ounce. Upon his arrival in New York Friedrichs received his certificate from the assay office and bought for all the amount United States 6% Bonds in the bank of Isett, Kerr & Co. in No. 4 Wall Street. Friedrichs took than the next ship to Europe where he visited his brother Johann Friedrichs (1833‚Äì1895) in Verviers in Belgium. After he had been warned about difficulties with his bank Isett, Kerr & Co., Friedrichs made in July 1867 a quick trip back to New York to get his bonds back. The banker were surprised about his visit, but Mr. Kerr gave him 20 minutes later - after Friedrichs experienced an alp and started swetting - not his already otherwise used, but other new bonds. In 1869 when this bank had been closed to due bankruptcy, The New York Times titled:  Family  Carl Joseph Friedrichs was married two times. First he married on September 26, 1867 Betty Hirsch (1850‚Äì1927) the youngest daughter of a rich Jewish family from Cochem. They had together four common kids. Alphons was born October 10, 1868 in Meiningen and became later a doctor and a government medical officer of health. Theodor was born April 2, 1870 in Meiningen moved later to London and was trained as a sculptor. Margot the first daughter was born June 15, 1871 also in Meiningen. The second daughter Elsa was born March 4, 1874 in Wollishofen (Z√ºrich) but she died shortly after her 5th birthday on March 23, 1879, after suffering from pneumonia.

They were designed for export market. Copies were later produced in China and in Spain.  Design  The Models 1904 and 1907 were similar to the Gewehr 1898. They featured a longer cocking piece. Only the rifles made for Paraguay kept the Lange Visier sight of the German rifle. While most of the rifles were fitted only with a short bayonet lug that required a bayonet with a muzzle ring, rifles ordered by Paraguay and Ecuador had another lug to fit the Mauser Model 1895 bayonet. The Siamese model was heavier and slightly longer.  Variants  = Brazilian carbine version = The Brazilian military police ordered a carbine variant, with a bent bold handle. A bayonet lug was fitted under the barrel band, similarly to the Mauser Model 1893. = Paraguayan and Chinese carbines = These carbines generally featured turned down bolt handle, even if some Chinese carbines had a straight one. The stock ended under the muzzle. The carbines also had a tangent leaf rear sight while the front sight was directly mounted on the nose cap. No bayonet could be used. = Chinese variants = China tested the Model 1904 from 1907. The rifle was known as Model 1904/1907 while the carbine was known as Model 1907. Most of the rifles were originally produced by Mauser and DWM with a special 6.8√ó57mm cartridge. The production of the Model 1907 soon started in Guangdong arsenal with DWM help. The 1911 revolution slowed the purchase of weapons and in 1914, thousand of 6.8mm Model 1907 rifles stored in Germany were chambered to the standard 7.92√ó57mm Mauser and pressed into service of the German Empire. Originally produced as the Guang Xu Type 33 during the Imperial rule, the newly formed Republic of China chose it as the standard rifle of the Chinese army as the Type 1 rifle, intended to replace the Hanyang 88. In 1915, the Chinese also decided to switch to 7.92 cartridge and the rifle was renamed Type 4 or 7.9mm Type 1. More than 200,000 were produced until 1935. The last factory producing them was the Gongxian arsenal, where the guns were nicknamed Gong 98. While they have been replaced in most front-line units at the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Type 4 rifles were kept in regular use with some units. They were still used by the Red Guards in the 1960s. = Mauser/Oviedo Model 1927 = The Spanish Fabrica Nacional de Armas, in Oviedo, produced a derivative of the Mauser 1907 for Paraguay. Three variants were produced: a long rifle (Fusil Modelo 1927), a short rifle (Mosqueton Modelo 1927) and a carbine (Carabina Modelo 1927). The bolt stop was extended to block the clips during the loading of the magazine, thus enabling the use of different models of clip. They had a tangent leaf sight while the upper hand guard of the rifle and short rifle was slightly extended. The short rifle did not featured a pistol grip and the carbine had a stock extended to the muzzle. The bolt handle was straight for the rifle and bent for the carbine, whereas the short rifle can be found with both types of bolt handles.

The centre focused on offering an interdisciplinary MA degree in Medieval Studies that drew on the skills of scholars in a range of departments whose teaching tended to be separated by institutional barriers. It had an important role in building up Leeds's capacity to deliver postgraduate education.A. J. Taylor, 'History at Leeds 1877‚Äì1974: The Evolution of a Discipline', Northern History, 10 (1975), 141-64 (p. 163), .

However, it lacked any dedicated premises for teaching or students and relied for its budget on petitioning individual departments for funds.'Building a real centre: 1978-2003', 50 Years of Medieval Studies at Leeds (2017). The foundation of the Graduate Centre for Medieval Studies took place alongside a wave of new activities among Leeds medievalists, most prominently the foundation of the International Medieval Bibliography (IMB) by Peter Sawyer, also in 1967. Related endeavours were the founding of the journal Northern History in 1966; the refounding of the medieval-studies-orientated journal Leeds Studies in English (1967) and associated book series Leeds Texts and Monographs (1966); hosting the first colloquium of the Soci√©t√© Internationale pour l‚Äô√©tude du Th√©√¢tre M√©di√©val (1974); and, in 1975, co-ordinating the staging of 42 pageants from the York Mystery Plays on the Leeds University campus.'Mystery Plays at Leeds', 50 Years of Medieval Studies at Leeds (2017).'Students, staff and activities: 2003-2011', 50 Years of Medieval Studies at Leeds (2017). = The CMS, IMI, and IMC (1978-2003) = In 1977, the Centre's first female director, Lynn Muir, was appointed (1977‚Äì82).'Lynette Muir' (2007).

Subsequent directors included Joyce Hill.Roberta Frank, 'An Appreciation of Joyce Hill', Leeds Studies in English, n.s. 37 (2006), 1-8 (p. 5). In 1996, the first appointment was made to the Centre itself, when Mary Swan was made its Director of Studies. She oversaw, in 1999, the introduction of a Ph.D. programme run by the Centre, and in 2000 the shifting of the Le Patourel Room to the University's Parkinson Building, where, as of 2019, it remains.

Alongside similar UK centres at Nottingham, Reading and York, the CMS's cross- departmental and interdisciplinary teaching was credited with breathing new life into the study of the Middle Ages.

Under the aegis of the IMI's then director Simon Forde (1988‚Äì95), in collaboration with the Centre for Medieval Studies, the Institute launched the annual Leeds International Medieval Congress, which swiftly became Europe's pre-eminent medieval studies conference.'Beginnings of the IMC', 50 Years of Medieval Studies at Leeds (2017).Simon Forde, 'IMC Memories', 50 Years of Medieval Studies at Leeds (14 June 2018).'People of the IMC', 50 Years of Medieval Studies at Leeds (2017). = The IMS (2003-) = In 2003, major restructuring took place, and the Centre for Medieval Studies and the International Medieval Institute merged to create the Institute for Medieval Studies, an independent unit within Leeds University's Faculty of Arts. These changes took place under the Institute's new director, Richard Morris (2003-2010). The institute now had a fairly large staff of its own, comprising the Director, lecturers (Mary Swan and Bill Flynn), the editorial team of the International Medieval Bibliography (led since 1996 by Alan V. Murray), and the organising staff of the International Medieval Congress (led since the 1990s by the Congress Director Axel M√ºller). However, it also counted among its members medievalists employed by schools across the University, as well as associate fellows from the Royal Armouries Museum and elsewhere in the wider Yorkshire medievalist community. During 2010-12, however, the Institute was moved into one of the Schools of the Faculty of Arts, the School of History, under the acting directorship of Graham Loud. The restructure was consolidated by the creation in the School of a new Chair in Medieval Studies, whose first appointee, Julia Barrow, took up both the chair and the directorship of the Institute in 2012.'Institute for Medieval Studies Newsletter', Bulletin of International Medieval Research, 17-18 (2012), 105-112 (p. 112). She was succeeded as director in 2016 by Emilia Jamroziak,'Minor Medieval News January 2017', Medieval Histories: News about the Middle Ages (4 January 2017). who was succeeded in turn in 2019 by Alaric Hall.'New Director of the Institute for Medieval Studies appointed' (8 August 2019). In 2013, the Leeds University Union Medieval Society was founded by Rose Sawyer to promote student-orientated activities.'Moving forward: 2011 to now', 50 Years of Medieval Studies at Leeds (2017).'LUU Medieval Society 2018-19: A Year in Review', Institute for Medieval Studies News (12 June 2018).

Between 1975 and 1981 the Institute also published three volumes in a series entitled Leeds Medieval Studies (): * The Drama of Medieval Europe: Proceedings of the Colloquium Held at the University of Leeds 10-13 September 1974, ed. by Peter Meredith, Leeds Medieval Studies, 1 (Leeds: University of Leeds, Graduate Centre for Medieval Studies, 1975). * The Tristan Legend: Texts from Northern and Eastern Europe in Modern English Translation, ed. by Joyce Hill, Leeds Medieval Studies, 2 (Leeds: University of Leeds, Graduate Centre for Medieval Studies, 1977). * The Passion de Semur, ed. by Peter Durbin and Lynette R.

It was written at Sens before 1034 and is hostile towards the Capetian dynasty that had taken the throne of West Francia in 987.R√©gis Rech, \\"Historia Francorum Senonensis\\", in Graeme Dunphy and Cristian Bratu (eds.), Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle (Brill, online 2016), accessed 21 June 2019. It was a popular and widely used text, and its anti-Capetian view is largely responsible for the questions raised by many later authors concerning the dynasty's legitimacy.Fraser McNair, \\"A Post-Carolingian Voice of Dissent: The Historia Francorum Senonensis\\", Journal of Medieval Latin 28 (2018): 15‚Äì47. The Historia is found in a single manuscript, now in the Vatican Library, BAV, regin. lat. 753A. This manuscript was probably copied in England in the twelfth century. Although it is the only full copy of the work on its own, much of the text of the Historia can be extracted from other works that borrowed liberally from it. At the Abbey of Fleury it was a source for the continuation of Aimon's Gesta Francorum and for the Historia Ecclesiastica of Hugh of Fleury. It was also mined by William of Jumi√®ges for his Gesta Normannorum ducum, by Orderic Vitalis for his Historia Ecclesiastica and by the anonymous author of the Chronicon Sancti Petri Vivi. The Historia has much in common with other historical works from Sens from the same era, such as the Chronicon Sancti Petri Vivi and the Chronicon of Odorannus. All may have made use of a lost set of annals from Sens, the Annales Senonenses, for the years up to 956. The anonymous author of the Historia may also have consulted the now lost Gesta Remensium episcoporum (Deeds of the Bishops of Reims).Auguste Molinier, \\"1373. Historia Francorum Senonensis\\", in Les Sources de l'histoire de France ‚Äì Des origines aux guerres d'Italie (1494), II. √âpoque f√©odale, les Cap√©tiens jusqu'en 1180 (Paris: A. Picard et fils, 1902), pp. 90‚Äì91. Ferdinand Lot has written on the historical value of the Historia Francorum Senonensis,Ferdinand Lot, Les derniers Carolingiens: Lothaire, Louis V, Charles de Lorraine (954‚Äì991) (Paris: √âmile Bouillon, 1891), app. vii, pp. 338‚Äì45. but the chronicle is most useful to historians for the light it sheds on a minority political view. In the view of the Historia, following the death of Louis V in 987 the legitimate monarch was his uncle, Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine. The election of Hugh Capet was thus a rebellion against Charles.Renate Blumenfeld-Kosinski, \\"Rewriting History in the Chanson de Hugues Capet\\", Olifant 15.1 (1990): 36: rebellavit contra Karolum Hugo dux Francorum (\\"Hugh, the duke of the Franks, rebelled against Charles\\"). Joachim Ehlers argues that the anti-Capetian bias of the work is not the result of pro-Carolingian legitimism but is connected the dispute between the archdiocese of Sens and the archdiocese of Reims over their roles in the coronation of the West Frankish kings. The Historia provides clear evidence of a political conception of the state as distinct from the dynasty or person of the monarch.Joachim Ehlers, \\"Die historia francorum senonensis und der Aufstieg des Hauses Capet\\", Journal of Medieval History 4.1 (1978): 1‚Äì25.

Following the annulment of the March 2019 Istanbul mayoral election, Yerlikaya served as the acting Mayor of Istanbul until a new successor was elected in a re-run in June 2019. Prior to becoming Governor of Istanbul, Yerlikaya previously served as the Governor of ≈ûƒ±rnak from 2007 to 2010, as the Governor of Aƒürƒ± from 2010 to 2012, as the Governor of Tekirdaƒü from 2012 to 2015 and as the Governor of Gaziantep from 2015 to 2018. Early life and career Yerlikaya graduated from Istanbul University Faculty of Political Science in 1989, with a degree in Public Administration. He began work at the Ministry of the Interior as a candidate to become a Kaymakam (a district governor) in 1990. He served as the Kaymakam for the districts of Felahiye, Erzin, Derabucak, Hilvan and Sarƒ±kaya during his early bureaucratic career. Yerlikaya also served as a legal advisor to the Interior Ministry and Chief of Staff at the Ministry of Health. He was also an executive board member of the Turkish Heavy Industry and Service Sector Public Employers' Union (T√úHƒ∞S). Governorships On 30 November 2007, Yerlikaya was made Governor of ≈ûƒ±rnak. Serving until 13 May 2010, he was appointed as the Governor of Aƒürƒ± on the same day, serving until 3 August 2012. On 3 August 2012, he was appointed Governor of Tekirdaƒü until 19 February 2015, on which day he became Governor of Gaziantep. He served until 26 October 2018, upon which he became Governor of Istanbul, which is his current role. =Acting Mayor of Istanbul= Turkey held routine local elections on 31 March 2019. During the mayoral vote in Istanbul, the opposition Nation Alliance candidate Ekrem ƒ∞mamoƒülu won a surprise victory, edging past government-backed People's Alliance candidate Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m by a narrow 0.2% margin. The government subsequently appealed to the Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey (YSK) for a recount. After several complaints and recounts, ƒ∞mamoƒülu was eventually sworn in as Mayor on 18 April 2019. The YSK, however, accepted a complaint by the People's Alliance for an annulment of the elections on 6 May, thus removing ƒ∞mamoƒülu from his office as Mayor and scheduling fresh elections for 23 June 2019. As customary when a political position is in doubt, the Ministry of the Interior appointed the city's incumbent governor, namely Yerlikaya, as acting Mayor of Istanbul until the vacancy could be filled by the re-run vote. Yerlikaya, as acting mayor, was criticised for taking decisions that were viewed by the opposition as beyond the remit of a placeholder. He was also criticised for supposedly turning a blind eye to pro-Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m posters and campaigns being conducted by municipal workers, who are required to remain neutral. ƒ∞mamoƒülu won the re-run with a substantially increased majority, thereby taking over from Yerlikaya. Controversies =Comments about ISIL= While serving as Governor of Gaziantep, Yerlikaya made a series of gaffes during statements about captured militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). On one occasion, he referred to an ISIL militant on trial in a formal manner, using the formal suffix 'bey' after his name (which he also repeated incorrectly). His comments were criticised for supposedly showing ISIL militants respect. Yerlikaya responded by claiming that he had been misunderstood and that the suspected militant was innocent until proven guilty in court. On another occasion, he was criticised for commenting on an ISIL suicide bomber in an apparently supportive manner after the bomber had allegedly surrendered to the police. He again rejected criticism, saying instead that his supportive words had been directed to the police operation. Personal life Yerlikaya is married and has four children.

Since 2010 Nottinghamshire Police have started three operations to study historic child abuse in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire, England. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse will look into any institutional failures to protect children in council care. History In 2010, police began to receive allegations of historic sexual abuse in Nottinghamshire children's homes. One of the first reports was from Melanie Shaw who claimed that she had been subjected to sexual abuse at Beechwood children's home in Nottingham. Shaw claimed that she had been raped and physically and sexually abused. She also claimed that a member of staff had threatened to kill her and that he told her that he had already murdered two children and buried them in the grounds of Beechwood. No charges have been brought against the people identified by Shaw. A statement from the police reads: \\"Unfortunately, it was determined that the evidential test was not passed and, as such, no prosecutions brought. Our enquiries have also not identified any unaccounted-for people at Beechwood Children‚Äôs Home. Searches were carried out at Beechwood in February 2012\\". Shaw is not the only complainant. Over 80 other people have made allegations of abuse and nearly half of them claim that they were abused at Beechwood. There have been some prosecutions. In 2016, a residential social worker was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment after being found guilty of 17 offences at Beechwood, which took place between 1981 and 1985. In 2017, a former residential worker at Beechwood was found guilty of two charges of indecent assault on a child and two charges of indecency with a child. These offences were committed in the late 1970s. On 31 July 2019, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse published its report into historical abuse in Nottinghamshire. It concluded that there was widespread sexual abuse of children during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and that Nottingham City Council, Nottinghamshire County Council, and Nottinghamshire Police had failed the victims.https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/damning-sex-abuse- report-says-3150518 See also * Beechwood children's home * Amberdale children's home * Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse References External links * The ten Nottinghamshire children's homes where staff have now been convicted of sexual abuse ‚Äì Nottingham Post * These are the 22 children's homes being investigated by Nottinghamshire Police over abuse allegations ‚Äì Nottingham Post * IICSA in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire: The background to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse ‚Äì Nottingham Post Category:Child sexual abuse in England Category:Crime in Nottinghamshire ","title":"Nottinghamshire sex abuse allegations"},{"id":"61116252","text":"Jesse Lipscombe (born 1980) is a Canadian actor.

In the book, Zaretsky examines Boswell's attempts to grapple with \\"the great questions dealing with the sense and ends of life, brought into being by the Enlightenment.\\" Overview Boswell's Enlightenment focuses on Boswell's Grand Tour of the European continent, when he introduced himself to a number of eminent thinkers and political figures, including Samuel Johnson, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, David Hume, Pasquale Paoli, John Wilkes, and Voltaire. Zaretsky contends that despite the ridiculous figure Boswell was sometimes regarded as, his irrepressible curiosity and desire to ingratiate himself with the leading figures of the day made him a representative figure of the Enlightenment. Zaretsky writes: > Though he sought out and surrounded himself with men and women who were > larger than life, Boswell was like us, but only more so. In his great swings > of exuberance and enervation, his moments of great insight and great > weakness, Boswell not only embodied the enduring doubts and hopes that mark > the modern age, but also expressed them with an intellectual honesty and > spare artistry no less enduring. Reception Boswell's Enlightenment received mostly positive reviews. It was reviewed by major publications in both the United Kingdom and the United States. Andrew O'Hagan praised Boswell's Enlightenment in New York Review of Books: \\"Zaretsky helpfully and correctly refuses to see the Enlightenment as having been simply one thing. But for Boswell it was always a movement, or movements, to supplant the certainty of systems with the vagaries of selfhood.... It turns out that Zaretsky's book is a primer for the kind of rationale that makes someone like Boswell, because it shows the force of individual personality on the action of a period. From the best writers of his day Boswell lifted ways of being more thoroughly himself.\\" O'Hagan went on to describe the importance of Boswell as described in Zaretsky's book: > Boswell is a man of his time, and one is content to follow his intrepid > journey out, sponsored by Zaretsky, to see just exactly how his intellectual > experience formed the person we came to love‚Äîopen, self-promoting, self- > hating and funny. Boswell changed the game, adding to the art of living on > the page. Previous writers have their natures (Pepys does, Defoe does, > Montaigne does and so do the Evangelists), but only with Boswell do we begin > to observe a new, modern talent for self-adaptation. In Zaretsky's book we > see the effect of one great mind upon another, again and again, and thus we > see the evolution of Boswell's dazzling prose style. Stuart Kelly also offered a laudatory review in The Scotsman: \\"This feels like the first volume of a bigger work. It is about becoming Boswell, not being Boswell, and Zaretsky expertly highlights the points where Boswell examines himself on who he might be or not be. It is an overture more than an opera. But he did eventually decide, and that decision is important, even if he never managed to make his beliefs and his actions ethically aligned.\\" Steve Donoghue, writing in The Christian Science Monitor, was skeptical about Zaretsky's argument that Boswell was an important Enlightenment figure. \\"In reality, Boswell's Tour was a thoroughly and typically ramshackle affair that even Zaretsky's spryly readable account can't entirely salvage from coffee house lounging, wine bar sousing, near-constant chambermaid-deflowering ... his behavior during these Grand Tour years was of the same cloth. Casting him as any kind of avatar of the Enlightenment is, to put it mildly, a bit of a stretch.\\" Kirkus Reviews offered high praise for the book: \\"This wonderful rendering of Boswell digs deep into his probing, enquiring life and the fast friends he made at every turn.\\" Publishers Weekly also gave a positive review, but the reviewer regretted that the book did not cover Boswell's whole life: > Boswell‚Äôs earnest search for answers to life‚Äôs bewildering puzzles continues > to fascinate. Zaretsky brilliantly, sometimes movingly, adds to that > fascination. It‚Äôs frustrating, however, that he leaves his protagonist in > mid-life, before Boswell takes up his classic Life of Samuel Johnson. Also, > though Zaretsky opens the book with a short, lively critique of > Enlightenment scholarship, he doesn‚Äôt indicate how, if at all, his portrait > of Boswell alters our present knowledge of the era. So convincing are > Zaretsky‚Äôs observations, so sure his touch, that one wishes for more‚Äîa > longer, fuller study of his subject. Fritz Lanham in the Houston Chronicle concluded that \\"Boswell remains an attractive figure because he wrestled so passionately with doubts and grand questions of life that continue to occupy us, young and old. Boswell‚Äôs Enlightenment is a readable, smart, accessible introduction to a self-absorbed but likable young man who reminds us the Age of Enlightenment was also the Age of Exuberance. James Campbell, writing The Guardian, gave perhaps the most negative review of major publications that considered the book: \\"Boswell offers the perfect specimen for an old-and-new experiment of the kind that Zaretsky performs: a man at home in the salons of the age of Enlightenment, but one who was scarcely an enlightened thinker.... Though only 288 pages long, Boswell‚Äôs Enlightenment has the feeling of being padded out. Zaretsky‚Äôs academic background obliges him to insert references to colleagues in the field, as if to give scholarly backing to assertions verging on the obvious.... [R]eaders might ask themselves why they are not reading Boswell‚Äôs journal instead.\\" See also * Boswell: Citizen of the World, Man of Letters References Sources   Category:2015 non-fiction books Category:English-language books Category:Books of literary criticism Category:Books about James Boswell Category:Belknap Press books ","title":"Boswell's Enlightenment"},{"id":"61116424","text":" ","title":"Oxyfluorfen"},{"id":"61116427","text":"Thom Kaumeyer (born March 17, 1967) is a former American football defensive back.

Originally the main gate from which the Emperor entered the complex, the gate is on the road to the north, towards Salona, the then capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia and Diocletian's birthplace. History During the late antiquity, the gate was known as the Porta septemtrionalis (\\"the northern gate\\") and Diocletian (‚Ä†316) probably entered his palace through this gate after his abdication from the imperial throne on 1 May 305.https://www.putovnica.net/odredista/hrvatska/split/sto-posjetiti- znamenitosti-u-splitu/zlatna-vrata-u-splitu In the Middle Ages, the gate was known by the name \\"Roman Gate\\" (Porta Romae).Prijatelj, Kruno, Spomenici Splita i okolice, str. 32.

Above the church of St Martin, a pre-Romanesque bell tower was erected (later demolished in the 19th century). It was similar in style to the church bell tower of Our Lady of Zvonik above the Iron Gate, which still exists. During the early Middle Ages, the gates were besieged so that a smaller passage to the north side of the city was eastern to the east, and the expansion of the medieval town to the west was opened by the Door of Picture, located west of the northwestern tower of the palace, which has since been the main entrance to the city on the north side. During the Renaissance, the gate was given its present name, and this name was first mentioned in 1553 in the itinerary of the Venetian trade unions Died and Giustiniana.Prijatelj, Kruno, Spomenici Splita i okolice, str. 33. In around 1630, the Venetian governor Alvise Zorzi gave the foundations of eleven Roman towers on the north and east side of the Diocletian's palace wall, among them octagonal towers that once defended the Golden Gate. The stone material from the ruined towers was transported to Venice on boats, to be used in the construction of Santa Maria della Salute.Baras, Frane, Prohujalo pod Marjanom, str. 42.-43. The Golden Gate was only re-opened in 1857,Prijatelj, Kruno, Spomenici Splita i okolice, str. 33. after the demolished houses that had built up against the north wall of the palace and the ground in front of the cleansed centuries-old earth embankments. Despite the cleansing, today around 2 meters the door and wall of the palace are below the ground level. The most recent reconstruction was carried out in the first years of the new millennium by metropolis, with the gate covered in a Building wrap from 2012 until 2015. Today (2020) the building is open to the public. Description The Porta septemtrionalis was the main gate of Diocletian's palace, located in the middle of the northern wall. It sits on Cardo maximus within the palace and runs to the Porta Aenea. Today they are 4.50 m high and their original height was about 6.50 m, since at present the northern wall with the door is still partially covered with earthenware that accumulated for centuries.Prijatelj, Kruno, Spomenici Splita i okolice, str. 33. The lower opening is 4.17 x 4.36 meters, over it there is a lintel (architrave) of nine romoid stone blocks of height 0.91 m, and above it is decorated a rasteret arch of 19 stone blocks with a height of 3.02 m.≈†u≈°njar, Bogdan, Villa cara Dioklecijana u Splitu, str. 71.-72.

Above the outer and inner part of the door were the guard passages that were connected by the passages on the side. Above the outer part of the Golden Gate, in a narrow guard passage, was founded in the 6th century the church of St Martin's. The door was defended by two octagonal towers since lost. The surface of each octagonal tower on the ground floor was about 60m, the inner diameter 8.53m, and the side 3.41 m. They were facing the main wall of the palace and the citizens were without a wall. The entrance led through the passages in the palace wall, and the floor could not be reached directly from the ground floor, as the ground floor and the first floor were the crosswalk.≈†u≈°njar, Bogdan, Villa cara Dioklecijana u Splitu, str. 56.-57.

In 2013, she was one of the chief advisors of her father who was prime minister at the time.  Family and education  Her father is Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan and her mother is Emine Erdoƒüan. She has three siblings: Ahmet Burak, Necmettin Bilal and Esra. In March 2016, she became engaged to Sel√ßuk Bayraktar, and married him on 14 May 2016. She graduated from Araklƒ± ƒ∞mam Hatip High School in Trabzon. After not getting her desired grade in the university entrance exams in 2002, she continued her education in the United States. With a scholarship from a businessman, she received a bachelor's degree in sociology and politics from Indiana University. After completing her education in 2005, she completed her master's degree in economics at the London School of Economics.  Career  In 2010, she became a partner at Doruk Izgara Food Trade Limited Company. Her brother Bilal Erdoƒüan was reported to be among the company's partners.  Politics  S√ºmeyye Erdoƒüan (second from right) with her parents during a visit to Greece, October 2010 In 2010, she started to work as a consultant in the Justice and Development Party (AKP), responsible for monitoring foreign relations and their reflections on the world press. Due to this position, she has been a part of many international trips. She was a counselor to her father during four years, a role she decided not to carry on in October 2014. During the Gezi Park protests in 2013, she was involved in meetings between the government and various artists. Her participation in the meetings was questioned and moved to the agenda of the TBMM for further discussion.  Controversies  It was claimed that a website which published her photographs while she was staying in the USA was closed down. An unnamed official from the Hugehost company said that after a phone call from Ankara they were left disturbed and could not provide service anymore. S√ºmeyye Bayraktar, who was among the audience of Gen√ß Osman at the Ankara State Theater, left the hall during the play saying that the movements carried out in accordance with the scenario were intended to insult her. As a result of the investigation, it was concluded that the actors did not have any negative behavior and the usual scenario was played out on stage. In the period following the December 17 corruption scandal, voice recordings of S√ºmeyye Bayraktar, who was setting the agenda for instructing AKP trolls on Twitter to tweet in favor of them on social media, were published. Again, based on the sound recordings released during this period, it was revealed that together with her brother Bilal Erdoƒüan, she transferred money from their homes to different places on their father's instructions and met with Mustafa Latif Topba≈ü about the villas built in the archaeological site in Urla and pursued business. It was claimed that S√ºmeyye Bayraktar had reached an agreement with a company to remove news published on the Internet about her private life in the past. OdaTV later reported that they had been contacted by a company, who claimed to be in charge of taking care of \\"S√ºmeyye Erdoƒüan's reputation on online services\\" and asked them to delete an article that they had published about her two years ago.

It is part of the Okanogan Range, which is a sub-range of the North Cascades. The mountain is situated northwest of Mazama, on the boundary line of the Pasayten Wilderness, on land managed by Okanogan National Forest. The peak has the distinction of having the highest road in Washington, as well as the highest fire lookout. Although the narrow one-lane white-knuckle road reaches the summit of the mountain, the Forest Service gated it to vehicles, which necessitates walking the final few hundred yards. Additionally, the Pacific Crest Trail traverses the west slope of the peak, and the West Fork Pasayten Trail traverses the eastern slope. The nearest higher peak is Devils Peak, to the north. Precipitation runoff from Slate Peak drains east into Pasayten River, or west into Slate Creek, which is in the Skagit River drainage basin. Slate Peak Fire Lookout 100px The fire lookout tower was originally constructed as a gable-roof cupola in 1924. In 1956 the Air Force leveled the mountain summit by removing 40 feet from the top of the peak (as well as the lookout) in order to install a radar station, which was never built. The present lookout sits atop a 41-foot tall tower which is maintained for emergency use. The Slate Peak Lookout was added to the National Historic Lookout Register on November 4, 2000.http://nhlr.org/lookouts/us/wa/slate-peak-lookout/ On a clear day, visitors can see Silver Star Mountain, The Needles, Tower Mountain, Golden Horn, Azurite Peak, Mount Ballard, Jack Mountain, Crater Mountain, Monument Peak, Robinson Mountain, and many others from the tower. Climate A clear view from Slate Peak's tower looking west to Jack Mountain Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences higher precipitation than the east side, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. July through September are the best months to visit in terms of favorable weather and the Forest Service access road being open for the season, however, smoke from distant wildfires may potentially reduce visibility, and smoky summer conditions have been increasing with climate change.https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2019/jun/05/wildfires-signal-climate/ Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Gated road to Slate Peak The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Why Madonna‚Äôs ‚ÄúVogue‚Äù Is Still Relevant 30 Years Later by Liam Hess (March 27, 2020) (retrieved 5 August 2020)) is a dancer, choreographer and recording artist. He is best known for his work with Madonna.  Early life  Luis Camacho was born in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He has Puerto Rican parents. Camacho trained in dance at the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School for Music and Art and the Performing Arts alongside fellow student Jose Gutierrez. At night he was a performer in the New York ballroom and dance club scene, leaving the House of Lam√© to join the House of Xtravaganza. Their signature house style was voguing, and Camacho and Gutierrez, who had also joined the House of Xtravaganza were frequent performers in the competitions. Camacho took the stage name Xtravaganza as a surname, as did his fellow club performers.  Collaboration with Madonna  In the late 1980s the singer Madonna was looking for talented dancers and was shown a home video of Camacho and Gutierrez voguing at Xtravaganza. They auditioned for her and she put them under contract to perform with her in support of her next album and tour - Blonde Ambition. The song and video, \\"Vogue\\" from the album I'm breathless, was inspired by the ballroom scene, and Camacho and Gutierrez choreographed their sections of the video, filmed by David Fincher. Their choreography was nominated for a 1990 MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography in a Video. Camacho and Gutierrez appeared in the 1990 MTV Video Awards on stage with Madonna for her Marie Antoinette performance. They appeared in a Rock the Vote public service announcement. Camacho and Gutierrez were part of the Blonde Ambition tour, which performed across North America, Europe and Asia and they appeared in the documentary film Madonna: Truth or Dare (In bed with Madonna) (1991), which followed the worldwide tour. After the Blonde Ambition tour concluded, Madonna continued to lend support to Camacho and Gutierrez, who performing under the name Jose and Luis, recorded an album, The Queen‚Äôs English. Madonna sang background vocals on this record, which was produced by Madonna's label, Maverick. Two other songs, Do it to the rhythm and You want to touch me, appeared on the 1993 Sire Records sampler, New Faces. Personal life Camacho struggled with addiction for many years following the success of the Madonna period, as he and many of the dancers from the tour transitioned into the next stage of their career and the death of many friends within the LGBTQ community due to AIDS related illnesses. He has been sober since 2004.  Film and other work  Camacho performed in the films, The Birdcage (1996) and Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) and continued to work as a dancer and choreographer. He has worked with Tony Bennett, Lisa Lisa and the Cult Jam and Aretha Franklin. He has choreographed casino shows including Carnival Cabaret for the Horizon Casino and Resort in Lake Tahoe, California. Camacho reunited with the male dancers of the Blonde Ambition tour in the documentary film, Strike a Pose (2016) which chronicled their time working with Madonna and subsequent careers. He and Jose Gutierrez were Celebrity Grand Marshals of the San Francisco Gay Pride Parade in 2018. Camacho continues to teach dance in the Los Angeles area.

It was formed in August in the Transcaucasus Military District as a Georgian National division. It saw its first action in August, 1942 with 46th Army in the Battle of the Caucasus, blocking some of the passes of the High Caucasus against the advance of the German Army Group A. Following the German retreat in the winter of 1943, the division was assigned to Southwestern Front (after October 20 the 3rd Ukrainian Front) in 46th Army until August, 1944, winning a battle honor and the Order of the Red Banner on the way. At the end of that year it was assigned to the 37th Army, which was detached from the Front to serve as a garrison unit in the Balkans after the German forces were driven north into Hungary. It remained in this relatively inactive role for the duration of the war, being disbanded shortly thereafter. Formation The 394th began forming on August 19, 1941 at Tiflis in the Transcaucasus Military District,Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 78 Its order of battle, based on the first wartime shtat (table of organization and equipment) for rifle divisions, was as follows: * 808th Rifle Regiment * 810th Rifle Regiment * 815th Rifle Regiment * 956th Artillery RegimentCharles C.

In December it was reassigned to the 46th Army in the same area. On March 15, 1942, Colonel Storozhilov handed his command to Col. Timofei Ivanovich Volkovich. In yet another change in command, on July 23 Colonel Volkovich was succeeded by Lt. Col. Ivan Georgievich Kantariya. In August the division moved with its Army into the Caucasus region to face the German and Romanian forces that were advancing there as part of Operation Blue.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 109 Battle of the Caucasus This move brought 46th Army under command of the North Caucasus Front. At this time the 46th Army consisted of the 3rd Mountain Rifle Corps, the 389th, 392nd, 394th and 406th Rifle Divisions, a rifle brigade, the 63rd Cavalry Division, a fortified region and a single battalion of tanks. On August 16 the German XXXXIX Mountain Corps took the Front commander, Marshal S. M. Budyonny, by surprise with sudden thrust into the High Caucasus mountains. By the end of the day some of the leading Axis troops had reached Klukhori Pass, which was defended by just two companies of the 1st Battalion of 815th Rifle Regiment. This advance threatened the road to the port of Sukhumi and, by extension, the entire Soviet defense of the Black Sea coast north of that port. The two companies, untrained in mountain warfare and with only meagre defenses, were pushed back.Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 415, 446-49 In reaction, 46th Army reinforced its defenses west of Klukhori Pass with the 3rd Battalion of the 815th Regiment, the division's training battalion, detachments from the Sukhumi Infantry School and the 7th NKVD Rifle Division. These reached the area on August 22, in time to halt the German advance 10 - 12km west of the pass. However, as they were not strong enough to drive them back, by the 26th they were further reinforced with the 3rd Battalion of the 810th Rifle Regiment and a regiment of the 9th Mountain Rifle Division. The combined force stymied further efforts by the German 1st Mountain Division to advance, but its own counterattacks failed due to faulty tactics. In a reorganization on August 29 the division was also given responsibility for the defense of Marukh Pass. On September 5 two battalions of the German division assaulted elements of the 808th and 810th Regiments and seized the pass two days later. In response the Front reinforced the regiments with three battalions from the 155th and 107th Rifle Brigades and the 2nd Tbilisi Infantry School. Counterattacks by these forces, which began on September 9 and continued well into October, failed to retake the pass. Farther west, two battalions of the German 4th Mountain Division attacked a company of the 808th Regiment and a mixed detachment of 7th NKVD at Sancharo Pass on August 25, again taking the pass before being halted by Soviet reinforcements, in this case designated as the Sancharo Group of Forces. This group was ordered to recapture the pass, which took until October 20 to accomplish.Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, pp. 450-51Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 109 On October 27 Lt. Colonel Kantariya was replaced in command by Col. Pavel Ivanovich Belekhov.Note that Commanders of Corps and Divisions misspells his name as \\"Selekhov\\". In November and December the 394th, still in 46th Army, was part of the Black Sea Group of Forces of Transcaucasus Front, defending against the last-ditch efforts of Army Group A to break through to one or more of the Black Sea ports.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, pp. 217-18, 241-42 As of January 1, 1943 it was still under those commands, facing two battalions of the 1st Mountain Division.Glantz, Operation Don's Main Attack, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2018, p. 25 That month, as the German forces retreated north out of the mountains, the division was assigned to the 56th Army, still in the Black Sea Group, but in March it went into the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, where it returned to 46th Army. On March 5, Col. Aleksandr Ivanovich Lisitsyn took over command of the division from Colonel Belekhov. In May the 394th and its Army were assigned to Southwestern Front.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 109 Into Ukraine Nikopol-Krivoi Rog OffensiveIn July the 394th returned to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, but it was back in the fighting front for the Donbass Offensive in August. During September the 46th Army was reassigned to Steppe Front during the advance to the Dniepr River, but by November 1 the division and its Army were back in the renamed 3rd Ukrainian Front, with the division now in the 26th Guards Rifle Corps, where it remained into December,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 206, 225, 252, 281, 310 when it was moved to the 34th Rifle Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 20 On January 10, 1944, the Front launched an attack in part with 46th Army west of the Buzuluk River against the rebuilt German 6th Army holding out in the great bend of the Dniepr, but this miscarried when the Soviet infantry failed to keep up with the tanks. Further efforts over the next three days forced the front line back about 8km at considerable cost. The offensive was renewed on January 30 after a powerful artillery preparation against the positions of the German XXX Army Corps on the same sector, but this was met with a counter- barrage that disrupted the attack. A new effort the next day, backed by even heavier artillery and air support, made progress but still did not penetrate the German line.Earl F. Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, Center of Military History United States Army, Washington, DC, 1968, pp. 240-41 On February 1 the XXX Corps line was pierced in several places and by nightfall the Soviet forces had torn a 9km-wide gap in the line west of the Buzuluk. During the next two days 6th Army tried to avoid encirclement by slogging through the mud to the Kamenka River line, which was already compromised by the Soviet advance. Forward detachments of 8th Guards Army reached Apostolovo on the 4th and over the next few days 46th Army began to attempt a sweep westward to envelop Krivoi Rog from the south. The dispersion of the Front's forces, combined with German reserves produced by the evacuation of the Nikopol bridgehead east of the Dniepr and indecision on the part of the German high command, produced \\"a peculiar sort of semiparalysis\\" on this part of the front during the second half of the month. Finally, on February 21st elements of the 46th and 37th Armies broke into the outer defenses of Krivoi Rog. To avoid costly street fighting 6th Army was withdrawn west of the city, which was liberated the next day.Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, pp. 241-44 The 394th was given a battle honor for its part in this action:During the following days the 6th Army fell back to the line of the Ingulets River but the division soon helped to force a crossing there and also took part in the liberation of the town of Novogo Buga, for which on March 19 it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. On the same day Colonel Lisitsyn was promoted to major general. =First Jassy-Kishinev Offensive= As of April 1, the 394th was still in 34th Rifle Corps with the 236th Rifle Division. The 46th was one of three armies on the right flank 3rd Ukrainian Front that were tasked with continuing the advance towards the Dniestr River while also protecting the Front's right flank. On April 8 the Army was ordered to advance to the river as rapidly as possible. 34th Corps, on the Army's left (south) flank, was to reach the river in the sector east of Raskaetsy, 30km south of Tiraspol, capture the towns of Korotnoe and Nezaertailovka near the river's east bank, force a crossing, and prepare to advance to the west. Forward detachments of the Corps reached the Dniestr late on April 11. In mid-April the Army was ordered to attack the two German strongpoints of Chebruchi and Raskaetsy. The assault on the former collapsed almost immediately but the attack by 34th Corps, which was soon reinforced by the 353rd Rifle Division, in three days of heavy fighting advanced 2 - 5km deep in an 8km wide sector south of Raskaetsy, threatening to envelop the town from the south. However, the German XXIX Army Corps reinforced the defenses at Chebruchi, allowing the 76th Infantry Division to shift most of its forces to its left wing and halt the Soviet advance. 46th Army played little subsequent role in the First Jassy-Kishinev Offensive.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2007, pp. 113-14, 133, 135, 157 Into the Balkans From May through most of August the division remained in much the same positions while the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts prepared for a new offensive. 46th Army's front now ran from the western outskirts of Talmazy all the way to the Black Sea coast. In the last days before the assault, 34th Corps concentrated the 394th and 353rd Divisions in the bridgehead over the Dniestr at Purcari, while the 236th formed the Army's reserve. The offensive opened at dawn on August 20, and during that day the stubborn strongpoint at Raskaetsy was finally captured. Overall, 46th Army achieved all of its first-day objectives. On the second day the 34th Corps continued its advance as the German 6th and Romanian 3rd Armies were being split apart by the Front's spearheads. By the 23rd, 46th Army was in the process of encircling the Romanian forces, and the division had advanced as far as Plakhtiivka, and the 259th Rifle Division had been subordinated to the Corps.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi-Kishinev Operation, ed. and trans.

It ended a 9-year period of quiescence at the volcano and continued for 22 days, during which time lava flows and lava fountains issued from the summit caldera and fissures along the northeast and southwest rift zones. Although the lava threatened Hilo, the flow stopped before reaching the outskirts of town. Precursors Repeated deformation measurements showed that the summit area of Mauna Loa began to inflate shortly after a brief summit eruption on July 5‚Äì6, 1975. This was followed by a 3-year period of slowly increasing earthquake activity beneath the volcano that included a swarm of earthquakes deep in mid-September 1983. The earthquakes reached a maximum frequency just after a 6.6 magnitude earthquake took place beneath the southeast flank of Mauna Loa, in the Ka‚Äò≈çiki fault system, on November 16, 1983. Following the Ka‚Äò≈çiki earthquake, the number of earthquakes over 1.5 magnitude increased gradually as the time of eruption approached. The immediate precursors to the 1984 eruption consisted of an abrupt increase in small earthquakes and volcanic tremor recorded on seismic stations located near Moku‚ÄòƒÅweoweo caldera. At 10:55 p.m. on March 24, small earthquakes began at a rate of 2‚Äì3 per minute. By 11:30 p.m., the seismic background increased, marking the onset of tremor. Just before 1:00 a.m. on March 25, the tremor amplitude increased to the point that the astronomical telescopes on Mauna Kea, to the northwest, could not be stabilized due to the constant ground vibration. Eruption Night time view of the 1984 eruption At 1:25 a.m., a military satellite recorded a strong infrared signal from the summit of Mauna Loa, indicating that the eruption was underway. Within just a few minutes, people throughout Hawaii island were reporting an intense red glow above the volcano. Eruptive fissures migrated rapidly down the southwest rift zone to the elevation and across the southern half of Moku‚ÄòƒÅweoweo (flow A on map). By 4:00 a.m., lava fountains extended across the northeast half of Moku‚ÄòƒÅweoweo and into the upper reaches of the northeast rift zone (flow B on map). At 10:30 a.m., intense steam emissions began along a fracture long farther down the northeast rift zone between the elevation, but no eruptive fissure formed in this area. By mid-afternoon, eruptive activity began to decrease at the uppermost vents between . At 4:41 p.m., a new fissure opened up at the elevation. This fissure rapidly migrated both uprift and downrift, so that by 6:30 p.m., a line of lava fountains slightly longer than was active. Eventually the fissure system condensed to four centers of activity with fountains up to 50 m (165 ft) high. Four parallel flows (flows D on map) moved down the northeast flank at speeds as fast as per hour. All vents uprift from these new ones quickly became inactive and the eruptive activity was confined to these vents for the next three weeks. Six large vent structures eventually formed in this area around the active vents. By daybreak on March 26, these vents were feeding lava to a fast-moving flow (flow E on map) that had advanced to the northeast and three less active, shorter flows (flows D on map) that were advancing east toward Kulani Prison. The prison was put on alert because the shorter lava flows were as close as to the prison. These flows, however, stopped advancing within 48 hours and never crossed the Powerline Road. Hawaiian Volcano Observatory geologists board a helicopter as large lava fountains erupt in the background during the 1984 eruption. Helicopters provided access to remote areas of the eruption and were essential for safety. The fast-moving flow (flow E on map) advanced as a relatively narrow, channelized ‚Äòa‚ÄòƒÅ lava flow. Its rate of advance slowed as it moved downslope, but by March 29 the flow had moved to an elevation of . At this time, the flow front was about from the outskirts of Hilo. Smoke from burning vegetation, loud explosions caused by methane gas along the advancing flow front and the intense glow at night all contributed to a growing concern among Hilo's residents. Early in the morning of March 29, a levee along the lava channel broke at the elevation about upslope from the flow front (flow E on map). The lava was diverted into a new subparallel flow (flow F on map) and flow E stagnated, temporarily relieving emergency-response officials and residents of Hilo. This new ‚Äòa‚ÄòƒÅ lava flow moved at a comparable rate to the earlier flow E, yet did not extend beyond flow E until April 4. Another significant levee breakout occurred on April 5, forming a third subparallel ‚Äòa‚ÄòƒÅ lava flow (flow G on map) that moved downslope. Concurrently, lava output at the source vents diminished slightly, and the lava became more viscous, resulting in channel blockages and levee collapses that occurred more frequently. The collapses restricted the supply of lava to the flow fronts, which moved steadily higher and more distant from the outskirts of Hilo. By April 14, no active ‚Äòa‚ÄòƒÅ lava flows extended more than from the vents, and on April 15, the eruption ended.

She casts a spell over an unattached publisher, Shepherd Henderson, partly to keep him away from a rival and partly because she is attracted to him. He falls head over heels in love with her at once and wants to marry her. But witches, unfortunately, cannot fall in love, and this minute imperfection leads into a number of difficulties. Ultimately, the lady breaks off with her companions in witchery, preferring the normal and human love offered her by the attractive publisher. But before the happy conclusion of the romance, Gillian comes very near to losing him‚Äîbut doesn‚Äôt. Regarding the play itself, author Druten stated in an interview: ‚ÄúOriginally Bell, Book and Candle was a rather more serious play, but then I asked myself what constitutes witchcraft ... and I felt the answer lies in the fact that witches primarily seem to exist for their own self-gratification. However, one has to stop living in terms of ‚Äòself‚Äô if aspects of love are ever to be realized.‚Äù Scenes The action passes throughout in Gillian Holroyd‚Äôs apartment in the Murray Hill district of New York City. *ACT I :Scene 1: Christmas Eve :Scene 2: About three hours later *Act II :Two weeks later *ACT III :Scene 1: Four hours later. :Scene 2: Two months later. Title The origin of the phrase ‚ÄúBell, Book and Candle‚Äù dates back to the 14th century.

A controversy erupted in 2015 citing set plagiarism, after a new production of the play was launched at Theatre Works New Milford in New Milford, Connecticut. The theater company immediately stopped all performances after it was noted that their set design was strikingly similar to that of the critically acclaimed revival in 2012 at Hartford Stage. Theatre Works New Milford acknowledged the similarity in an apology letter to Alexander Dodge and Darko Tresnjak, who originally designed the sets for the 2012 production, stating that their production was ‚Äúinspired‚Äù by their designs.

Elmer entered the segregated Thompson's Restaurant, next door to the offices of Forer and Rein's office at 711 14th Street NW, in Washington, DC, between H an G Streets cut by New York Avenue and across the street from the Trans-Lux Theatre. When refused service, Terrell & Co. sued. Attorney Ringgold Hart, representing Thompson, argued on April 1, 1950, that District laws were unconstitutional.

The company was founded in 2015 by William Storey and an anonymous Austrian scientist. The energy drink project began in 2009 with the development of the product, and the company was founded six years later. Information about Rich Energy Ltd. and its energy drink is very limited. Due to this, the company has been the subject of controversy regarding the existence of its product. On 16 July 2019, Rich Energy announced that they have renamed their company name to \\"Lightning Volt Ltd.\\", and on 19 July 2019 a new company was incorporated under the name \\"Rich Energy Limited\\". Information filed under Companies House also revealed that William Storey and Serbian colleague Zoran Terzic had apparently resigned as directors from the newly renamed Lightning Volt Ltd., before being reappointed on 16 August 2019. Storey stated that he had \\"sold his stake in the legal entity of Rich Energy\\". Matthew Kell was appointed as a new director of the company after Storey's apparent exit. In August 2019, Storey bought back shares from Kell to retake a majority shareholding in the company. In March 2020, Rich Energy became available online via its website.  Products  Rich Energy claims to produce the Rich Energy drink, described by the company as \\"a premium and innovative British energy drink\\". The drink contains organic sugar cane and pure mineral water from alpine spring water. The company keeps the drink's recipe a secret.  Sponsorship  Rich Energy has sponsored a number of people since its founding, including Jay Carrigan-McFarlane, Lucas Browne, Toby Sowery, Jim Walker, Dakota Schuetz, Alex Thomson, Phil Campion, and Gennadiy Golovkin. The British company also claims to sponsor the West Ham United Women football team, the Born Fearless boxing team, as well as 24 other entities. Rich Energy has also had a presence in motorsport. In March 2017, Rich Energy became a title sponsor for True Heroes Racing, a motorbike team for the British Superbike Championship. In October 2018, Rich Energy became title sponsor of the Formula One team Haas F1 Team. During a tumultuous 2019 campaign for the American team, Rich Energy eventually parted ways with them in September of that year. Originally, the company intended to get a sponsorship deal with Williams. However it is unclear whether the team rejected their offer or Rich Energy simply changed their mind. Rich Energy also attempted to purchase Sahara Force India for ¬£100 million, who had been put into administration by the High Court at the time. Storey claimed the deal had been finalised, however this was denied by the Indian racing team. In February 2020, Rich Energy was announced as the new title sponsor of British Superbike Championship race winners OMG Racing in a multi-million pound deal. In July 2020, Rich Energy was announced as a sponsor of BTCC driver Michael Crees, who drives for BTC Racing.https://btcracing.co.uk/fan-favourite-british-touring- car-star-michael-crees-links-up-with-rich- energy/?fbclid=IwAR0erlJPlSlxGITD7PouWh6bmZPEeu7LhHYQJCP35ZenN2LGxoR_LwqML2g  Controversies  = Brand legitimacy = Controversies regarding Rich Energy's credibility began to spread in the days following Rich Energy's attempt to purchase the Sahara Force India racing team. Internet forums and social media posts questioned the legitimacy of the company. The company's financial documentation became exposed through Companies House. Former CEO William Storey had denied the claims multiple times, stating that Rich Energy had produced 90 million drink cans, and that it was backed with ¬£4 billion worth of endorsements despite there being no financial information corroborating this claim. = Copyright infringement = In May 2019, Rich Energy Ltd. was involved in a court case with Whyte Bikes due to the Stag (Male Deer) logo being used by Rich Energy bearing too close a resemblance to the logo used by the bicycle company. Rich Energy lost the case, the judge declaring that Rich Energy had misled the court by claiming they did not previously know about Whyte Bikes. On 18 July 2019, the Rich Energy Twitter account leaked alleged court documents, suggesting that the company, as well as former CEO William Storey, would be facing legal proceedings by Austrian energy drink company Red Bull GmbH in relation to Rich Energy's advertising slogan because Storey was regularly using Red Bull's own advertising slogans against them. = Sponsorship with Haas F1 = On 10 July 2019, the Rich Energy Twitter account announced that the company had ended its sponsorship of Formula One constructor Haas F1 Team, saying that Rich Energy had terminated their title sponsorship deal due to the team's poor performance and Formula One Group's politics and attitude. The announcement from the energy drink brand came as \\"a surprise\\" to Guenther Steiner, Haas's team principal. The following day, the company's shareholders attempted to disown the announcement, stating that the apparent termination of the sponsorship deal was \\"the rogue actions of one individual\\". The company also stated that it was \\"in the process of removing the individual from all executive responsibilities\\". Former CEO William Storey later accused his company's shareholders of \\"mounting a coup\\" in relation to the Haas F1 team sponsorship. On 9 September 2019, a day after the Italian Grand Prix, Haas F1 announced the termination of the deal with Rich Energy with immediate effect.

The group describes itself as a movement \\"for liberation and socialism\\" with an extra-parliamentary focus, and a membership composed of various prison-abolitionist, anti-imperialist and anti- poverty activists. Shortly after its public announcement, the organisation engaged in a series of direct action campaigns, including joining the blockade of New Zealand Defence Industry Association forums, occupying the Brazilian embassy after the inauguration of Jair Bolsonaro, occupying the United States consulate in Auckland during the 2019 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt, and joining the occupation of IhumƒÅtao. The group has also organised broader mobilisations such as the 2018 protests agitating for abortion reform. Principles and policies Organise Aotearoa describes itself as \\"a new movement for liberation and socialism\\". In a statement of principles released on 1 October 2018, the organisation's policies were stated to be: * Constitutional transformation, including decolonisation through the concepts of Tino Rangatiratanga, Tikanga and Mana motuhake. * Socialist revolution in order to abolish capitalism and establish workplace democracy * Environmentalism through the abolition of corporate agency * Implementation of socialist policies and ending bourgeois control of the State * Ending violence against women, transphobia, racialisation in New Zealand prisons and ableism * Direct democracy * Anti-imperialism * Implementation of policy through direct action History =Formation= Organise Aotearoa was first formed around Sue Bradford's Economic and Social Research Aotearoa (ESRA) think tank in 2016 and later expanded to include activists from People Against Prisons Aotearoa (PAPA), the Peace Action Movement and Auckland Action Against Poverty. The organisation also included Marxist-Leninists at the time of its public announcement. As of October 2019, the organisation claims a membership of over 140 active members, with branches in Auckland, Wellington, Hamilton and Dunedin. =Direct action protests= Organise Aotearoa has received media coverage in New Zealand and Brazil for their direct action interventions on several issues. Most notable among these was the occupation of the Brazilian embassy in Wellington to protest the inauguration of the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro. Occupiers displayed the slogan \\"No relations with fascist nations,\\" and news of the occupation was widely shared by both left-wing and right-wing Brazilian media, including Carlos Bolsonaro, eventually going viral across the country. The subsequent backlash from the Brazilian right resulted in \\"thousands of homophobic insults, death threats, and rape threats [that were] sent to OA's supporters and members.\\" The group blockaded the New Zealand Defence Industry Association forum, or \\"Weapons Expo\\", in conjunction with the Peace Action Movement and Palmerston North locals. The 2018 blockade was considered successful by organisers, and resulted in arms industry delegates failing to attend the forum, as well as several arrests. In February 2019, the organisation occupied the US Auckland consulate, and as of June 2019, has members involved in the indigenous land occupation at IhumƒÅtao.

Biography  Born in 1943 in Barcelona, he is son of Narc√≠s de Carreras, who was personal secretary of Francesc Camb√≥ and who would later become President of FC Barcelona (1968‚Äì1969) and President of La Caixa. He became a member of the clandestine Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC) in 1967. He left the PSUC in 1986 over concerns the party line was drifting towards Nationalist stances. He was a prominent member of the Foro Babel, a civil forum created to denounce the language policy enforced by the Catalan regional governments presided by Jordi Pujol. In June 2005, he took part in the \\"For a new political party in Catalonia\\" manifesto that would pave the way for the later foundation of Citizens‚ÄìParty of the Citizenry (Cs), party of which Carreras has been referred as one of its \\"leading ideologists\\". Tenured professor in possession of a Chair in Constitutional Law at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), he retired in September 2013. Elected as numerary member of the Royal Academy of Moral and Political Sciences in January 2015, he took possession of the medal number 27 on 15 November 2016, covering the vacant left by Manuel Jim√©nez de Parga (his PhD thesis supervisor), reading a speech titled Ensayos sobre el federalismo (\\"Essays about the Federalism\\"). Carreras has been a critic of the rightwing drift of Cs driven by party leader Albert Rivera (his former pupil), warning in 2019 that the later would be \\"putting alleged party interests ahead of the interests of Spain\\" and that Rivera had turned into a \\"capricious teenager\\". In July 2019, Carreras, one of the party's founders, announced that he had left the party due to its stances against the PSOE and in favor of alliances with the far-right.

Member of Polish resistance (Home Army) during World War II, he died in the controversial 1943 Gibraltar B-24 crash.  Life  Gralewski was born on 3 March 1912 in Warsaw. He graduated from the University of Warsaw's philosophy department where he studied under W≈Çadys≈Çaw Tatarkiewicz. He researched topics related to philosophy and literary theory, publishing several articles and essays on those topics even before graduating the university. Before World War II he published some essays in Arkady and ≈ªycie Sztuki. He continued writing and publishing during the war, while at the same time joining Polish resistance (ZWZ, Home Army) where he became a courier travelling between the occupied Poland and the Polish government in exile in the West. He was also involved in the underground education initiatives. In 1942 he married poet and scholar Alicja Iwa≈Ñska, then also a resistance member.  Death and remembrance  On 4 July 1943, Gralewski most likely died in the 1943 Gibraltar B-24 crash, together with the Polish Prime Minister and commander-in-chief, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski. Due to the controversy surrounding Sikorski's death, some conspiracy theories surrounding this incident have raised questions regarding the role and fate of Gralewski in this incident, with suggestions by historians Dariusz Baliszewski and that he might have been shot by an assassin, and died ashore, not in the airplane crash, and that the assassin entered the airplane acting as his doppelganger. His wife, who after the war became a sociologist in the United States, wrote about her belief that he was murdered as a part of an assassination plot in her 1987 book Niezdemobilizowani. In late 2000s and early 2010s the Polish Institute of National Remembrance considered exhumation of Gralewski's body to address this issue, but eventually decided against it.

By May 2018, there were over 30 projects, and short-haul hybrid-electric airliners were envisioned from 2032.  History  The Boeing Truss-Braced Wing subsonic concept was planned with hybrid electric propulsion. The Diamond DA36 E-Star first flew on 8 June 2011, the first flight of a series hybrid powertrain, reducing fuel consumption and emissions by up to 25%, a technology scalable to a 100-seater airliner. A small and lighter Austro Engine 40 hp (30 kW) Wankel engine generates the electricity, supplemented by EADS batteries for silent take off, feeding a Siemens 70 kW (94 hp) electric motor turning the propeller. The AgustaWestland Project Zero was intended to be hybrid- electric. = 2011 = Nasa sponsored a centennial challenge to encourage the development of the world's most fuel-efficient airplane. The contest got co- sponsored by Google and was conducted in California skies. Amongst the entrants was the world's first parallel gas-electric hybrid aircraft called the EcoEagle, built by students of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, two electric airplanes - the Pipistrel Taurus G4 and the eGenius. = 2014 = Faradair Aerospace launches a Triple Box-wing hybrid electric aircraft concept Called the BEHA (Bio Electric Hybrid Aircraft) as one of the world's first regional aircraft specifically designed for hybrid electric regional flight. The UK start-up has continued development from the initial concept to the latest BEHA M1H variant, with future opportunity for unmanned and all electric variants. The E-STOL BEHA has gained support from key members of the UK Government and the airframe development has been conducted at Swansea University. = 2017 = Zunum Aero, backed by Boeing and JetBlue, is working since 2014 on a family of 10- to 50-seat hybrid electric regional aircraft. On 5 October 2017, Zunum launched the development of a six-to-12-seat aircraft. Aiming to fly in 2020 and be delivered in 2022, it should lower operating costs by 40‚Äì80% to reach available seat miles (ASM) costs of a 78-seat Dash 8-Q400. On 28 November 2017, Airbus announced a partnership with Rolls-Royce plc and Siemens to develop the E-Fan X hybrid-electric airliner demonstrator, to fly in 2020. (Airbus, Rolls-Royce, Siemens) = 2018 = The 1,300-shp GE Catalyst could be used in hybrid-electric propulsion: in late 2016, General Electric modified a GE F110 fighter turbofan to extract 250 kW from its turbine and 750 kW from its turbine, supported by the USAF Research Laboratory and NASA, developed and tested a 1-megawatt electric motor/generator with GE Global Research, and tested a liquid-cooled inverter converting 2,400-volt DC to three-phase AC with silicon carbide-based switches and 1.7-kW MOSFET power modules. By May 2018, consulting firm Roland Berger counted almost 100 electric aircraft in development. This was up from 70 the previous year and included 60% from startups, 32% from aerospace incumbents, half of them major OEMs and 8% from academic, government organizations and non-aerospace companies, mainly from Europe (45%) and the U.S. (40%). Mostly urban air taxis (50%) and general aviation aircraft (47%), a majority are battery-powered (73%), while some are hybrid-electric (31%), mostly larger airliners. Industry experts expects a 50+ seat hybrid-electric airliner to debut in commercial operation by 2032 for routes like London-Paris. By November of 2018, Zunum Aero offices have been closed and all 70 staff members laid off as the programme comes to an end. The potential of electric and hybrid-electric propulsion remains limited for general aviation, according to Textron Aviation, as the specific energy of electricity storage is still 2% of aviation fuel. An hybrid configuration is needed for airliners: lithium-ion batteries including packaging and accessories gives 160 Wh/kg while aviation fuel gives 12,500 Wh/kg. As electric machines and converters are more efficient, their shaft power available is closer to 145 Wh/kg of battery while a gas turbine gives 6,545 Wh/kg of fuel: a :1 ratio. For Collins Aerospace, this 1:50 ratio forbids electric and hybrid-electric propulsion for long-range aircraft, as a mission for an all-electric, 12-passenger aircraft would require a six-fold increase while three-fold increase is projected between 2019 and 2029. Roland Berger observes the best Li-ion batteries achieve 300 Wh/kg by 2019, enough for small aircraft, while a regional airliner would need a 500 Wh/kg battery pack. For MTU, an electric, limited-range Airbus A320-sized single-aisle would need 2 kWh/kg from 0.25 kWh/kg in 2019 to enter service 30 years later. Pipistrel Panthera The EU funded the Hypstair program with ‚Ç¨6.55 million over three years till 2016 for a TRL of 4: a Pipistrel Panthera mockup received a serial hybrid-electric powertrain, ground testing a 200-kW motor driven by batteries only, by a 100-kW generator-only and by both combined. It is followed by Mahepa project from 2017, EU-funded over four years with ‚Ç¨9 million under the Horizon 2020 research program to reduce aviation carbon emissions by 70% in 2050, till TRL 6 before entering product development. The Panthera drivetrain will be divided in modules: electric motor thrust generator and internal combustion power generator in the nose, human-machine interface and computing, fuel and batteries in the wing. Ground testing is planned for 2019 before flight tests in 2020. The Pipistrel Taurus G4 taking off from the Sonoma County Airport in California The dual-fuselage, four-seat, battery-powered Pipistrel Taurus G4 received a DLR hydrogen fuel cell powertrain to fly as the HY4 in September 2016, with hydrogen tanks and batteries in the fuselages, fuel cells and motor in the central nacelle. Partners are German motor and inverter developer Compact Dynamics, Ulm University, TU Delft, Politecnico di Milano and University of Maribor. Ground and flight tests should follow those of the Panthera a couple of months later. Along their ground handling, scaling to 19- and 70-seat airliners will be studied in two configurations: more of the same size modules for electric distributed propulsion, or larger sized modules extrapolating the flight-test results, powering twin propellers. Flights will test system behavior, measure performance and reliability, and evaluate failure modes. A failure rate of one per 10 million hours is targeted, as low as in airliners, with very reliable components or with redundancy. Austrian company ScaleWings, developer of a P-51 Mustang scale replica, has developed a hybrid and redundant piston/electric engine, based on independent modules: a four-stroke V-twin producing when turbocharged, and electric motors, producing combined. VoltAero is a startup company formed in September 2017 by the CTO and test pilot of the 2014 Airbus E-Fan 1.0, located in Royan and established with the support of the French Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. The company is developing a hybrid testbed based on the Cessna 337 Skymaster, which it intends to fly in late February 2019. The clean-sheet, all-composite VoltAero Cassio prototype should follow in 2020, before deliveries in late 2021 or early 2022. It will be powered by two electric motors driving tractor propellers on the wing and a piston engine and motor driving a pusher propeller in the aft fuselage. The combination of fuel and batteries will give it a range with nine people aboard. On 31 October 2018, Diamond Aircraft flew the , funded by Germany‚Äôs economics ministry and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency, reaching and within 20 minutes. It is a modified DA40 with its single piston engine replaced by two Siemens electric motors in the nose powered by a Austro Engine AE 300 diesel or two batteries, for a 5 h. endurance or 30 min. on batteries only. = 2019 = By January 2019, U.S. startup Ampaire was replacing the Cessna 337 Skymaster (a push-pull aircraft) aft piston engine with an electric motor, to fly the prototype on Hawaiian Mokulele Airlines commuter routes operated with Cessna Caravans. Seven other airlines are interested by Caravan or Twin Otter conversions: Seattle‚Äôs Kenmore Air, Tropic Air of Belize, Puerto Rico-based Vieques Air Link, Southern Airways Express of Memphis, Tennessee, Guernsey‚Äôs Aurigny and Star Marianas Air, based in the Northern Mariana Islands, as well as Norway. Test flights will take place on a route over 15 minutes between Kahului Airport in Central Maui and Hana Airport on the East side. The hybrid prototype held its first public test flight on June 6, 2019, before scheduled service planned for 2021. Personal Airline Exchange (PAX) became the launch customer for the Ampaire Electric EEL modified six-seat Skymaster, to be certified in 2021, with an order for 50 plus 50 options. By March 2019, UTC was converting a 39-seat Bombardier Dash 8 Q100 into a hybrid- electric for demonstration flights from 2022 within its Project 804. The design is similar to the Airbus E-Fan X program, but aims for certification and production for a subsequent commercial offer. One PW121 turboprop will be replaced by a gas turbine joined with an electric motor of the same rating, powered by off-the-shelf lithium-ion batteries for takeoff and climb. The turbine is used alone in cruise and drives the motor-generator to recharge the batteries in descent. The downsized engine operates at its optimum for 30% fuel savings over . Range is reduced from due to the higher empty weight and 50% lower fuel capacity. Faradair Aerospace launched its 18 seat BEHA M1H during Revolution.aero in March, London, with turboprop hybrid propulsion and 'quick change' passenger/cargo capability, targeting the CS23/Part23 commuter category regulations. The E-STOL aircraft capable of operation on runways of less than 300m with 5 tonne payload from its unique Triple box-wing configuration and quiet ducted fan pusher configuration. At the June 2019 Paris Air Show, Daher, Airbus and Safran teamed up to develop the TBM-based EcoPulse demonstrator, with half of the ‚Ç¨22 million ($25 million) demonstration funded by the DGAC. The maiden flight is scheduled for the summer of 2022 before a hypothetical 2025-30 certification. The aircraft‚Äôs existing engine will be supplemented by six safran electric motor on the wing fed by a APU or batteries. Similar to the NASA X-57 Maxwell, the distributed propulsion reduces wingtip vortices and add low speed lift by blowing the wing, enabling a smaller, lower drag wing. A mid-May 2019 survey for UBS shows 38% of Americans and Germans said they would be likely to fly in a hybrid- electric airplane, rising to more than 50% for 18-44-year-olds. UBS thinks hybrid aircraft for up to nine passengers over short routes below could be available from 2022, and 2028 for regional airliners up to 1 h routes. UBS forecast a market for 16,000 hybrid-electric airplanes and $178-192 billion over 2028-40, mostly in general aviation, light business jets and regional aircraft with 20% lower operating costs than present 50-70 seaters. Led by Cranfield Aerospace Solutions (CAeS), Project Fresson started on 1 October 2019, to fly an electric Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander within 30 months before an EASA STC within another 6-12 months. It targets a 60 min endurance plus 30 min reserves and with energy five times cheaper than Avgas and reduced maintenance, the conversion cost could be recovered in three years and it would have a range-extender combustion engine. Half of the ¬£18 million ($22 million) funding come from the partners and the other half from the UK government. Of 800 Islanders in service, around 600 are used for short flights. Loganair should use it for short interisland hops off northern Scotland. Electric EEL developer Ampaire and aircraft modification specialist Ikhana Aircraft Services study a 19 seat, diesel-electric hybrid de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter. It could use Ikhana's STC for an increased MTOW from , the study is expected to be completed by the end of 2019. = 2020 = Supported by Bavarian funding, the German DLR is modifying one of its two Do 228 into an hybrid-electric demonstrator. The first fully electric flight is planned for 2020 and the first hybrid-electric flight for 2021, apparently from Cochstedt Airport. Partners include MTU Aero Engines and Siemens, of which Rolls-Royce plc is acquiring the electric propulsion unit. In April of 2020, the E-FanX programme supported by Rolls-Royce plc, Airbus and Siemens is cancelled. By July 2020, Faradair Aerospace announces relocation to Duxford Airfield, Cambridgeshire, UK in partnership with the Imperial War Museum and Gonville & Caius College to develop the BEHA M1H prototype hybrid electric regional aircraft from a new bespoke prototyping facility as part of the new Duxford Avtech aerospace research and development campus. First flight is targeted for late 2023/early 2024. = 2021 = The Berlin-Brandenburg Aerospace Alliance is a business cluster that includes Rolls-Royce Dahlewitz, MTU Aero Engines, aeronautical engineering specialist APUS and Stemme. It plans the -i6 project, a 19-seat distributed electric propulsion demonstrator to fly in 2021 with turbodiesel, gas turbine and fuel-cell generators. Separate from this i-6, the APUS i-5 will be a twin-boom testbed with tandem seating for a 4 t (8,800 lb) gross-weight. A Rolls-Royce 250 turboshaft will drive four electric propellers through a battery, generators, convertors, and power controls. Supported by the German state of Brandenburg and the Brandenburg University of Technology, flights should begin after 2021.

Description  Tawera spissa is 20-25 mm in length and has a triangular shape with oblong valves. Each valve has rows of ridges. The valves are often white with a variety of brown patterning, but can also be completely white or completely brown in colour. On the internal surface, the valves are white, with brown adductor scars.  Habitat  Individuals occupy fine to coarse sand and light gravel substrates just below the surface. Their depth range is typically slightly below the low tide mark down to 200m in depth. They tend to be found in areas where there is some water movement. Tawera spissa may be the dominant species in subtidal benthic zones alongside Purpurocardia purpurata in widespread open coastal communities or with Zemysina globus in more sheltered conditions such as bays in southern New Zealand.
