After her father's death in 1951, she took over the ailing family manufacturing business with her brother, which they successfully saved and sold four years later. Career After graduation from Smith in 1945, Schwartz sought to address the extremely low number of African American students at the college. Because she had been one of only a few Jewish students at her high school, Schwartz empathized with the isolation of African Americans at Smith. That same year she founded the National Scholarship Service and Fund for Negro Students. The organization petitioned colleges and universities to open their doors to African American applicants, and matched qualified students with available scholarship money. In 1951, Schwartz left the organization to help manage the family business. However, she soon encountered the unpleasant realities of running a company as a woman,Baldwin, Louis. Women of Strength. pg 87. and she left to become a full-time mother after the birth of her second child. She had a third child and ultimately was out of the workforce for nine years. During this time, she became frustrated by the obstacles preventing educated mothers such as herself from entering or re-entering the workforce. In 1962, Schwartz contacted the presidents of several colleges, and a handful of them became the board of directors of Catalyst, Inc., a new organization that she hoped would address the issues she and others had experienced as businesswomen and mothers. At the time, Catalyst's mission was \\"to bring to our country's needs the unused capacities of educated women who want to combine family and work.\\" Schwartz went on to lead Catalyst as its president for 30 years until her retirement in 1993. Over her career, Schwartz was a prolific writer. The piece that she is probably best known for, entitled \\"Management Women and the New Facts of Life,\\" was published in the Harvard Business Review in 1989. The article was interpreted as suggesting that companies create two career paths to accommodate women who wish to balance career and family and women whose careers are their primary concern.

It conducts water control activities in the general area known as Rijnland. The Netherlands has 21 Waterboards or Waterschappen acting independently from the National government administration to manage the continuing Dutch struggle against water.:nl:Lijst van Nederlandse waterschappen History Count William II of Holland Granting Privileges in 1255 to the local Dike-wardens of Spaarndam by Caesar van Everdingen, 1654, originally commissioned for the Gemeenlandshuis Zwanenburg in Halfweg, and today in the collection of the Gemeenlandshuis Rijnland in Leiden Heraldic shields of the Halfweg Water Board members in 1646, the year that the Water Board built this house for board meetings, on the facade of the Gemeenlandshuis Zwanenburg in Halfweg. The first steps towards a formal method of dike management were taken in the 12th century when the Oude Rijn river silted shut at Katwijk. Even though the Lek river had already superseded the Oude Rijn as the most important means of transport and water management, the area around Leiden suffered dramatically from storm flooding. To combat this problem, the local nobility of Leiden decided to build a dam at Zwadenburg, now called Zwammerdam. This of course only moved the problem eastwards, towards Utrecht, where they complained to the German emperor Barbarossa. In 1165, he decided in favor of Utrecht and the dam was turned into a sluice. Meanwhile, work had already started on digging to increase the efficiency of the small rivers called the \\"Zyl\\" and \\"Does\\", which would carry the overflow towards the Haarlem Lake and the Kagerplassen.Website of the Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland This ambitious project was the result of 15 neighborhoods working together towards a common goal. By 1255, according to the oldest dated document in the Rijnland archives, there was already a group of officials called heemraden who oversaw the dikes along the IJ and at Zwammerdam. Their privileges were described in this document that was given to the dike warden of the area between Wassenaar, the Zwammerdam, and Spaarndam. At that time Rijnland was just one of the many water districts within the area. Each district had a bailiff, and it was the bailiff who was put in charge of dike maintenance. The term Dijkgraaf (official) only began to be used around 1400, when the water district borders differed greatly from the borders of the nearby municipalities. The success of the Zijl and Does river outlets was not enough to avoid heavy floods, and in 1248, a heavy storm again caused a lot of damage, so a dam was built at Spaarndam. This caused a fierce dispute with Haarlem, since that city was dependent on free access for ships to the IJ. The dispute was solved by building an extra sluice in 1253 for ships that could pass when the water levels on both sides of the sluice were the same.De Kleine Haarlemmer sluis on the website of the North Holland Archives To emphasize that control over the sluices and dikes at Spaarndam were under the jurisdiction of the Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland, Count Willem II granted the privileges to levy a toll on ships to the Dike wardens, and not to the city of Haarlem. It is this document from 1255 that is referred to in the painting by Caesar van Everdingen in 1654. From that point on, the heemraden at Spaarndam were called the heemraden van Rijnland. This would not be the last time that the city of Haarlem got into an argument with the Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland. In 1514 a heavy storm broke the sluices and the dike at Spaarndam. Haarlem was happy to have the free passage of ships and refused to repair the dike. When the Hof van Holland decided in favor of repairs, Haarlem asked to have the dam (and sluices with their tolls) moved closer to the city. This would mean that Haarlem would have the dam on its own property, and they would have more control. The heemraden voted against it, and repairs were ordered. In 1517 the dam was not yet ready and Haarlem sent soldiers to destroy the work underway. Again the Hof van Holland needed to mediate the heated tempers and again the decision was in favor of the Heemraden. Haarlem was allowed its own sluice gate for small ships, the Klein Haarlemmersluis, which kept working until 1897, when a new sluice was built. To manage the finances of building and maintaining the dam and all its sluices, it was decided to split the costs (and toll income) among the water boards downstream. Haarlem paid for its own sluice gate, and the Woerdersluis was paid for by the Water board called the Grootwaterschap Woerden, which also released its water overflow via the Spaarndam sluices. Gemeenlandshuis The management of these complicated funding arrangements led to the formation of a new governing body in addition to the hoogheemraden, and these were the hoofdingelanden. These were large landowners with the Water board district who could oversee and approve the finances of the Water board. For several centuries, the daily work of the Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland was run by one Dike warden and seven hoogheemraden, of which two came from Haarlem and five from Leiden. Their responsibilities were traditionally to oversee the dam at Spaarndam and the dikes along the Zijl and the Does. To meet efficiently, the Hoogheemraadschap bought a meeting hall in 1578, that was also the permanent residence of the Dike warden. The facade was renovated twenty years later in 1598 to keep up with the new town hall. This Gemeenlandshuis is the first one used by the Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland, but to meet with the Amsterdam Water Board and inspect the dikes along the Haarlemmertrekvaart and the sluices at Halfweg, the Gemeenlandshuis Zwanenburg was built by Pieter Post in 1645-1648. Though nearly demolished today, there is a town named after this building in the Haarlemmermeerpolder called Zwanenburg.

Since its inception, there has been progress in this field that is of particular importance to the international community. =Negotiations= Negotiation in the context of the United Nations Security Council tends to be intensive and time-consuming and may be trying for those who have little patience. Negotiations normally occur inside one of the UN conference rooms, but in some cases there will be informal negotiations among members to find an agreed outcome. This interplay of formal and informal negotiation contributes to the fluidity and active dynamics of the process itself. A certain outcome can be agreed after a few meetings but other can consume considerable amount of time that span to months of negotiation. This is due to the complexity and sensitivity of the issue at hand that one single word would need long hour of negotiation as it can be interpreted in various ways depending on the national interests of the concerned countries and other factors. Take for example negotiation on a resolution on one particular issue, one of the operative paragraphs can generate heated debate whether the Security Council should \\"take note\\" the report from the Secretary General, or should the Security Council just \\"acknowledge with appreciation the report\\" or \\"welcome the report\\". In most cases, the Security Council should welcome or at minimum acknowledge with appreciation the report since in most cases reports by the Secretary General is in compliance with the explicit request of the Security Council. This issue can generate such a long debate because the report might contain elements that are directly or indirectly affecting the national interests of one of the members. On one side, \\"to acknowledge with appreciation\\" might be construed as challenging or undermining the said country. On the other side, \\"to acknowledge with appreciation\\" can be used as a negotiating tool to put pressures on the said country that viewed it as a threat or challenging its national interests. It is worth to note as well that reports of the Secretary- General can be highly political and sensitive. Here, we generally use the term Secretary-General to refer to the UN Secretariat that is mandated to render services to the Member-States of the United Nations that are currently composed of countries (including, annual and thematic reports) It is worth noting that negotiation in the UN setting is typically a multi-party negotiation where there are more than two countries that are involved in the negotiation. Since there are more than two countries, there are multiple interests that have to be considered and accommodated. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict is a member of the United Nations Development Group.

They are traditionally involved in basket weaving, fishing and lime burning. They are chiefly found in the districts of Ramanathapuram, rameswaram Thirunelveli and Tiruchirappalli of Tamil Nadu. Etymology The term Katesar, also spelled Kataisar, means \\"one who churns\\", derived from the Tamil term katai meaning \\"to mash\\" or \\"to grind\\". The name is derived from a folk lore where their ancestors churned butter and offered it to the thirsty Devas (term for Hindu deity) who fought against the Asuras (term for Hindu demons) for a noble cause. They were formerly divided into endogamous subdivisions known as Pattamkatti and Nittarasan. Pattamkatti is a title conferred on maritime headmen, meaning \\"diadem crowned\\". The term Nittarasan literally meaning \\"lime king\\", derives from the Tamil terms nittu meaning \\"to dissolve\\" as in dissolving limestone in water, and arasan meaning \\"king\\". From an order of the king of Rameswaram, several communities were engaged in the construction of a temple. While the other communities used oridnary conch shell in the construction, the Katesars used a special coch shell known as valumpuri. The construction made by the Katesars were the strongest, and they were therefore conferred the title Nittarasan by the king of Rameswaram. Katesar might be a shortened form of the word 'Karaiyar Arasar', which means kings of coastal inhabitants. History There have been stone carvings and copper plates that mention the Pattamkattiyars. These are found in big temple, tanjavur and in other places. A stone bearing the name of a person called \\"Perumal Patamkatti\\" dating 900 AD was found in Kanyakumari. They have seven exogamous sub-divisions known as Keelai. In the war between the Idangai and Valangai, the Katesars sided with the Kammalar who belonged to the Idangais. The Katesans lost the battle with only seven men standing. Each men took wife from different castes and thereby forming a subdivision. The following subdivisions are Kuttini (from a Kusuvar woman), Nƒìttali (from a Paravar woman), Attukkutti (from an Idaiyar woman), Thomba Puluvan (from a Thomban woman), Nayinan Chakravarthi (from a Panar woman), Kavadi (from a Shanar woman), and Tachilai (from a Vannar woman). In the Katesar society, the maternal uncle's responsibility is more than the parents' responsibility. Some of the Katesar of Tirunelveli, Ramanad and Tuticorin were converted by St. Francis Xavier and other priests starting from 1536. Their mangalsutra/thali worn during marriage are similar to Pillai. Their marriage customs find similarity with Brahmins and Pillais. With the passing of time, the Pattamkattiyars separated themselves from rest of the Pandiyan community and they formed an individual caste with their own customs.

Early life and education Headley was born in West Virginia in 1906. When he was six his mother, an organist, moved the family to California. At ten years old he was introduced to Maurice Ravel, whose music had a strong effect on him. He studied music at the University of the Pacific, graduating in 1928, and then at the Eastman School of Music until 1937. Career From 1939 to 1954 Headley taught at the University of Santa Barbara. During that time he succeeded Maurice Faulkner as conductor of the University of California Symphony Orchestra in Santa Barbara, becoming known both as a composer and as a pianist and giving concerts in which he conducted his own works, for example in Paris, London, Budapest and Prague. After 1954 he moved to Seattle to teach at the Cornish School of Applied Arts. Death and legacy After a short period in Seattle, Headley moved to Vancouver. He also moved to Sudbury, Ontario, Canada where he developed the music program at Cambrian College in the late 60's and early 70's. He left for Vancouver where he remained until his death. His music is today virtually unknown, and many of his works are lost. In 2006 his music resurfaced by accident. Robert Buckley, one of his students, and Stan MacDaniel took joint responsibility for the recordings of his music in 2007. In 2006, for the 100th anniversary of Headley's birth, Russian State TV performed several of its compositions, including the California Suite, conducted by Dmitry Yablonsky, a conductor who has focussed on bringing forgotten or unknown music to audiences. After this, the Naxos record label published a CD of Headley's music in an \\"American Classics\\" series.

Cottam is the author of Radical Help: how we can remake the relationships between us and revolutionise the Welfare State. The book has been described as ‚Äòmind-shifting‚Äô and '[addressing] the questions we ought to be facing‚Äô. A renowned thinker and innovator on the reform of the welfare state, Cottam has designed and led large scale systemic innovation projects focusing on: employment, the prevention and management of chronic conditions, elder care, prison reform and family services. Working with communities across Britain and in Europe Cottam has worked to collaboratively design approaches that have changed thousands of lives. Transformation is achieved through a model that emphasises human relationships supported by technology. Cottam argues that we need a social revolution: deep socio-economic change driven by technology combined with the demand to address climate change, requires us to think, work and organise in radical new ways. Her writing and practical collaborations around the theme of a fifth Social Revolution are at the core of her current work. Cottam is credited as the pioneer of social design and was named UK Designer of the Year in 2005 for her ground-breaking methodology which fuses anthropology, psychoanalysis, business tools and a design process. Work In the 1990s, Cottam worked with UNICEF and the World Bank. As an urban poverty specialist at the World Bank, she worked in Southern Africa to develop a radical participatory approach to assessing and reducing urban poverty. Returning to the UK in 1998, Cottam set up two award-winning social enterprises: School Works Ltd (now the British Council for School Environments) which was ranked within Britain's top 100 creative companies and the Do Tank Ltd. Between 2001 and 2006 Cottam was a Director at the UK Design Council where she started the RED Unit and a new programme of work on the transformation of public services. Working with IDEO CEO Colin Burns, Cottam developed Transformation Design a pioneering approach in which design methods were applied to social change. In 2006 Cottam started Participle, a 10 year experiment to develop and test exemplars of a 21st century welfare state. Participle‚Äôs work garnered a world-wide reputation both for the innovative new working methodologies used and for the social impact of a series of new social enterprises and services (new approaches to ageing, family services, youth services, chronic disease and unemployment). Cottam has worked as an advisor to governments in Europe, Latin America and Africa and has sat on the advisory board of not for profit organisations and a FTSE 100 company. She is a regular commentator on social issues in the mainstream media. Education Dr. Cottam was educated at Oxford University (Modern History B.A Hons) and Sussex University (M.Phil with Distinction in International Studies) and holds a Doctorate from the Open University in social sciences. Cottam has undertaken post-doctoral study at Harvard and the LSE. She is currently a visiting Professor at UCL. Recognition, honours and awards In 2005, Cottam was named UK Designer of the Year with her blueprints that combine elements of architecture and policy for schools, health services, and prisons. In 2007 the World Economic Forum named Cottam as a Young Global Leader in recognition of her work on social change. Her work has been featured in numerous design books (most recently Hello World) and in exhibitions in the UK Design Council, the Smithsonian, and most recently as one of 8 designers feature in the 100 year celebrations of the Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna (MAK). Cottam was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to the British welfare state.

The origins of the state date back at least to 15th century, when the Oba Ozolua \\"the Conqueror\\" (c. 1481‚Äì1504) fathered the Alani of Idoani, which he made a vassal state of the Benin Empire. Early years The present confederacy, which dates to 1880, includes six eastern Yoruba communes: Ido, Amusigbo, Isure, Iyayu, Isewa and Ako. Some of these had two concurrent rulers in the past. The communities that formed the confederacy had suffered during the 19th century wars, with many people migrating to other areas. During the struggle with the combined forces of Ijesha and Ekiti in 1879 they were forced to ask for help from Ibadan, and formed the confederacy the next year. British missionaries introduced Christianity in the late 19th century, along with new farming methods, and Idoani became part of the Lagos colony, later the protectorate of Nigeria. The communities were merged in 1921. The first confederate traditional ruler was appointed after the death of Alani Adesunloye Atewogboye on 3 January 1921. Falade I ruled as Alani from 1921 to 1958, and was succeeded by Akingboye Falade II on his death. Disputed succession In the early 1970s, Akingboye Falade II died and a temporary regent was installed by the traditional authorities, who ended up ruling for 14 years due to a dispute between the chiefs and the government over the succession process. The military government then installed an Alani of their choice in the traditional ruler's palace, who was accepted by some but not all of the chiefs. When the civilian Bamidele Olumilua became governor (1992‚Äì1993) he imposed traditional law, and Oba Aderemi Atewogboye was elected. However, the usurper remained in the palace, and the town was divided between the two. After the return to military rule, the Administrator of Ondo State from August 1996 to August 1998, Anthony Onyearugbulem, presented the staff of office to the rival Alani of Idoani, a person said by some to have no royal blood. Recent times With the return to civilian government in 1999, Aderemi Atewogboye was recognized as the ruler. He continues to perform duties such as intervening in family disputes or cases of violence against women. In April 2009 he led a delegation of several hundred people from the Ose community to protest against delays in ratifying that area's designate for a commissioner in the state government. In 2009 Atewogboye called on the government to improve the roads, which had suffered years of neglect and were impassable at some times of the year.

Biography Albeck was born on September 25, 1921, in Vladivostok, Russia. His father was a Danish executive with a shipping firm, while his mother was a Russian escaping the Bolshevik Revolution. His family was taken aboard an American naval vessel to Yokohama, Japan, where Albeck was raised and educated at St. Joseph College. His first connection to the film industry was in 1939, when he became a sales representative for Columbia Pictures in what was then the Dutch East Indies, present day Indonesia. He came to United Artists when the company made the 1951 acquisition of Eagle-Lion Films, the British film company he had been working for.Weber, Bruce. \\"Andy Albeck Is Dead at 89; Headed United Artists\\", The New York Times, October 6, 2010.

Albeck worked his way up through the sales department at United Artists, earning promotions to become president of its broadcasting division and senior vice president of operations. In 1978, Transamerica Corporation chose him to head the studio after its former chairman Arthur B. Krim left with a group of executives to form Orion Pictures, picking Albeck for his ability to control costs and his positive relationship with wary Transamerica executives. Author Steven Bach, who served as head of production at United Artists under Albeck, wrote, \\"Andy Albeck was not show business; that much was clear,\\" in his book Final Cut. During his tenure at United Artists, the studio produced The French Lieutenant's Woman starring Meryl Streep, Manhattan and Stardust Memories by director Woody Allen and the James Bond films Moonraker and For Your Eyes Only. Albeck also oversaw two films in the Rocky series, both of which were box office successes. Raging Bull, with Robert De Niro playing the role of Jake LaMotta, was a critical success that went on to be ranked on the American Film Institute's top 100 films of all time. Albeck's undoing was the film Heaven's Gate, which went several times over its original budget and earned little in box office revenue in the wake of overwhelmingly negative reviews, such as by Vincent Canby of The New York Times, who called the film \\"an unqualified disaster\\" when it was released in November 1980. In the following weeks Albeck was named chairman of United Artists and removed from his post as president, resigning from the firm in February 1981 in the wake of media reports that he had been forced to retire. In the wake of losses amounting to $44 million, making it what was then the biggest money losing film in history, the studio was purchased in May 1981 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from Transamerica to form MGM/UA in a deal valued at $380 million.Harris, Kathryn. \\"Film's Loss May Hit $44 Million: 'Heaven's Gate' Expected to Be Epic Studio Loser\\", Los Angeles Times, June 17, 1981.

As coworkers, Deborah became acquainted with American Saber Champion and 1984 Olympic Bronze medalist Peter Westbrook. Having recently created the Peter Westbrook Foundation, Westbrook invited Benjamin to participate in his Saturday Fencing Program to be taught by himself and other fencing Olympians. Benjamin gravitated to the sport almost instantly. \\"I was immediately intoxicated by the sport and was amazed by the way fencers moved and looked on the strip. It was an incredible experience to be taught by people who went to the Olympic Games. At that time, a goal like that wasn't even fathomable for me. I just mimicked the teachers I would see fencing and I would practice footwork drills that they gave me in the basement of my house.

FriendsWithYou's mission coincides with their motto \\"Magic, Luck, and Friendship.\\" The collaborative began by creating soft sculptures as a means to spread more accessible art like plush and wood toys, as well as immersive art installations, fine art works including sculpture and painting, and are best known for their public art spectacles such as large- scale art installations, playgrounds, and performance pieces. They have described the creation of their art as a healing process intended to increase relatability and connection to each other and the world around them. To date, they have become internationally recognized with public exhibits and artworks in Europe, Asia, Australia, and The Americas. FriendsWithYou Fine Art has been exhibited and/or included in the permanent collections of Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA), Haus der Kulturen der Welt Museum Berlin, and Galerie Emmanuel Perrotin among others. In October 2006, the German art press Die Gestalten Verlag published a FriendsWithYou monograph titled Friends With You Have Powers! Artwork and installations FriendsWithYou have explained that their art is meant to \\"activate the social interaction of people as exploded and refracted by the Internet and elaborate new modes of interpersonal relationships.\\" They use play as an artistic means to foster these relationships. Many FriendsWithYou works look like toys because they are meant for play as a means of interactive unstructured free association. FWY hopes that \\"through their artwork, the buried, neglected urges and yearnings that a seasoned art viewer may not expect to have activated; playfulness, laughter and inquisitiveness are triggered, with an end result of feeling connected.\\" FWY inverts the practice and usage of religious traditions, symbols, and spiritual practices through play to open a connection to the divine. Conceptually, FriendsWithYou's experiential artwork is in conversation with Relational Aesthetics and the work of Jeff Koons, Takashi Murakami, and Damien Hirst. The collective has been compared to Takashi Murakami for their \\"superflat\\" approach to art. =Solo shows= Inner Vision in Between was featured at the MCLEMOI Gallery in Sydney, Australia from February 15 to April 11, 2013. The exhibition themes ran from the playful to the spiritual. It was also described as a minimal, peaceful, stoic and occasionally foreboding journey from one chapter to another. In The Beginning, featured at the Colette in Paris from August 29 to September 24, 2011. It consisted of bronze sculptures, a series of prints, including two exclusive edition prints solely for Colette, an animation video piece and limited run products, in addition to limited edition inflatable Malfi heads and Rainbow Mr. TTT bop bags. 'Happy Rainbow, installed at the Tuen Mun Town Plaza, in Hong Kong from July 22 to September 2, 2012, was a colorful interactive bounce house which also featured fiberglass, plush and resin sculpture installations. FWY designed the installation as a modern shrine which also embodies their themes of play and spirituality. \\"FWY hopes to evoke a spiritual connectivity that will enlighten all visitors. Each piece in the exhibition is charged with so much color and power that it brings great harmony to all who look upon it,\\" the group wrote. :) at the Hole from June 10 to August 6, 2011 was FriendsWithYou's first solo exhibition in New York and the inaugural show at the Hole's new location. The show featured 22 FriendsWithYou artworks including a series of anthropomorphic figures created largely out of geometric abstractions made from Lasercut MDF, car paint and acrylic. The show was described as \\"relentlessly cheerful,\\" and ‚Äúan interactive, experiential wonderland of pop-straction and participation.‚Äù Much like Murakami, Arturo Herrera, Yayoi Kusama, and others FWY take a spiritual and serene approach to form and figure in the :) exhibition. The artists consider these works to be part of the ‚Äúservice art‚Äù movement, allowing for the viewer to easily understand their message and not be categorized as ‚Äúpretentious art‚Äù. FWY feels art is for everyone and can aid in connecting humankind. Inner Space, The Secrets of the Unknown featured bright wooden sculptures, introspective metal beings and FriendsWithYou's signature inflatable artwork. The installation ran at The Hole NYC annex in Miami from December 1, 2011, to January 28, 2012. FWY explained that ‚Äúthe pieces on display are figurative self reflective treasures, levitating in a space continuum, revealing something otherwise inaccessible.\\" Building Blocks, featured at Art Basel in Miami from December 2, 2010, to January 8, 2011, featured FriendsWithYou's trademark playful inflatables as well as prints. The installation consisted of paintings created over the course of a decade. The paintings were meant to be flat extensions of FriendsWithYou's existing sculptural, graphical and experiential installation works and were created to allow or encourage viewers to project their own emotions onto.. The pieces were presented alongside the series of paintings, FWY exhibited select sculptural pieces, meant to illustrate the progression between their installation and the ‚Äúportraiture.‚Äù Rainbow City was an interactive installation containing minimalist inflatable forms from 8' to 50' borrowing their aesthetics from toy-like geometries and designs. Originally commissioned in 2010 by the Luminato Arts Foundation in Toronto, Canada, Rainbow City was then exhibited at Art Basel Miami 2010 presented by Paper Magazine, Pharrell Williams, and Aol. About 20,000 people visited the installation and were able to participate by bouncing about inside the inflatable structures and wandering in and around the surreal landscape. On June 6, 2010, to open section 2 of the High Line in New York City, a collection of 40 air-filled sculptures filled 16,000 square feet of outdoor space in Chelsea. It was FWY's first large scale interactive installation in New York City. According to the artists, Rainbow City was created to allow the viewer to reinterpret spirituality. The large totems represented self-reflective portraits, in line with FWY's goal of evoking visitors to see their emotions and own self within the sculptural pieces. Visitors were encouraged to come and ‚Äúbe in awe of these large, reduced shaped and simple totems,‚Äù stated Arturo Sandoval III. By evoking play through very simple form, FriendsWithYou feels an almost religious scenario of connectivity is created in this interactive installation. The Fun House, described as \\"a giant, anthropomorphic bounce house intended to help unleash the visitors‚Äô inner brats and in doing so, take advantage of the healing power of fun,\\" was originally commissioned by 944 magazine and the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas in 2008. It grew as the installation traveled around the world. As a part of Art Basel Miami 2008 FriendsWithYou was the main featured artist at the Scope Art Fair. Their Fun House installation (December 3rd to December 7th) featured a large bounce house with a smiling face design, filled with inflatable balls, a bounce house, a romper room, restaurant, and a FWY store and fine art gallery. It was also installed at the Welt Museum in Berlin from March 19th to May 3rd, 2009. and the Nada Art Fair, New York. Dream Maker was an installation of rotating spherical objects with faces similar to a miniature solar system. It was up at the Indianapolis Museum of Art from May 2, 2008, to November 9, 2008. Rainbow Valley is a playground designed by FriendsWithYou located at the Aventura Mall in Miami. It was commissioned as a part of the mall‚Äôs ‚ÄúTurnberry for the Arts‚Äù program, which was founded to help promote the arts by ‚Äúdisplaying world class artwork created by both celebrated contemporary artists and talented local artists in Aventura and the surrounding Miami area.‚Äù Other artists in the collection include: Daniel Arsham, Louise Bourgeois, Julian Opie, Tom Otterness, Gary Hume, Lawrence Weiner and Jorge Pardo It opened on December 21, 2006, and was their first permanent installation. The playground has rainbow bridges, slides, a control center, crawl-in mountains in bright colors and the entire area is foam-covered. The installation was meant to foster creativity in children through its interactivity though a storyline of a small mountain, who loses his family, on a search for other mountains to play with. \\"The playground will guide children through Peeko, the baby mountain, and his adventure with Cloudy, his new found friend, to the magical Rainbow Valley.\\" Wired described it as \\"a warped Mario Bros. level\\" 'Cloud City'Cloud City opened in 2005 at the MOCA warehouse during the annual Art Basel in Miami. It was set up as an interactive playground composed of geometric shapes such inflatable spheres, padded 10 foot cones on casters, and pillowed cylinders. The oversized geometric forms and colors invited participation on the part of the viewers in Cloud City, \\"an adventurous dream world playground designed to reinvigorate audiences with childlike energy and optimism.\\" Several of the objects replicated the facial design of their character The boy. The central figure in this installation, The boy is an archetype that embodies youth and na√Øve creation.). With the start of Cloud City FriendsWithYou also released a CD music album of the same name featuring music artists such as PonPoko, Phoenicia, Otto VaN Shirach, and Sam. Cloudy is a video installation that launched exclusively on \\"'Pharrell Williams'\\"'s \\"'i am OTHER'\\" \\"'YouTube'\\" channel. \\"Cloudy\\" is a short by artists Samuel Borkson and Arturo Sandoval III. The animated piece is an exploration into the clouds; a sweet, visual soundscape that takes the viewer through a personal journey into the sky. It invites viewers to follow a cast of clouds and raindrops through an entrancing adventure. FriendsWithYou explores animism, giving the main cast of characters a soul. The purpose of the piece is to transcend the viewer to a peaceful and joyous state. Clouds singing and performing their duties in a joyful manner show us that everything in our world has a role and a purpose. Skywalkers Parade was commissioned by Scion and was a collaboration with other artists such as Ara Peterson, Misaki Kawai, MumbleBoy, Paper Rad, David Choe, and DEVILROBOTS. It consisted of a number of balloons sizing from 5 feet to 60 feet and premiered on December 7, 2006 during Art Basel Miami. FWY conceived the Skywalkers Parade as ‚Äúa collaborative way to tell a beautiful story through an enchanted parade in the sky. Get Lucky was an installation located in the Miami based art space The Box which ran from August 28th to September 25th, 2004. It featured six different altars, with a focus on pyramid, conical, or triangular shapes, covering different aspects of human life and death. The Fur Liaison was a furry monster character who accompanied guests around the installation. The Installation aimed to be an \\"adventure into a modern ritual that empowers us to realize the significant effect we can pose on the world and a chance to alter it to a more balanced state to achieve happiness.\\" (It also was featured at the Merry Karnowsky Gallery in Los Angeles November 20, 2004 from January 15, 2005.)

The show aired at 8pm Plot The story narrates the tale of two coming-of-age lovers, Aarohi and Arjun. Aarohi Ahluwalia belongs to a large Punjabi family of police officers from her grandfather - Daddu, to her uncles, while her father is a lawyer. She is extremely pampered. Arjun Singhania, on the other hand, is an orphan adopted by Rudra Singhania, a renowned Don, who trains him as his son, to be his henchman in the criminal underworld. Arjun kidnaps Aarohi under his father's orders, only for them to fall in love with each other while he keeps her captive, and also protects her from his own enemies in an encounter. However, her family soon finds her and Arjun's identity is disclosed. Feeling betrayed, Aarohi agrees to marry a silly NRI boy Cheeku. Arjun tries his best to get his criminal records cleared and win Aarohi's approval. After her grandfather grants him a clean chit, his sister - who is pregnant - goes to the Ahluwalia house to convince Aarohi, but is pushed off the stairs by her jealous best friend Gauri, who is also in love with Arjun. The Singhanias blame the Ahluwalias for their daughter's miscarriage, and in an act of revenge, Arjun marries Aarohi and leaves her in the pandal, only for her to walk into the Singhania house and live with him as his wife, welcomed only by his grandmother, who is good friends with Aarohi's grandparents. Gradually, they begin to fall in love again amidst their several fights. As Aarohi returns to her maternal house, it comes to light that Aarohi's grandfather committed a mistake which caused Arjun's mother's death. Arjun goes to kill Daddu in a fit of rage, but is emotionally stopped by Aarohi. On the other side, Mikhail, the Singhania's eldest son, who is jealous of the attention Arjun receives from their father, shoots Daddu, and Arjun is arrested. Aarohi tries to prove Arjun innocent, and later helps him escape, but is herself locked up by her uncles. Soon, Daddu wakes up and testifies for Arjun, and they are released. They visit Arjun's maternal home, but Mikhail reaches there and tries to kill Arjun. Aarohi's uncles also reach the location, arrest him, and save them. Arjun and Aarohi are finally united, and get married with the blessings of the entire family.

It was first published in a 1937 issue of Redbook. Plot summary The novella tells the story of an Asheville, North Carolina family that suffers the loss of Grover, the 12-year-old son, who dies of typhoid fever during an extended family visit to the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. The story is composed of four parts. Part 1, written in third person, presents Grover's perception of a childhood epiphany experienced months before the family moves from North Carolina to St. Louis. Cheated and accused of stealing by a candy-store owner, the boy seeks out his father, who returns with him to the store and extracts retribution, leaving the boy with a restored sense of self but a deeper understanding of life's darker side. In Part 2, some 30 years after the boy's death, the still-grieving mother reflects on her \\"best\\" son and recounts the high excitement of the train trip to the Fair and the son's amazing maturity. Throughout her narrative, the mother exemplifies life's irreparable wounding. In Part 3, also 30 years later, the older sister tells of an adventure at the Fair when she and the boy, youngsters in a strange place, sneak into downtown St. Louis and eat in a cheap restaurant. Upon their return home, the boy becomes ill with the onset of typhoid fever. In the sister's story we confront not only her long- sustained grief and guilt, but her vision of the incomprehensibility of life: \\"How is it,\\" she asks, \\"that nothing turns out the way we thought it would be.\\" In Part 4, Eugene, the younger brother who has in the 30 intervening years become a famous writer, narrates his return to the house in St. Louis where the family had lived and the boy had died. Eugene hopes to recapture and recreate in fiction the essence of the boy, a hope not fulfilled, as the title of the story suggests. Instead, the writer-brother comes to see the limits of time and memory in recapturing the past, which marks a significant epiphany for him and a redirection of his work as writer. References * .

Career  In 1996, he began his career in the public sector as Private Secretary and Advisor to the General Director of Treasury Planning at the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP). In 2000, he began serving in the private sector as an Associate Consultant at ADP/Mercer Management Consulting and later, in 2001, as Vice President of the global PR firm Hill+Knowlton Mexico where he contributed to design and implement various communication and promotion programs for corporations and products of the pharmaceutical, financial and telecommunications industry; he also had a relationship with the media and investors for whom he designed and implemented lobbying campaigns . In 2002, Karam rejoined the public service as Coordinator of Advisors of the Incorporation and Collection Office at the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS), and in 2004 served as Coordinator of Taxation of the IMSS . During the Mexican presidential campaigns in 2006, Karam participated as an advisor on proposals and speech for the PAN's candidate and eventual president Felipe Calder√≥n Hinojosa. Later, he was responsible for the health and social security projects in the transition team of the President-elect . Once the Calderon's Administration began, he was appointed as CFO of the Mexican Social Security Institute. Subsequently, he served as the National Commissioner of Social Protection in Health . In March 2009, President Felipe Calder√≥n Hinojosa appointed him as Managing Director of the IMSS in replacement of Juan Francisco Molinar Horcasitas . In 2015, Hill+Knowlton Strategies named Karam President and Managing Director of H+K Mexico, as well as Latin America Public Affairs Practice Lead, as part of a strategic movement to identify key sectors in development .  Influenza  In April 2015, as head of the IMSS, he had to face the outbreak of influenza, the H1N1 virus that for several days paralyzed the country's economy. Together with President Calder√≥n and the head of the Ministry of Health, he took measures to prevent the spread of this virus, such as the cancellation of classes, mass events and the closure of restaurants. All this experience allowed him to participate in May 2015 as coauthor of the book The Mexican influenza and the pandemic that is coming next to Jos√© Luis Romo, Juan Lozano, Mauricio Ortiz, Roberto Albiztegui and Santiago Echevarr√≠a Zuno, published by Siglo XXI, in which he describes his experience at the head of the IMSS during the emergence of the virus, the management of the information, the coordination of health services and the decision-making for their combat.  The ABC day care case  On June 5, 2009 the ABC day-care center in Hermosillo , Sonora caught fire, causing the death of 49 children. The tragic event prompted the parents of the victims to demand from the IMSS the clarification of the facts as it is a child care center subrogated by the Institute. As head of the IMSS, Daniel Karam was in charge of leading the dialogue roundtables and following up the investigation. In early 2010, he was blame by members of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation as a possible responsible for the fire at the ABC day-care center and although he was exonerated, three judges of the Supreme Court considered that his conduct in the case was incorrect. Karam was summoned to several appearances in the Mexico's Congress to clarify the responsibility of those involved and the name of the owners of the day-care center concerned. Upon his departure from the IMSS, Daniel Karam assured that he left an orderly Institute, walking and with well-diagnosed challenges.

Established in 1916, the school provides instruction at two of the school's three campuses in the New York City area‚Äî at the university's main campus, Rose Hill, located in the Bronx; and the Lincoln Center, located in Manhattan's Upper West Side. The school offers a wide range of master's programs, doctoral degree programs, and certificates in traditional disciplines in liberal arts and sciences, as well as interdisciplinary programs. The school stresses the advantage of its multiple identities: a graduate school of arts and sciences, a Catholic university, a Jesuit institution, and a school in New York City. History The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences was established at Fordham University in 1916, as well as a teachers college. Originally, the GSAS was housed in the Woolworth Building in Manhattan, and offered only eight courses, mainly anchored around philosophy and literature. The school was led by three Jesuits; Michael J. Mahoney, J.F.X. Murphy, and Terence J. Shealy; as well as one lay instructor, Cond√© B. Pallen. By 1920, the school employed a total of sixteen faculty members, and offered Master of Arts, Master of Science, Master of Philosophy, Licentiate of Philosophy, and Doctoral degrees. In 1921, the GSAS was reorganized into the modern departmental system it bears today. In 1933, a psychology department was introduced into the GSAS In 1936, upon the completion of Keating Hall, the GSAS administrative headquarters were officially relocated to Keating. The same year, Hilaire Belloc joined the faculty, followed by Dietrich von Hildebrand in 1940, the latter of whom taught philosophy. Psychologist Anne Anastasi joined the faculty of the psychology department in 1947, and was the fourth woman to join the Fordham GSAS faculty. In 1967, Dr. Arthur Wayne Brown, a scholar in English literature, became the dean of the GSAS, and established two new Masters programs, in International Political Economy and Development, and Medieval Studies, the former of which would later be inaugurated in the political science department. After the September 11th attacks, Professor Orlando Rodr√≠guez‚Äîthe chair of the department of sociology, whose son died in the World Trade Center‚Äîbegan teaching a graduate course on the history of terrorism at the GSAS. In 2008, the Fordham GSAS was selected by the United Nations for membership in its Academic Impact Initiative. Two years later, the university completed construction on a residential cabin for biology graduate students at the Louis Calder Center in Armonk, New York.  Academics  Fordham Graduate School of Arts and Sciences currently offers 24 Master's programs, ten Doctoral programs, and nine Advanced Certificates in various disciplines.  Campus  Fordham GSAS is primarily located on Fordham's Rose Hill campus, headquartered in Keating Hall, though some classes are offered at the Lincoln Center campus. Students are offered university housing near campus, but most graduate students find off-campus housing on their own. Reputation and rankings Fordham's various graduate programs have also been ranked by the U.S. News & World Report: In 2017, the graduate program of Education was named the 45th best in the United States; its English graduate program was ranked 51st in the nation, while its history and sociology programs were ranked no. 79 and 102, respectively. The graduate program in social work was ranked the 22nd best social work program in the United States, while the university's clinical psychology and psychology programs ranked no. 74 and 141, respectively.

Murder Stoffels, a 17-year-old schoolgirl, was found in a riverbed near Dawid Bezuidenhout High School after having been raped and murdered. Later that same day, a police officer found, a man, named Junias Fillipus (32), washing clothes in the same riverbed. The distance was approximately 300 to 500 metres from where Stoffels' body was found. After observing what he believed to be scratch marks on his knees and back and blood stains on the clothes, the police officer arrested Fillipus in connection with the attack. Aftermath The crime was described by The Namibian as among \\"most prominent cases of violence against women and children recorded in [Namibia] in 2010\\". The Windhoek Observer noted that \\"Fillipus‚Äô arrest sparked a public outcry against gender-based violence\\". Approximately 3,000 people, including schoolchildren from 10 schools, marched from Stoffels' school to the Magistrates' Court in Katutura to protest her rape and murder and to deliver a petition to the Deputy Prosecutor General, Johnny Truter, which pointed out the high rate of violent crime on Namibian children. The Southern Times reported that the murder of Stoffels \\"ignited debate on the reinstatement of the death penalty\\" in Namibia. Evaluation of forensic evidence lasted almost a year. The results did not link Fillipus with the crime, and the charges against him were withdrawn. In May 2011, he was released from custody. Fillipus sued the Namibian Police for unlawful arrest, unlawful detention, and malicious prosecution in 2013. In 2016 the first two charges were thrown out of the Windhoek High Court due to a one-year statute of limitations for such claims. The third claim is yet to be heard in court. Meanwhile, investigators fear that the case has gone cold. In 2013 a pedestrian bridge in Windhoek's Khomasdal suburb was named after Magdalena Stoffels. It is situated close to the Dawid Bezuidenhout school where Stoffels was a learner, and it crosses the Arebbusch Riverbed in which the murder occurred. The bridge is hoped to prevent future crimes in the bushy riverbed.

The mission is to promote permaculture for the development of a healthier, wiser and more ecologically sustainable society. IPES started small. Relying on volunteers and small donations, it taught ecological farming to small groups of farmers in a handful of communities. Over the past years, they have expanded enormously to meet the rapidly growing demand from poor rural communities for ways of sustainable living and farming. IPES now teaches subsistence farming families to improve their environment and adapt to climate change, supporting their self sufficiency and food security by implementing sustainable agriculture practices. IPES strengthens community organisation and supports ecological community development, training community leaders in permaculture and promoting the active participation of women and young people in the ecological development of their communities.

The store was built in 1914, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. History The Bozeman Trail crossed the Powder River at several points in the area around Sussex, Wyoming. Because of the river crossing, Fort Reno and Cantonment Reno were established in the 1800s near Sussex. Fort Reno, located eight miles downstream (northeast) from Sussex on the Powder River, was built in 1865 as one in a series of military posts to protect travelers on the Bozeman Trail. The fort was abandoned in 1868 and burned, reportedly by Indians. In 1877, Cantonment Reno, five miles downstream from Sussex, was established as a supply depot for the Powder River Campaign of 1876. In 1878, the cantonment was closed, and the soldiers relocated to Fort McKinney near Buffalo, Wyoming. After the soldiers left, a few civilians remained across the Power River from the cantonment, and they established a settlement known as Powder River Station-Powder River Crossing. By 1880, this community of 49 people included a stage station, a hotel, a general store, and a post office. In the early 1880s, Henry Winter (\\"Hard Winter\\") Davis, established the Spectacle Ranch near the present site of Sussex. The post office at Powder River Station-Powder River Crossing moved to the Davis ranch in 1893 or 1894. The active freight route along the Bozeman Trail that connected the military outposts between Cheyenne and Buffalo developed into roads, and Sussex became a stop along the way. Morris Leitner, known as the \\"Sage of Sussex\\", came to Sussex around 1900. He built his home at the Sussex river crossing, and became postmaster, and ran a store from his home. Leitner also taught school, served as justice of the peace, notary public, and county assessor. After some years, he was appointed to the State Board of Equalization, and he moved to Cheyenne in 1938. A steel bridge, the EDZ Irigary Bridge, was built over the Powder River at Sussex in 1914. From 1912 to about 1920, Sussex was on the route of the Black and Yellow Trail which went from Chicago to the Black Hills and Yellowstone National Park. In 1914, the same year the bridge was completed, Leitner erected a new building to house the post office, store, and dance hall. This building became known as the Sussex Community Hall. Building The Sussex Community Hall is a one-story, wood-framed building that measures 86 feet long and 26 feet wide. It rests on a concrete foundation and has an unfinished basement. The original siding remains, and corrugated sheet metal covers the asphalt-shingled roof. A stove pipe protrudes through the roof on the southeast slope. The long rectangular building is unadorned except for simple knee braces and brackets under the wide overhanging eaves, corner boards, and plain window surrounds. The building was originally constructed in 1914 as a combination grocery store/post office/dance hall housed in one large room. The store and post office were located at the east end of the building and the dance hall on the west end. In the late 1920s, the store and post office moved to a renovated garage east of the present building, and the entire room became devoted to a dance hall/community center. The dance hall included a stage on the north wall and a small band stand on the west wall. The stage was often used for school Christmas pageants and \\"home-talent\\" plays performed by community members. In the early 1950s, the lean-to on the north side where dinners were served collapsed and the floor needed replacing after many years of hard use. The stage was removed and a partially enclosed kitchen erected from which dinners could be both prepared and served. During this same renovation, the front door and all windows were altered and/or added. The outhouse and vestibule received modifications, wood paneling was placed on the interior walls, and a drop ceiling installed. Although the building was also electrified around this time, it still lacks indoor plumbing today. Current Status The Sussex Community Hall was an active place for many years, hosting such varied activities as Halloween, Christmas and Thanksgiving suppers, Mother-Daughter banquets; \\"harvest suppers\\"; wedding receptions; picnics and barbecues; home-talent plays; school programs, and annual meetings of the Sussex Irrigation Company. The two decades following World War II brought many changes to the community of Sussex. In 1954-1955, a new bridge was built over Powder River about one hundred yards west of Sussex, and the old steel bridge was moved to a ranch downstream. The Sussex Road (Wyoming Highway 192) was paved in 1956. The dilapidated Sussex Hotel burned down in 1962. A large flood of the Powder River in 1962 destroyed the new Sussex store and post office adjacent to the Sussex Community Hall. The post office was relocated to Kaycee, Wyoming in 1963. Use of the old hall fell off with the advent of better roads, more cars, and television which helped create a different type of social interaction than that type provided by community centers. The Sussex Women's Club bought the building from Maude Leitner in the year of the flood (1962), and continued to operate and maintain it until its sale to the Sussex Ditch Company in 1995.

Life Born in County Clare, he was son of Donatus Qu√¶lly. He belonged to a family which ruled Connemara till 1238, when they were conquered by the O'Flaherties. He became a student at the College of Navarre in Paris, and there graduated with a Doctorate of Divinity. He returned to Ireland and was appointed the vicar- apostolic of Killaloe by a papal brief on 30 August 1619. Following the death of Florence Conroy, he was appointed the archbishop of Tuam on 28 June 1630 and consecrated at Galway on 10 October 1630 by Thomas Walsh, archbishop of Cashel, with Richard Arthur, bishop of Limerick, and Boetius Egan, bishop of Elphin, serving as co-consecrators. In 1632 he presided at a council held at Galway to enforce the decrees of the council of Trent in Ireland. He caused the ancient wooden figure of St. Mac Dara in the church of Cruachmic Dara, County Galway, to be buried on the island, probably in consequence of some superstitious proceedings to which it had given rise. His work in Tuam provoked a complaint from Richard Boyle, the Church of Ireland archbishop of Tuam, in 1641. Queally attended the national synod of 1643, by which the Catholic Confederation was organized, and its assembly at Kilkenny in 1645. He was elected to the Supreme Council, and later was appointed President of Connaught. The Papal Nuncio Giovanni Battista Rinuccini planned to meet him and Heber MacMahon upon his arrival in 1645 but he died before this could occur: Pope Innocent X had recommended him by letter to Rinuccini as a man to be trusted. He raised a body of fighting men in Galway and Mayo, and joined the forces of Sir James Dillon, near Ballysadare, County Sligo. They aimed to recover Sligo from the Scottish Covenanters. On Sunday, 26 October 1645, Viscount Taafe and Dillon dined with Queally, and while they were dining the Irish forces were attacked by Sir Charles Coote, Sir William Cole, and Sir Francis Hamilton, and put to flight. The archbishop's secretary, Tadhg O'Connell, was killed trying to save his master, and the archbishop himself was first wounded by a pistol-shot, and then cut down. The Earl of Glamorgan's agreement with the Confederate Catholics and a letter from Charles I of England were found in his pocket. The English Parliament published the correspondence to prejudice both parties, Catholic and royalist. Walter Lynch on the Irish side gave ¬£30 for his body, which was carried to Tuam. It was reburied some time later by Brigit, Lady Athenry, but the tomb is no longer known. Dr. Edmund Meara wrote an epitaph for him in Latin verse, but failed to discover his burial-place. Works He wrote an account of the Aran Islands, printed in Colgan's Acta Sanctorum Hiberni√¶ (p. 714), and is translated in James Hardiman's edition of Roderic O'Flaherty's Description of West Connaught.

Alley Cat Allies' emphasis is on stray and feral cat advocacy and providing information on trap‚Äìneuter‚Äìreturn, the method of managing feral cat populations that the organization considers humane and effective. The organization helps communities, individuals and grassroots groups launch or improve their Trap-Neuter-Return programs and expand affordable spay and neuter services. Alley Cat Allies also educates the public about the number of cats killed annually in animal shelters and works to reform the shelter system to better serve the needs of feral cats. Founding Alley Cat Allies was founded in 1990, by Becky Robinson and Louise Holton after they discovered an alley with 56 cats and two smaller colonies in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington, D.C.. They neutered the cats using the trap-neuter-return method. Deluged by requests for help with similar work, and aware of the lack of resources and information on the method, they formed a network for feral cats. Holton left the organization in 2001 to form Alley Cat Rescue. Robinson serves as the organization's president, running the organization with Chief Operating Officer Charlene Pedrolie. Former Vice President and Board Chair Donna Wilcox joined as full- time staff in 1999 and left the organization in 2018.

It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1983. In 2020 it was included as a contributing property in the Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District. History In 1860, Dr. Phillip Worley built a residence for his family in the 400 block of Brady Street. At the same time, he built the one-story structure that is attached to the north side of the house to serve as his office. It is now a garage. His son, Dr. H.A. Worley, later lived and practiced medicine here until 1882 when his other son Charles Worley lived in this house and operated a stable in the building to the north. with By 1910 the Worley family no longer lived in the residence and it was being used as a boarding house. It is a rare example of a mid-19th century single-family house in the downtown area. The house and former stable are now used as living space. The neighboring Hibernia Hall building is now used for commercial space and residential apartments. At one time they all housed an antique store. Architecture The Worley House is a two-story, Greek Revival, brick structure that was built on what is likely a stone foundation. The Greek revival elements, which is why this residence is considered significant, include a boxy form, side-gable roofline, elongated first story windows, and hipped porch roof. The home also features an off- center front entrance and two windows on the first floor. There are three windows on the second floor that line up with the openings of the first. Wood shutters frame the sides of all the windows.

The film is adapted from Stanley Houghton's 1912 stage play of the same name, which had previously been filmed twice as a silent in 1918 and 1927. Saville had been the producer on the highly regarded 1927 version directed by Maurice Elvey. Both Stuart and Norman McKinnel returned in 1931 to reprise their roles from the 1927 film.Hindle Wakes (1931) Moat, Janet. BFI Screen Online. Retrieved 06-10-2010 Saville kept the plot faithful to its source material, making the film essentially a sound retread of the earlier silent versions, with only a small number of minor cosmetic adjustments (for example the name of the lead character is changed from Fanny to Jenny, and the fatal accident here results from a bus crash rather than a drowning). Plot Lancashire mill-girls Jenny Hawthorne (Chrystall) and Mary Hollins (Ruth Peterson) go on holiday to Blackpool during the annual wakes week in their hometown of Hindle. They run into Alan Jeffcote (Stuart), the son of the owner of the mill in which they work, who has also traveled to Blackpool with a group of friends while his fianc√©e is detained on business in London. Jenny and Alan hit it off immediately, and he persuades her to leave Blackpool to spend the week with him at Llandudno in North Wales. To cover her tracks, Jenny leaves a postcard with Mary, asking her to send it to her parents (Edmund Gwenn and Sybil Thorndike) later in the week. She and Alan leave their friends and set off for Wales. Shortly afterwards, Mary is involved in a serious road accident and is killed. Her possessions are returned to Hindle and the unmailed postcard is found in her luggage. Jenny's parents are already suspicious and concerned by the fact that Jenny has not returned to Hindle as they would have expected in view of such a tragic turn to her holiday, and the discovery of the postcard increases their fears. Jenny returns at the end of the week. Her parents ask about her holiday, and allow her to dig a hole for herself as her fictitious account shows she is unaware of Mary's death and has clearly not spent the week in Blackpool. When confronted with the truth, Jenny admits to where she has been, and with whom, and defiantly refuses to be made to feel guilty or immoral. The Hawthornes decide that they will have to confront the Jeffcotes (McKinnel and Mary Clare) with their son's unacceptable behaviour. Mrs. Hawthorne's anger is tempered by the fact that she believes the situation may be turned to financial advantage. Hawthorne feels some trepidation, as he and Jeffcote have been friends since childhood and have remained on good terms despite Jeffcote's rise to social prominence. To the surprise of the Hawthornes, Jeffcote agrees that in the circumstances Alan must be made to marry Jenny to prevent a scandal. Mrs. Jeffcote is less convinced, anticipating the ruin of Alan's reputation and business prospects. A meeting is convened between all the interested parties. Jenny and Alan remain silent while their parents try to thrash out suitable arrangements, and Mrs. Hawthorne and Mrs. Jeffcote become involved in an undignified shouting match. Jenny and Alan leave to talk alone. She tells him that she has no designs on his money and has no interest in marrying him. She then announces her decision to the incredulous parents, adding that Alan was no more to blame than she was, for both of them it was just a \\"little fling\\" about which neither need feel guilty, and that a woman has just as much right as a man to enjoy a brief sexual flirtation with no strings attached. Alan returns to his fianc√©e, while Jenny confidently leaves home and her mother's fury for an independent life without interference.

The organization has sub-chapters in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Texas and Washington. The group also has jurisdiction over the King James Grand Lodge of Oregon AF&AM.; History African American Freemasonry originated in the early nineteenth century, at a time when it was extremely rare for African-Americans to be admitted into mainstream (predominantly white) Masonic Lodges in the United States (a state of affairs that only began to change in the late twentieth century). African-American Freemasonry has been somewhat chaotic, prone to disharmony and schisms. Today, it is common for multiple, rival, African-American Grand Lodges to exist in the same State, each declaring the others illegitimate and irregular. The Sons of Haiti were formally founded in 1962 after a preceding period when the organization was involved with lawsuits against other African American Masonic organizations in Washington. Following its founding, the organization was recognized by the Grand Lodges of Haiti, The Grande Loge de France, and a Mexican Grand Lodge. (35 page pamphlet accessible 10/2010 via button \\"The Most Worshipful Sons of Haiti\\", author and date at end) Prince Hall Freemasonry's Phylaxis Society describes the Sons of Haiti as \\"bogus\\" for not having descended from African Lodge Number 459 or the United Grand Lodges of England, Ireland, or Scotland. Sons of Haiti are not considered a legitimate body of Freemasonry by any regular Masonic body. The Supreme Council of the Sons of Haiti Lodge is located in Renton, Washington. The Renton City Council \\"recognized August 11, 2010 as Sons of Haiti Supreme Council Day\\". Before moving to Renton, the Supreme Council operated out of Washington Hall in Seattle, which they purchased in 1973. They rented the auditorium to various community groups, which used the rented space for concerts and other public gatherings. The building was sold in 2009 to Historic Seattle for $1.5 million. The organization has held annual Supreme Council planning and session events from 1983 to 2006 in locations ranging from Oakland, California to Nassau in the Bahamas.

It is located on the east side of Brady Street, near the middle of the block. The Hibernian Hall was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.In 2020 it was included as contributing property in the Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District. History Entrance sign Irish immigration into the city of Davenport started with the Irish Famines from 1845 to 1849 and religious persecution in Ireland, which was all under British rule at the time. The Irish numbered 1,961 people in Davenport in 1858. They generally, but not exclusively, resided on the east side of town in and around the area known as Cork Hill. For the most part, the Irish immigrants who came to Davenport were laborers who worked in such industries as river men, railroads, telegraph building, and in the areas flour and saw mills. Like the Germans, Davenport's other large ethnic group, the Irish formed fraternal organizations. The Fenian Society was the first such group to form in 1864. Largely, the group provided their homeland with military, moral, and economic support. Eventually, interest declined and it was replaced in 1881 with the Irish National Land League of America. That organization was replaced three years later with the Ancient Order of Hibernians. In 1885 the Iowa Hibernians held their convention in Davenport. The Hibernians purchased the property on Brady Street in the late 1880s or early 1890s. An 1886 Sanborn Fire Insurance map shows a Christian Chapel on the site that would become the Hibernia Hall. It was a two-story building with a deep setback from Brady Street. By the 1892 Sanborn map, the same structure was known as Hibernian Hall. The building dates from about 1855. The Hibernians remained active at this location until 1937. The Catholic Messenger, an independent Catholic newspaper that was acquired by the Diocese of Davenport during the Great Depression, operated from here for forty years. The building was converted to retail space on the main level and office space on the upper floors. The structure suffered fire damage in 1951 that resulted in some remodeling. The building housed Riverbend Antiques from the early 1970s. Its proprietor, Ron Bellomy, owned the building. Bellomy sold the Hibernian Hall in early 2014 to local developers Manoj and Manisha Baheti who plan to turn it and six adjacent buildings into loft apartments. Architecture The c. 1855 church. Davenport architect Frederick G. Clausen designed the front section for the Hibernian's in January 1891. It was built by Struck & Jaeger. The original church sanctuary wth a with two-story gabled house-style structure attached to it is intact at the rear of the building. The Hibernian Hall is a three-story brick building. The foundation in the front is most likely constructed partially of brick and the original building's foundation in the back is likely stone. The building suggests the Richardsonian Romanesque style found in the vertical grouping of windows within round-arched arcades and the general sense of mass and weight. The building also features wide piers with plinth-like capitals. The Hibernian Hall is a double-wide storefront with a central projecting pavilion. A gabled parapet and decorative pinnacles top the pavilion. The entrance to the upper floors of the building is found in a turned brick arch in the center pavilion. Above the entrance is an ornate grill that contains the building's name, ‚ÄúHibernian Hall‚Äù. The oversized windows of the building's upper stories are now reduced in size by infill. The exterior walls between the windows of the second and third story features decorative brickwork. A corbelled cornice is found across the top of the building. with See also *List of Hibernian buildings References External links Religious buildings and structures completed in 1855 Cultural infrastructure completed in 1891 Romanesque Revival architecture in Iowa Buildings and structures in Davenport, Iowa Clubhouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Hibernian buildings National Register of Historic Places in Davenport, Iowa Individually listed contributing properties to historic districts on the National Register in Iowa Irish-American culture in Iowa Catholic Church in Iowa ","title":"Hibernia Hall"},{"id":"29082329","text":"Patrick Paniter (born c. 1470 - 1519) Scottish churchman and principal secretary to James IV of Scotland and the infant James V. The surname is usually written Paniter, or Painter, or occasionally Panter. Life Paniter was born around 1470 at the village of Newmanswells near Montose. He was educated in Paris. On his return, without taking holy orders, he became Rector of Fetteresso in the Mearns and Vicar of Kilmany in Fife. James IV first made him the teacher of his illegitimate son Alexander Stewart, and shortly afterwards his first secretary. Alexander went to Italy with Erasmus, and Paniter became tutor to the king's brother, the Earl of Moray. As rewards, ecclesiastical titles piled up, and next Paniter became Archdeacon and Chancellor of Dunkeld, then Deacon of Moray in 1509. He exchanged some of these livings to become Rector of Tannadice in Angus in 1510. In 1513 he became Abbot of Cambuskenneth. Paniter hoped to become Preceptor of Torphichen, and Henry VIII of England wrote to Leo X in his favour, but it was not to be.Hay, Denys ed., Letters of James V (HMSO, 1954), p. 17. Paniter held a papal dispensation for holding these church appointments while still not a priest, on account of his duties as royal secretary.Hay, Denys ed., Letters of James V (HMSO, 1954), pp. 58-59. In 1510, Paniter was made Customar General of Scotland. In 1511 James IV wrote to the Pope mentioning that only letters for Scotland with Paniter's countersignature could be trusted. In 1513 he donned armour at the Battle of Flodden and directed the field artillery, even helping to fire the guns. In May 1515 the Duke of Albany identified him as a Douglas supporter and he was imprisoned on the Isle of Inchgarvie. Soon Paniter gained the Duke's confidence and he was included in a diplomatic mission to Paris in July 1517. Paniter fell ill and remained in Paris where he died two years later. David Panter, secretary to Mary, Queen of Scots and John Lesley, Bishop of Ross, was his illegitimate son.Mackie & Spilman ed., The Letters of James IV (Edinburgh, 1953), pp. xxxviii-xxxiv, no. 360. David's mother was Margaret Crichton, an illegitimate daughter of William Crichton, Lord Crichton and Margaret Stewart, James IV's aunt.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1913), p. lxxx. Paniter restored the Hospital of St. Mary in Montrose and was its Preceptor. Carved panels bearing his family heraldry, originally from the Hospital, which were discovered in re-use in a private house in Montrose in the 19th century, are displayed in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.

Following a surprise announcement that the school had become impossible to run partly due to recession, the school ceased operations at the end of the summer term 2014. History =Building= The building which the school occupied, Battenhall Mount, dates back to the Victorian period and was built during the 1860s. It was taken over by Sir Percy Allsopp who extended the building, modeling it after the Italianate style popularised by Prince Albert. His family business went bankrupt and the house was sold off. It was one of many stately mansions used as a convalescent home-cum-hospital during World War I. =School= In between the wars, the house was put on sale.

Marquez has slowed to the point that he almost seems to prefer getting into slugfests where he can still use his excellent counter-punching accuracy, while Katsidis has never been one to turn down a blood-drenched war. Background Lightweight champion Juan Manuel Marquez agreed to fight Michael Katsidis at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on the Las Vegas Strip on Nov. 27. Marquez (51-5-1, 37 KOs) had decisively won a rematch with Juan Diaz on July 31 in his first fight since losing to Floyd Mayweather Jr. in their 2009 bout.http://www.badlefthook.com/2010/9/2/1664796/juan-manuel-marquez-accepts- termshttp://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&id;=31889 After failing to interest Manny Pacquiao in a third fight, Marquez agreed to a mandatory title defense against Michael Katsidis (27-2, 22 KOs), who had revitalized his career with four straight victories following back-to-back losses to Joel Casamayor and Juan Diaz. There was speculation that the fight was going to be postponed because the brother of Katsidis was found dead on October 19, 2010 in his Brisbane, Australia home. Katsidis was out for a run when Smith received a call from Katsidis' mother. She had bad news. Katsidis' older brother, Stathi Katsidis, had been found dead of a possible drug overdose in his Brisbane home by girlfriend Melissa Jackson. Things are back to planned, and he would indeed challenge Marquez, despite the death of his older brother, Stathi Katsidis. After Manny Pacquiao's beating of Antonio Margarito there were many speculated opponents. One that stood out was a rubber match between Marquez and Pacquiao (if he gets through Katsidis). Pacquiao plans to retire before the age of 35, he told a news conference in Manila. He said he was willing to fight Marquez again but that the match would probably not excite fans. \\"I would not watch Pacquiao vs. Marquez,\\" he said. Though Marquez would have to go up to Welterweight (2 weight classes up) to challenge, Pacquiao would outweigh Marquez by no more than around 3 lbs on the night of the fight; Marquez rehydrated to 145 lbs vs. Katsidis, while Pacquiao rehydrated to 148 lbs vs. Margarito. The fight Dinamita successfully defended his WBA and WBO lightweight titles, stopping Katsidis at 2:14 of the ninth round. Katsidis knocked down Marquez with a left hook in the third, but Marquez rallied to take the lead before finishing off Katsidis in the ninth. In the ninth round, Marquez landed 36 punches to nine for Katsidis, Kenny Bayless halted the bout after Katsidis was hurt by several combinations. After eight rounds, the three judges had the 37-year-old Marquez leading, 78-74, 76-75, 77-74.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1983 and on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 1993. It is commonly referred to as the Dillon Fountain. History Dillon bas-relief The structure memorializes John Forrest Dillon who was a Davenport attorney, an Iowa Supreme Court Justice and a judge on the United States Circuit Court. A bequest after his death on May 6, 1914, specified the construction and location of the fountain. with The memorial anchors the south end of Main Street and faces the Civil War Monument twelve blocks to the north on top of the bluff. It was also meant to be a focal point and dramatic terminus for the street, which connects LeClaire Park with Vander Veer Park in central Davenport. Like the Civil War Monument, Main Street surrounded the Dillon Memorial. When the memorial was constructed from 1918 to 1919 there were no other structures on the south side of River Drive. The memorial was part of a major riverfront development program by the Levee Improvement Commission along with Union Station and the W.D. Petersen Memorial Music Pavilion. It was at this time that the name of Riverfront Park was changed to LeClaire Park. In 1922 the Municipal Natatorium was built on the west side of the street from the memorial, and a year later the Lend-A-Hand Club was built to the east. The Lend-a-Hand building was also listed on the NRHP. In the late 20th century the memorial returned to its original state when the other two structures were torn down. Main Street was then closed south of River Drive and the area was incorporated into LeClaire Park in 1997. At that time the brick plaza was built around the fountain. Architecture The Davenport Levee Improvement Commission sponsored a design competition for the memorial. New York artists Franklin and Arthur Ware won the competition and designed the memorial in association with Paul Schultz. The Dillon Memorial is a Neoclassical structure built in concrete. The style is typical of monuments and public buildings that were built at the time. It also reflected Arthur Ware's training at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. The monument is an upright, fluted column surrounded by a circular basin, which functions as a fountain. A lantern sits on top of a platform capital. Bas- relief panels of lion heads and garland swags decorate the base of the column. There is also a bas-relief likeness of Judge Dillon on the column.

It was published on November 22, 2010. It is set on a generation ship that has lost its way under mysterious circumstances.  Plot  A man wakes up from a dream-like state, naked and freezing, with no memory. A little girl leads him through a series of corridors in a generation ship in search of warmth. She calls him Teacher, and together they encounter several other strange beings as they travel through the ship trying to survive and find the answers to their questions. Teacher eventually finds out that he is a clone and has been resurrected several times before, although those versions did not survive. Each clone was able to leave bits of information, a kind of breadcrumb trail for the next iteration. It is from these diaries that Teacher discovers the true nature of his situation. His companions are clones as well, genetically engineered for specific purposes. The ship's crew has separated into two groups, each vying for control of the ship. One faction wants to abandon their mission to colonize a planet which is already teeming with life, while the other wants to press forward. The ship is damaged during one of their battles, and the clones have been created in order to fix it. Teacher, who discovers his real name is Sanjay, eventually reaches the third hull of the book's title where he encounters Mother, who is the leader of the faction that wants to continue to their destination. She tells him she created him to be her ally. In the end, Teacher and his companions flee from Mother and await their arrival on the new planet. Critical reception Chris Hsiang summarizes the overall impact of the book as \\"...less than thrilling but I've come to expect this from Greg Bear: he is often more concerned with the journey than the destination. The Mystery in Space of Hull Zero Three is more personal and at the same time very universal. When you look past all the action and exotic scenery Teacher's turmoil boils down to, 'Who am I and why are we here?' We may never get the full answer but these are the kind of questions we all have to ask.\\" Similarly, the book has been described by Harriet Klausner of Alternative Worlds as a \\"science fiction thriller that adds very little new to the generational ark in space subgenre\\". The Science Fact and Science Fiction Concatenation describes the novel as \\"near-mundane SF in the form of the interstellar space craft and hard SF biology of its occupants whose survival is threatened\\".

The River Camac flows through it and within the grounds of the park there are fishing ponds. A caravan park can be found near the parks N7 entrance. The area, once Corkagh Demesne, contained two large houses, and historically also featured mills.  History  Formerly, the park was known as Corkagh Demesne, on which two large houses stood, and gunpowder mills were run. When Lewis Chaigneau bought Corkagh in the 1720s he leased a portion of the estate to Nicholas Grueber for the establishment of gunpowder mills. Grueber ran the mills from 1716 to 1733. The gunpowder mills on Corkagh Estate, active during the 18th and 19th centuries, were regarded as a nationally important centre for the production of gunpowder and provided employment for many local people. Most of the mill buildings were situated in Kilmatead which adjoins Corkagh. Explosions were common occurrences at gunpowder mills. However an explosion in 1787 was so big that it was felt as far away as the city and caused damage to buildings around Clondalkin. The mill building itself was completely destroyed. The Arabin family ran the mills in the 1790s.The 1787 Explosion at Corkagh Gunpowder Mills Corkagh Park was purchased in 1983 by Dublin County Council, and since 1994 South Dublin County Council have managed the park.

The catcher was a native of Kinston, North Carolina; he was tall, weighed , batted left-handed and threw right-handed. White broke into pro ball with the Philadelphia Stars of the Negro American League in . After that season, he was acquired by the St. Louis Browns, whose owner, Bill Veeck, was active in integrating his organization's playing ranks. White spent three seasons in the upper levels of minor league baseball in the Browns' farm system before being traded to the Milwaukee Braves prior to the season. White then spent the entire season and the first two months of on the Braves' National League roster. Playing behind one of the league's workhorse catchers, Del Crandall, White appeared in 50 games in 1954, 16 as starting catcher (while Crandall started 133 of the Braves' 154 games).

Design They had outside frames to the six coupled driving wheels, but inside frames for the leading wheels. A distinctive visual feature, initially, was a large saddle-shaped sandbox over the first ring of the boiler. The class had two prototypes: No. 2601, was a 4-6-0, while No. 2602 was a 2-6-0. These were built in 1899, and Nos. 2603-2610, all 2-6-0s, followed later, up to 1903. Though Dean was officially still in charge, Churchward's influence is evident in the rugged design. Their perhaps ironic nickname was after Paul Kruger, the Boer War leader defeated by Lord Roberts in 1900. Problems Perhaps Churchward saw the chance of experimenting in the name of Dean, and this somewhat experimental class was not successful, the boiler with its high pressure and long combustion chamber gave trouble and the long stroke of the inside cylinders led to fractures of the solid crank axles. So the class was not long-lived and most were withdrawn around 1906. Several of the boilers were converted for stationary use in Swindon Works at reduced pressure, and remained in service there until the 1950s. Aberdare class Their numbers were adopted in 1907 by some of the last batch of the more elegant and reliable Aberdare Class 2-6-0s, which may also have re-used some of the \\"Kruger\\"s' parts.

The 7-episode series, which followed the renovation of a different public school each week, aired from October 15, 2010, to November 26, 2010. The premiere episode earned 2.90 million viewers. Premise Each week, cameras follow teachers, students and community members as they perform renovations on an ailing school, which will occur over a seven-day period (ten days for the first episode). A group of community organizers and personalities serve to motivate the volunteers and lead the community through the makeover process. Cameras will revisit the school a few months after the renovation to see how the community has been affected by the changes. Main cast *Jacob Soboroff, political correspondent *Kym Whitley, comedian and former substitute teacher *Susie Castillo, actress and Miss USA 2003 *Tom Stroup, SWAT Commander Development and production The series was based on the successful rehabilitation of Carver Elementary in Compton, California several years ago, in which a community came together to restore the dilapidated school. Executive producer Cheryl Hines volunteered during the renovation. Afterward, there were positive and lasting effects on the community, with an increase in property value and test scores. Hines felt this would be a good subject for a reality show. She teamed up with Denise Cramsey, a former executive producer on Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, and pitched the idea to NBC. In January 2010, NBC announced a two-hour special was in the works for Fall 2010. Enterprise Middle School in Compton, California was renovated over 10 days during the school's spring break. The special served as a backdoor pilot, and NBC green-lighted a series in mid-May. The additional episodes were filmed during renovations of the schools over July and August, 2010. Each school received approximately $2 million in upgrades and repairs. On November 23, 2010, Denise Cramsey died of a brain aneurysm at age 41.Stuart Levine, \\"Reality TV producer Denise Cramsey dead at 41\\", Variety, September 24, 2010.

Needles High School in Needles, California *Renovated from August 13 to August 19School Pride Volunteer announcement Hollenbeck Middle School in Los Angeles, California *Renovated August 22 to August 28 Criticism An article written by L.A. Times writer Steve Lopez discusses the initial hesitance of the Los Angeles Unified School District in allowing two of its schools (Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies (LACES) & Hollenbeck Middle School) participate in the show. District officials expressed concerns regarding the quality of work performed and products donated, the costs of repairs and maintenance of the renovations, granting 24-hr access to the schools, and the negative publicity that might be incurred by their involvement with the show. Eventually, LAUSD agreed to the makeovers. After the work was completed, criticism regarding \\"shoddy work\\" at Hollenbeck and a \\"reenacted [scene] that didn't happen\\" at LACES was cited as some validation for the district's reluctance. Some school district officials noted that LAUSD spent approximately $106,000 in associated costs as a result, but the value of the donations made by the show's corporate sponsors was not stated. Los Angeles Times television critic Mary McNamara noted that like most reality shows, the program \\"attempts to create narrative tension where there is none\\", but thought this wasn't important in this case because the point of the show was \\"not about the process or even the payoff, it's about the need\\" for help at many more schools.Mary McNamara, \\"Television review: 'School Pride': A team commits to renovating run-down schools in a new NBC reality show.\\" Los Angeles Times, October 15, 2010.

Though Sunland and Tujunga began as separate settlements, they are today linked through a single police station, branch library, neighborhood council, chamber of commerce, city council district, and high school and various civic organizations. The merging of these communities under a hyphenated name goes back as far as 1928.Hyphenated name first appeared in a baseball box score printed in the Los Angeles Times. http://search.proquest.com/docview/162177914 Sunland-Tujunga contains the highest point of the city, Mount Lukens. Geography =Setting= The neighborhood lies between the Verdugo Mountains and the San Gabriel Mountains. It is contiguous on the east with La Crescenta-Montrose. Sunland and Tujunga are divided by Mount Gleason Avenue, with Sunland on the west and Tujunga on the east. Mount Lukens within Tujunga is the highest point in Los Angeles at . =Thoroughfares= By 1927, half of the streets had been paved. A state highway ran through the town. M.V. Hartranft, for whom Hartranft Avenue was named Streets within the Sunland and Tuna Canyon annex to Los Angeles were renamed in June 1929. The main east-west road, previously known as Michigan Avenue, became Foothill Boulevard. Other streets were renamed as follows: Los Angeles Street to Apperson Avenue, Sherman Street to Hartranft Avenue, Center Street to Grenoble Avenue, North Street to Wentworth Avenue, Third Street to Woodward Avenue, and Hill Street to Hillrose Avenue. Sunset renamed to Commerce St. Manzanita Drive was renamed McGroarty Avenue in honor of John Steven McGroarty, who lived nearby.\\"Street Is Named for Mission Play Author\\", Los Angeles Times, June 18, 1929, page A-10 In the 1960s, the Sunland-Tujunga Chamber of Commerce took an active stand in opposition to routing the proposed Foothill Freeway through Shadow Hills, claiming the neighborhood's \\"rural atmosphere\\" would be destroyed and would wipe out 28 more homes than an alternate route.\\"Shadow Hills Freeway Route Plan Assailed\\", Los Angeles Times, April 5, 1964, page P-1 After years of discussion and delay, the final stretch of the freeway through Sunland-Tujunga was scheduled for dedication on April 3, 1981, with State Transportation Director Adriana Gianturco presiding.\\"Foothill Freeway Dedication Slated\\", Los Angeles Times, March 29, 1981 Exits in Sunland and Tujunga are, from west to east, at Sunland Boulevard, La Tuna Canyon Road, and Lowell Avenue (shared with La Crescenta). The freeway's right-of-way almost completely bypasses the main part of the community, and runs along a viaduct in the Verdugo Mountains. Today, the neighborhood has one major thoroughfare: Foothill Boulevard; nearly all businesses in Sunland-Tujunga are located on or near it. Tujunga Canyon Boulevard is a heavily travelled north-south route, but is primarily residential. Sunland Boulevard and Wentworth Street are popular surface streets that connect the community to Sun Valley and the rest of the city of Los Angeles. Sunland-Tujunga is also served by the Interstate 210 freeway.

Hitt, Sunland and Tujunga: from village to city, Making of America series, Arcadia Publishing, 2002, , p. 10 The term is thought to relate to an ethnohistoric narrative, known as Khra'wiyawi, collected by Carobeth Laird from Juan and Juana Menendez at the Leonis Adobe in 1916. In the narrative, the wife of Khra'wiyawi (the chief of the region) is stricken with grief over the untimely loss of her daughter. In her sadness, she retreats to the mountains and turns to stone.

The reference should properly have been to Rancho La Ca√±ada south to Big Tuna Canyon\\" and west to the then-Los Angeles boundary and Wicks Road. The attempt failed because Los Angeles annexed the area first. Tujunga's elevation and geographic isolation from the San Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles Basin freed it from some of the air pollution that was a problem in many other parts of Greater Los Angeles. Because of this, it attracted many asthmatics early on.

Tujunga finally gave up its independence and joined the city on March 8, 1932.\\"Tujunga Has Difficulty Joining Los Angeles\\", Los Angeles Times, March 8, 1932, page I-2 =Tuna Canyon Detention Station, 1941‚Äì1943= Detention station, 1941 Tuna Canyon Detention Station was a temporary holding facility used for the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II in the Tujunga community of Los Angeles, California. Some Italian Americans, German Americans, and Japanese Peruvians were also interned there. From this detention station, prisoners were later transferred to permanent internment camps.Masumoto, Marie. Tuna Canyon (Detention Facility). Densho Encyclopedia. Accessed February 11, 2015 =Gravel pit, 1950s, and 1960s= In 1959, a trial court held that the city had no authority to refuse a zoning variance to Consolidated Rock Company to continue operating a gravel pit in the Big Tujunga Wash, An appellate court overturned that decision, but in 1962, the California Supreme Court upheld the right of the city to ban the pit. The decision was a victory for local people who had battled the project for more than three years: They contended that the dust from the existing pit affected the area's reputation as a \\"haven for asthma sufferers\\". Attorney Peter R. Rice argued as a friend of the court that climate was more important than commercial mining operations. =City Council redistricting, 1986‚Äì2002= Los Angeles City Councilman Howard Finn of Sunland died in office on August 12, 1986,\\"Candlelight Service for Finn to be Held Tonight in Sunland\\", Los Angeles Times, August 20, 1986, page V-A-7 and his Northeast San Fernando Valley First District was left without an incumbent.\\"Rural Valley Area Draws the Line Over Redistricting Plan\\", Los Angeles Times, September 8, 1996, page B-1 Joel Wachs, 2012 At the same time, the City Council was under a court order to redistrict itself to provide more representation for Latinos. After a bitter contest in which Finn's semirural constituents fought against being combined with more built-up areas and amid traces of ethnic animosity,Bill Boyarsky, \\"Ethnic Remap Plan Proves to Be a Bitter Pill for Many\\", Los Angeles Times, September 11, 1986, page SD-3 the result was to move the vacant First District seat into a redrawn, 69% Latino area north and west of downtown Los AngelesVictor Merina and Richard Simon, \\"Wachs Fails in Last-Ditch Effort to Halt Remap Plan\\", Los Angeles Times, September 17, 1986, page B-1 and to place Sunland-Tujunga into a reshaped Second Council District, already represented by Joel Wachs. It was a Y-shaped configuration \\"with only a long, thin finger of territory\\" connecting Sunland- Tujunga on the north with Van Nuys on the south.For a map, see \\"Los Angeles' Realigned City Council Districts\\" Los Angeles Times, September 21, 1986, page B-3 A lawsuit against the plan was dismissed in late September by U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman.Richard Simon, \\"Redistricting Suit Against L.A. Council Is Dismissed\\" Los Angeles Times, September 23, 1986, page SD-3 Despite the fact that Wachs had struggled to prevent being assigned to a district that was 90% new to him, the councilman was warmly greeted when he arrived to meet his new constituents in a reception at the Sunland-Tujunga Municipal Building. He found an area with a down-home, rural flavor and about 30% of the voters in his new district.Myron Levin, \\"Affable Crowd Makes Wachs Feel at Home in New District\\", Los Angeles Times, October 19, 1986, page V-5 He told a reporter: > There hasn't been one nasty person, one hostile. . . They want to be > friends.. . . In the second-largest city in the U.S., that you can have an > area like this to live in is just fantastic. Wherever I've gone, preserving > the lifestyle seems to be the number-one issue. Wachs served on the council for 15 more years. He resigned effective 2001, and a city redistricting commission took the opportunity to propose a shakeup in boundaries, splitting the Second District in two.http://search.proquest.com/docview/421829501 Before that could be considered, though, Wendy Greuel was elected to the city council. In March 2002, she reopened the Sunland-Tujunga field office (closed by Wachs),Patrick McGreevy, \\"Government: She reopens a field office, names chief of staff and pushes for resources in her 2nd District on a busy first day\\" Los Angeles Times, April 4, 2002, page B-3 and the redistricting plan was never heard of again. Greuel served until July 2009. She was succeeded by Paul Krekorian. =Home Depot controversy, 2005‚Äì2009= In January 2009, hardware company Home Depot announced it was giving up a five-year effort to turn a former Kmart store at the corner of Foothill Boulevard and Woodward Avenue, Tujunga, into a big-box store of its own.David Zahniser, \\"Home Depot drops bid to open store in Sunland-Tujunga\\" Los Angeles Times, January 8, 2009 The Los Angeles Times reported: > Opponents also mobilized hundreds of people to turn out for meetings on the > project, including a marathon seven-hour session that turned into a shouting > match over day laborers and immigration. Home Depot, in turn, had retained a > team of expensive lobbyists who arranged for buses to transport supporters > to meetings at city hall. In 2006, one of those lobbyists sent a memo > promising to feed and transport 150 people in orange T-shirts to a city > council hearing, where they would appear in favor of Home Depot‚Äîat a cost of > $24,000 to the company.\\"Home Depot's Foes Win a Round in Sunland\\", Los > Angeles Times, March 10, 2007, page B-6 The city council determined that the extent of construction involved exceeded the limits of what is known as \\"tenant improvements\\" and thus qualified as a \\"project\\" subject to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Under CEQA rules, Home Depot would be required to carry out an environmental impact report, so the company filed a lawsuit against Council Member Wendy Greuel, accusing her of improperly interfering with the process. The company paid $2 million to lobbying firms on behalf of the project. =Homelessness, 2010 and after= Beginning in 2010, news accounts began to highlight a homeless problem in the Big Tujunga Wash. As Channel 7 Eyewitness News put it: > For years, the Big Tujunga Wash has provided a picturesque backdrop for > local residents who enjoy the rare natural river bed that's perfect for > hiking, jogging, or collecting butterflies. Also, the new Angeles National > Golf Club is right in the middle of the wash. But, residents say there's > trouble brewing in Big Tujunga. Homeless camps are big concerns for > residents, who say they sympathize with the homeless, but say they drag in > too much trash. Major cleanups were undertaken in the homeless encampments in the wash in 2015 and later, with tons of trash removed by volunteers and by city workers. One of them was reported as follows: > The cleanup -- and summary eviction of as many as a hundred squatters -- on > 300 acres of private land a little more than a mile upstream from Hansen Dam > was organized and financed by property owners of the Riverwood community of > Sunland, a hillside enclave of about 35 homes whose residents come and go on > a single road crossing the wash. Over the last three years, the growth of > the shanty village has despoiled a public resource and subjected homes along > Oro Vista Avenue to burglaries and the threat of violence, said Brian > Schneider, who spoke for the residents.Doug Smith, \\"Public Versus Private > Land: Cleaning Up Tujunga Wash; Homeowners and City Have Conflicting Views > of Homelessness,\\" Los Angeles Times, November 15, 2015, page B-1 Population In 2009, the Los Angeles Times's \\"Mapping L.A.\\" project supplied these neighborhood statistics based on the 2000 census, showing that Sunland, including Shadow Hills, had a census-measured population of 28,414 in 2000. Tujunga was slightly smaller, at 26,527. In both Sunland and Tujunga, the percentage of White people was high for the county. The percentages of divorced males, married females, and divorced females were among the county's highest. ; Sunland: Population (without Shadow Hills): 15,316. Median household income: $68,720, high for the city of Los Angeles, but about average for the county. The percentage of residents 25 and older with a high-school diploma and some college education was high for the county. ; Shadow Hills: Population: 13,098. It was a moderately diverse neighborhood. The area had a high family income. The median age at 39 was old for both the county and the city. The percentages of veterans who served during World War II or Korea and Vietnam were among the county's highest. ; Tujunga: Population: 26,527. Median household income: $58,001. The percentages of residents 25 and older with a high school diploma and some college education were high for the county. The median age was 36, old for the city of Los Angeles but about average for the county. The percentage of residents ages 35 to 49 was among the county's highest. 9.7 percent of the population were veterans, high for the city of Los Angeles but about average for the county overall. The percentage of Vietnam veterans was among the county's highest. Reputation Sunland-Tujunga's reputation has changed over the years. =Fresh air= In the 1950s through the 1970s, the area was known as a \\"haven for asthma sufferers\\"\\"City Ban Upheld on Tujunga Gravel Pit,\\" Los Angeles Times, April 13, 1962, page A-11 and that it was \\"long noted for the beneficial qualities of its pure air\\" and had a \\"reputation as a health resort\\"Ed Ainsworth, \\"On the Move: Saving of Historic Hall Requested,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 26, 1954, page 25 or a \\"reputation for clean mountain air\\".Barbara Riker, \\"Smog, Dust Menace Home for Asthmatics,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 8, 1970, page SF-A-1 Tujunga was seen as having a \\"near-Switzerland setting ‚Äì high and dry\\".\\"Emotions Linked to Asthma Attack,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 16, 1951, page 20 In 1957, Coronet called Tujunga \\"the most healthy place in the world,\\" and that publicity brought a flood of inquiries into the office of the Sunland-Tujunga Chamber of Commerce, hundreds a month.Dick Degnon, \\"Valley's Healthy Climate Prompts Flood of Inquiries,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 13, 1957, page L-9 In 1963, the area was seen as \\"famous for its climate beneficial to asthma sufferers\\".\\"Council Denies Tujunga Rock Mine Extension,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 17, 1963, page SF-1 =Biker gangs= By 1990, however, Tujunga had somehow developed a reputation as a \\"tough community\\" and a \\"center for biker gangs\\". As a Los Angeles Times writer put it: > No one really knows why so many long-haired, bearded young men on > motorcycles, aligned in groups with names like \\"The Devil's Henchmen\\", chose > to hang out in this workingman's community perched on the southwest slopes > of the San Gabriel Mountains a half dozen miles north of downtown Glendale. > But hang out they did, in droves, and Tujunga developed an unenviable > reputation as one of Southern California's premier \\"biker towns\\".Gordon > Dillow, \\"'Bikers Town' Shifts to Homey Cycle,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 10, > 1990, page 2 In 2001, another writer called Sunland-Tujunga \\"part middle-class suburb, eclectic mountain hideaway, and rundown commercial strip dotted with biker hangouts\\".John Corrigan, \\"Legacy of a Beating,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 4, 2001, page 1 That same year, still another writer said this about Tujunga: > Police say the bad-apple bikers bring a particular set of problems, mainly > the use and sale of speed [ methamphetamine ].

A charge of de facto segregation was made by Los Angeles Valley College instructor John Buchanan, who lived in Pacoima, and by the Sunland-Tujunga Human Relations Council, whose president, Paul Tsuneishi, said overcrowding at Mt. Gleason resulted in classes being held on an auditorium stage, a corrective physical education room, and a multipurpose room. Shadow Hills, midway between the two schools,See the map at \\"Shadow Hills Plans Fight on School Boundary Ruling\\", Los Angeles Times, July 18, 1966 was an optional attendance area for either school, and 215 of its children were attending Mount Gleason, versus just 22 at Maclay.

They can't ride horses if they spend all their time riding buses to and from school.\\"\\"Property Owners Deny Racism in School Issue\\", Los Angeles Times, April 1, 1966 The Los Angeles school board approved the boundary switch in a 4-3 vote on July 14, 1966.

Cross-district busing, 1977‚Äì1981 Sunland-Tujunga residents were foremost in a fight against mandatory busing for the purpose of school desegregation in Los Angeles. On January 21, 1977, an estimated 4,000 students‚Äîabout half the total enrollment‚Äîstayed away from classes at nine Sunland-Tujunga schools as parents, led by Samm Ferris of Sunland, staged a one-day boycott to protest any idea of mandatory busing. About 35 \\"concerned mothers\\" picketed three elementary schools, as well as Mount Gleason Junior High and Verdugo Hills High schools.William Tromblely and Jack McCurdy, \\"4,000 Students Boycott 9 Schools in Busing Protest\\" Los Angeles Times, January 22, 1977, page 3 In May of the same year, Donna Kent of Sunland-Tujunga became president of the local chapter of Bustop, a citywide group opposed to the busing program. She said her chapter managed to raise $1,000 of the $5,000 needed monthly for lawyers, by holding raffles, rummage sales, and Tupperware parties.Bill Boyarsky, \\"How Bustop Became Force in School Suit\\", Los Angeles Times, May 15, 1977, page C-1 In August 1980, as the school district was making plans to bus some students from Sunland Elementary School to Pacoima, about 100 parents met at the school to protest. Parent Betty Reeve said she and others had organized a \\"Yellow Flu\\" campaign to keep students away from school and show that \\"our kids are sick of riding a yellow school bus.\\"Jan Klunder and Alan Maltun, \\"Sunland-Tujunga Parents Make It Clear at Meeting: They Don't Want Busing\\" Los Angeles Times, August 17, 1980, page GB-3 Nevertheless, a busing procedure resulted in White elementary students from Apperson Street, Sunland, Plainview Avenue, and Mountain View elementary schools in Sunland-Tujunga being exchanged with minority counterparts in Lake View Terrace, Sun Valley, and North Hollywood. Mount Gleason Junior High and Verdugo Hills High Schools did not take part. Mandatory busing was ended by a decision of the California Supreme Court on March 12, 1981,Pamela G. Hollie, \\"Foes of Busing Hail Los Angeles Victory\\", New York Times, March 13, 1981 and when the practice was finally stopped the next month, most of the Sunland- Tujunga pupils returned to their neighborhood schools, but most of the previously enrolled minority students continued to be bused into Sunland- Tujunga on a voluntary basis.Alan Maltun, \\"Mandatory Busing Comes to Quiet End\\", Los Angeles Times, April 26, 1981 'Parent trigger', 2010 By February 2010, Mount Gleason Middle School had been on a federal list of underperforming campuses for 12 years, and a group of parents organized to take advantage of a new state law in an attempt to force administrative changes. The law, dubbed the \\"parent trigger\\", could compel districts to take drastic action to fix failing schools if a majority of parents petitioned for an overhaul. In an interview, four parents told CNN in October 2010 that Mount Gleason was unsafe and they wanted the principal ousted.

Discovery and naming Illustration of the bones in the holotype All specimens of Sarahsaurus were collected from the Early Jurassic Kayenta Formation near Gold Spring, Arizona. The genus is based on a nearly complete and articulated (with bones still connected to each other) skeleton with a fragmentary and disarticulated skull (holotype, specimen number TMM 43646-2). In addition, a partial skeleton (specimen number TMM 43646-3) as well as a nearly complete skull (specimen number MCZ 8893) was assigned to the genus. The latter specimen was originally referred to as Massospondylus sp. The complete skull is crushed and split horizontally, separating the skull roof from the palate; this split was caused by periodic swelling and shrinkage of the surrounding clay after burial. While the holotype individual was mature, the second skull indicates a less mature individual as indicated by open suture lines that separate skull bones of the braincase (the bones enclosing the brain). Sarahsaurus was first described by Timothy B. Rowe, Hans-Dieter Sues and Robert R. Reisz in 2011; the type species is Sarahsaurus aurifontanalis. The generic name honours Sarah Butler and is derived from the Greek sauros meaning \\"lizard\\". The specific name is derived from aurum (Latin), \\"gold\\", and fontanalis (Latin), \\"of the spring\\" in reference to Gold Spring, Arizona, where the holotype was found. Sarahsaurus is the fourth basal sauropodomorph dinosaur to have been identified in North America; the other three are Anchisaurus and Ammosaurus from the Early Jurassic of the Connecticut River Valley, and Seitaad of the later Navajo Sandstone of Early Jurassic Utah. It is thought to have appeared through a dispersal event that originated in South America and was separate from those of the other two sauropodomorphs. The animal is notable for possessing very large, powerful hands, possibly suggesting that it was an omnivore.http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/101006-new-dinosaur- north-america-science/ Description Sarahsaurus was a basal (or \\"primitive\\") member of the sauropodomorph lineage, which also included the more derived (or \\"advanced\\") sauropods ‚Äì giant four-legged herbivores (plant- eaters) with long necks and tails. Basal sauropodomorphs such as Sarahsaurus already resemble sauropods in a number of aspects, including the elongated neck and robust build, but are reminiscent of the ancestral dinosaurs in others: Sarahsaurus was bipedal (two-legged), with forelimbs that were much shorter than the hind limbs and equipped with powerful grasping hands. Sarahsaurus was mid-sized for a basal sauropodomorph, with its vertebral column measuring more than in length. Paleontologist Gregory Paul, in a 2016 popular book, estimated its length at and its body weight at . =Skull= The (skull opening for the nostril) was less than half the size of the orbit (eye socket). It was bordered by the nasal, premaxilla, and, to a small extent, the maxilla, the latter two forming the upper jaw. Between the premaxilla and maxilla there was a large opening, the subnarial foramen. The antorbital fossa, an additional skull opening seen in most dinosaurs that was situated between the external naris and orbit, was less than half the length of the orbit. Much of the upper margin of the orbit was formed by the of the ; this bone, however, did not contribute to the front margin of the at the rear end of the skull roof. Instead, this front margin was formed by the and , with the front part of the parietal being forked to connect with the latter. Between the parietal and the supraoccipital, which follows behind the parietal at the back of the skull, was another opening, the postparietal fenestra, which was large in Sarahsaurus. A unique feature of the genus can be found on the underside of the braincase, where a shallow ridge spanned between the , bony downwards projections of the braincase that brace the latter against the . The lower jaw curved downwards towards its tip, and the jaw joint was located well below the level of the tooth row. There is no evidence for a beak. Each side of the upper jaw was lined with 20 teeth ‚Äì four in the premaxilla, the front bone of the upper jaw, and 16 in the maxilla which followed behind. The dentary bone of the lower jaw likewise had 20 teeth. The teeth were moderately heterodont, i.e., tooth shape varied within the jaw, and sat slightly obliquely in the jaw, slightly overlapping each other. Their cutting edges were with up to 20 per tooth. =Postcranium= The spine comprised 10 cervical (neck) vertebrae; 14 dorsal (trunk) vertebrae; three sacral (hip) vertebrae; and ca. 50 caudal (tail) vertebrae. In contrast to the later sauropods, the sides of the dorsal vertebrae did not show deep cavities caused by air sacs invading the bone (). The scapula (shoulder blade) was hourglass- shaped. In the holotype specimen, the scapula and coracoid were unfused, probably connected only via cartilage; this might indicate that the individual was not yet fully mature. The holotype specimen includes the sternum (breastbone) and the (collarbone), which are rarely found with dinosaur skeletons. The clavicula is a rod-like bone that articulates with the lower end of the scapula in an immobile joint. It has been controversial if the left and right clavicles of sauropodomorphs were attached to each other at their ends, thus connecting the left and right shoulder girdles, or if they were pressed against their scapulae along their lengths. The orientation of the clavicle in Sarahsaurus confirms that the former was the case; the ends of both clavicles would probably have been connected to each other by a ligament, though they were not fused. In side view, the scapula was tilted between 45¬∞ and 65¬∞ relative to the horizontal. This would have allowed the left and right coracoids to almost touch each other at the body midline, while the left and right sterna, which were attached to each other at the midline, would have been located directly behind the coracoids. The humerus (upper arm bone) was more than half the length of the femur (upper thigh bone), and had a large crest on its front side for muscle attachment, the , which extended for half the length of the bone and had an S-shaped edge. In the hand, the (claw bone) of the first finger was the largest. In the hip, the ilium had two downwards- facing bony projections, the ischial and pubic peduncle, which connected to the two lower hip bones, the ischium and the pubis, respectively, as in other dinosaurs. In Sarahsaurus, the ischial peduncle was only half the length of the pubic peduncle. The (hip joint) was formed by all three hip bones, as in other dinosaurs, though in Sarahsaurus the ischium contributed less than half as much as the pubis. The pubis was unique in having two separate openings, the and the pubic foramen; the latter was lacking in most other archosaurs. The femur was straight and elliptical in cross-section. The tibia (shin bone) reached 84% of the length of the femur. Classification Holotype braincase in multiple views In a cladistic analysis, presented by Apaldetti and colleagues in November 2011, Sarahsaurus was found to be most closely related to Ignavusaurus within Massopoda. Their group was found to be intermediate between plateosaurids and massospondylids, being more derived than the former and more primitive than the latter. A 2018 cladistic analysis by Chapelle and Choiniere recovered Sarahsaurus and Ignavusaurus as massospondylids, mirroring the original assignemt of Sarahsaurus to Massospondylus.Chapelle KEJ, Choiniere JN.

M. Clark and D. E. Fastovsky. 1986. Vertebrate biostratigraphy of the Glen Canyon Group in northern Arizona. The Beginning of the Age of the Dinosaurs: Faunal change across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, N. C. Fraser and H.-D. Sues (eds.), Cambridge University Press 285‚Äì301 It has been surmised that the Kayenta Formation was deposited during the Sinemurian and Pliensbachian stages of the Early Jurassic Period or approximately 199 to 182 million years ago.Padian, K (1997) Glen Canyon Group In: Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs, edited by Currie, P. J., and Padian, K., Academic Press. The Kayenta Formation is part of the Glen Canyon Group that includes formations not only in northern Arizona but also parts of southeastern Utah, western Colorado, and northwestern New Mexico. The formation was primarily deposited by rivers. During the Early Jurassic period, the land that is now the Kayenta Formation experienced rainy summers and dry winters. By the Middle Jurassic period it was being encroached upon from the north by a sandy dune field that would become the Navajo Sandstone. The animals here were adapted to a seasonal climate and abundant water could be found in streams, ponds and lakes. =Paleofauna= Sarahsaurus shared its paleoenvironment with other dinosaurs, such as several theropods including Dilophosaurus, Kayentavenator,Gay, R. 2010.

Coelophyisis kayentakatae, and the \\"Shake N Bake\\" theropod, and the armored dinosaurs Scelidosaurus and Scutellosaurus. The Kayenta Formation has yielded a small but growing assemblage of organisms. Vertebrates present in the Kayenta Formation at the time of Saharasaurus included hybodont sharks, indeterminate bony fish, lungfish, salamanders, the frog Prosalirus, the caecilian Eocaecilia, the turtle Kayentachelys, a sphenodontian reptile, various lizards, and the pterosaur Rhamphinion. Also present were the synapsids Dinnebitodon, Kayentatherium, Oligokyphus, morganucodontids, the possible early true mammal Dinnetherium, and a haramiyid mammal. Several early crocodylomorphs were present including Calsoyasuchus, Eopneumatosuchus, Kayentasuchus, and Protosuchus.Jenkins, F. A., Jr., Crompton, A. W., and Downs, W. R. 1983.

The film was also selected as the Peruvian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards but it did not make the final shortlist. Plot Miguel (Cristian Mercado) is a young fisherman of Cabo Blanco, a small village in northern Peru with specific traditions regarding death. He is married to Mariela (Tatiana Astengo), who is pregnant with their first son, but he also has a secret affair with a male painter called Santiago (Manolo Cardona). Santiago accidentally drowns at sea, and his ghost returns to ask Miguel to find his body, in order to bury it with their village's rituals. Miguel eventually finds Santiago's body in the water, but does not tell his ghost of the discovery. Meanwhile, the villagers discover nude paintings of Miguel at Santiago's house, fueling a rumour that he was having an affair. Mariela hears the rumours, confronts Miguel about them, and upon hearing him confess, she goes to her mother's house with their newborn child. Miguel returns to look for the body of Santiago, but he finds that the current has taken it away. Mariela eventually returns home, but then the body of Santiago appears in the nets of a fishing boat. Miguel decides to claim the body of Santiago for a burial at sea.

He introduced a range of administrative reforms in Sri Lanka, introducing numerous liberal ideas and supporting the rights of natives. He was also an orientalist and along with Henry Thomas Colebrooke and others he was a founding member of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Early life Johnston was born in Carnsalloch, Dumfriesshire in Scotland to Samuel Johnston and Hester Napier, daughter of Francis Napier, 6th Lord Napier. Johnston moved with his family when his father obtained a posting in Madurai under Lord Macartney in the Madras Presidency in 1781. Alexander received his early education from Christian Friedrich Schwarz, the missionary as well as under Sir Thomas Munro. He could speak Tamil, Telugu, and Hindustani languages from an early age. Colonial career Portrait of Johnston At the age of eleven, Alexander was offered a commission in the Dragoons but he chose instead to join the family to return to England in 1792. At the advice of Lord Macartney he studied law, initially at G√∂ttingen and then at Lincoln's Inn. In 1799 he accepted a post as Advocate General in Ceylon in 1799 shortly after his marriage to Louisa Campbell (1766‚Äì1852), the daughter of Captain Lord William Campbell of the Royal Navy. He became a chief justice in 1805 and in 1809 he was asked to provide suggestions for the administration of Ceylon, many of which were included in the charter for the East India Company in 1813. He was knighted in 1811 and by 1817 he took up an honorary position as an admiralty judge. Johnston was responsible for bringing the Mahavamsa, Sri Lanka's historical epic, to European attention when he sent manuscripts of it and other Sinhala chronicles to Europe for publication during his tenure as Chief Justice. Jonhston encouraged the translation of the Mahavamsa and other works in order to bring British colonial law into alignment with local traditions and values. The reforms that Sir Alexander Johnston made included universal public education, freedom of religious practice, abolishment of slavery, employment of natives in government, and the codification of laws including the traditional views of Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhists.

Rasmussen.The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand at the Library of Congress It includes essays by nine different authors covering Rand's views in various areas of philosophy. The work received positive reviews, crediting it with bringing serious attention by philosophers to Rand and her work. However, reviewers also noted that the work assumed considerable prior knowledge of philosophy on the part of the reader. Contents The book is divided into three sections that represent different areas of philosophy addressed in Rand's thought. Each section starts with an essay by Den Uyl and Rasmussen, followed by essays from other contributors. The first section covers metaphysics and epistemology. It includes essays by Wallace Matson and Robert Hollinger. The second section covers ethics and contains essays by Jack Wheeler, Charles King, and Erick Mack. The final section covers political philosophy and has essays by Antony Flew and Tibor R. Machan. Publication history Den Uyl and Rassmussen began work on the book while Rand was still alive. When she heard about the project, she actively discouraged it, as she had done previously with other projects. Rand died in 1982, and work on the book proceeded despite her disapproval. The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand was first published by as a hardcover book by the University of Illinois Press in 1984. They released it as a paperback in 1986. Reception Sidney Gendin gave The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand a positive review in Library Journal, writing that the work redressed the neglect of Rand's work by academic philosophers, avoided being uncritical of Rand, and revealed interesting parallels between Rand and writers such as Gilbert Ryle and J. L. Austin. However, he noted that the book assumed that the reader had \\"considerable background in general philosophy\\". A review in The Freeman praised the book as \\"a valuable beginning by serious philosophers at the important task of evaluating, describing, and developing Rand's philosophy, in a dispassionate, objective manner.\\" In Reason, the philosopher Randall Dipert wrote that the book \\"marks a turning point\\" in getting professional philosophers engaged with Rand's ideas, but was not \\"uniformly successful\\". Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein described it as \\"a major contribution to Rand scholarship\\", although not always approachable for readers not versed in academic philosophy. In 2003, Chris Matthew Sciabarra identified The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand as one of several books that reflected a growing interest in Rand after her death.

A member of the Republican Party, Volk served as the Mayor of Englewood, New Jersey, and in the New Jersey State Assembly for two terms during his political career. Biography =Early life= Volk was born at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, New Jersey on December 28, 1918, to Nicholas and Helen Volk. He graduated from Dwight Morrow High School in Englewood in 1937. Volk graduated from Brown University, where he became a cadet in the U.S. Naval Reserve Officer Training Program and a Delta Kappa Epsilon member. Volk served in the United States Navy during both World War II and the Korean War, reaching the rank of captain. During World War II, Volk participated at the Battle of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands as the commanding officer of a landing craft. Volk is credited with discovering the Brown Bear River in the Solomon Islands and naming it after Brown University during the war. Volk returned to New Jersey following the end of World War II. He began working at Nicholas Volk and Co., his family's insurance office in New York City. He remained a member of the U.S. Naval Reserve and was recalled to active duty during the Korean War. Volk became a logistical support team commander during the Korean War. He once again returned to his family's insurance business after the Korean War. He would later retire from the United States Navy in 1965, having reached the rank of captain. Volk owned an insurance business and was mayor of Englewood, New Jersey from 1960 to 1963 and 1966 to 1970. He later served two terms in the New Jersey General Assembly. =Political career= Volk was elected to two nonconsecutive terms as mayor of Englewood, New Jersey, during the 1960s. He served his first term from 1960 until 1963. The city of Englewood was ordered to desegregate its public school system during his first term. He was elected to a second, nonconsecutive term in 1965, taking office in January 1965. The 1967 Newark riots, which lasted from July 12-17, 1967, broke out in Newark, New Jersey, which is located south of Englewood. On July 21, days after the end of Newark's violence, unrest broke out in Englewood's 4th Ward, a predominantly African American section of Englewood. African Americans had complained of substandard, slum housing and police neglect in the otherwise affluent city. The Englewood unrest, which lasted for five days. included instances of rock throwing, broken windows and one example of gunfire. Several police officers and residents were injured. At one stage of the troubles, he used a helicopter to direct the police. Volk, who was 17 months into his second term at the time of the unrest, agreed to meet with African American leaders and ministers to discuss their grievances during the Englewood riots. He vowed to demolish slum properties in the 4th Ward and increase career prospects for residents. Volk also condemned the violence in Englewood committed by some rioters. At one point during the unrest, Volk wore his Navy uniform as he walked down Palisade Avenue in the 4th Ward with Englewood police and fire fighters. Volk felt that walking with the police and fire fighters would project stability and the need to negotiate the end to the riots. After the riots he appointed a community relations committee to help defuse racial tensions by integrating classes in five elementary schools. However, his actions and use of the police were questioned by some African American leaders. Arnold Brown, who was serving as the first African American state assemblyman from Bergen County at the time, felt that Volk \\"elevated the situation\\" through the heavy use of police in remarks about Volk in 2010. Brown explained that, \\"We had our differences in the '60s... He was just a conservative looking for the status quo.\\" In the fall of 1967, Volk was defeated in his bid for a third term by his Democratic opponent. Democrats also gained the majority of seats on the Englewood City Council in the election. Volk left office in January 1968. Volk was elected to the New Jersey State Assembly in 1970 representing the 37th Legislative District. He served two terms in the Assembly. Volk retired from the insurance industry in the late 2000s. =Later life= Volk married the former Rae P. Glidden in 1979. Glidden was the widow of John C. Glidden, who had served as the president of the Englewood City Council. The couple remained together until her death in 2009. Austin Volk died at his home in Southampton, New York, on September 18, 2010, at the age of 91. He had been a longtime summer resident of Southampton. He was buried at Brookside Cemetery in Englewood.

It conducts research and analysis primarily on human development data from the United States at the national, state, and county levels. Measure of America aims to stimulate fact- based dialogue about human development issues in the United States by ‚Äú[breathing] life into numbers, [and] using data to create compelling narratives that foster greater understanding of our shared challenges and greater support for people-centered policies.‚Äù Measure of America‚Äôs seminal work is the American Human Development Index. Its U.S. specific index is based on human development concepts introduced by Mahbub ul Haq and Amartya Sen. In partnership with foundations, non-profit organizations, government offices, and corporations, Measure of America has produced reports, interactive tools, and services focused on data analysis and data visualization. American Human Development Reports The American Human Development Report is a biennial report on human well-being in the United States produced by Measure of America. It follows the human development concept, which is the process of expanding the well-being of individuals to develop their full potential, by increasing opportunities in the arenas of health, education, and income. Similar to the global Human Development Report, published annually by the United Nations Development Programme, and the National Human Development Reports (NHDRs), the American Human Development Reports serve as advocacy tools to spur lively debates and mobilize support for action and change.http://www.measureofamerica.org/human-development/#american human development index =The Measure of America, 2013‚Äì2014= The Measure of America, 2013‚Äì2014 was co-authored by Sarah Burd-Sharps and Kristen Lewis. It is the third in the American Human Development Reports series and, like its predecessors, includes updated Index rankings while examining changes in well- being since 2000, as well as before and after the Great Recession. The report provides information for the country as a whole, the 50 U.S. states, the 25 largest metropolitan areas, and racial and ethnic groups within those regions. The report was funded by the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation.http://www.measureofamerica.org/measure_of_america2013-2014/ =The Measure of America, 2010‚Äì2011= The Measure of America, 2010‚Äì2011: Mapping Risks and Resilience was co-authored by Sarah Burd-Sharps and Kristen Lewis, and includes a foreword by Jeffrey Sachs. The second in the American Human Development Reports series, the 2010‚Äì2011 edition features updated Index rankings of the 50 states and 435 congressional districts; reveals huge disparities in the health, education, and the standard of living of different racial and ethnic groups from state to state; and shines a spotlight on disparities within the ten largest metropolitan areas in the country. The report was funded by the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation and The Lincy Foundation, and is a joint publication of the Social Science Research Council and New York University Press.http://www.measureofamerica.org/the-measure-of- america-2010-2011-book/ =The Measure of America, 2008‚Äì2009= The Measure of America: American Human Development Report, 2008‚Äì2009 was written, compiled, and edited by Sarah Burd-Sharps, Kristen Lewis, and Eduardo Borges Martins, and includes forewords by Amartya Sen and William H.

It was jointly published by the Social Science Research Council and Columbia University Press. State Human Development Reports =A Portrait of California= Released in May 2011, the California report provides an in-depth look at the well-being of people living in the most populous and the most diverse state in America. The report presents Human Development Index values for the five largest metro areas in the state as well as for eight economic regions and 233 neighborhood and county groups covering the entire state. American HD Index values for each major racial/ethnic group, for women and men, and for both native and foreign-born Californians were calculated using mortality data from the California Department of Public Health and earnings and education data from the American Community Survey of the U.S. Census Bureau. Following in the mold of state-level reports on Mississippi and Louisiana, the report makes extensive use of Census Bureau- designated Public Use Microdata Areas (referred to as \\"neighborhood and county groups\\"), in order to highlight disparities in well-being at the local level.http://www.measureofamerica.org/california/ Preliminary findings provide evidence that some groups in California experience some of the highest levels of well-being and access to opportunity in the nation‚Äîindeed, in the world‚Äîwhile others are facing distressing challenges when it comes to the basic building blocks of opportunity.http://www.measureofamerica.org/california/ For instance: * People in the section of Orange County that runs from Newport Beach to Laguna Hills have a life expectancy of about 88 years‚Äîfifteen years longer than life expectancy in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles (about 73 years). * In the Los Angeles communities of Bel Air, Brentwood, and Pacific Palisades, nearly all adults (97% and higher) have completed high school, whereas in nearby Vernon-Central, only a little more than one-third of all adults have completed this basic educational qualification.http://www.measureofamerica.org/california/ * Median personal annual earnings range from about $15,000 in the Los Angeles neighborhoods around East Adams and Exposition Park to nearly $73,000 in the Santa Clara communities of Cupertino, Saratoga, and Los Gatos. * Statewide, men have median personal earnings of $34,099, whereas women bring home significantly less: $25,188.http://www.measureofamerica.org/california/ The California state report is supported by the California Community Foundation, the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, the Draper Foundation, the California Endowment, The Lincy Foundation, the San Francisco Foundation, United Way of California, and the Weingart Foundation.http://www.measureofamerica.org/california/ =A Portrait of Louisiana= Louisiana ranked near the bottom of the American Human Development Index, and has gained attention in recent years in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. On September 17, 2009, Measure of America released A Portrait of Louisiana: Louisiana Human Development Report 2009, the first major research effort into health, education, and income in the state to use post-Katrina data. Among the findings, the report concludes that acute human vulnerability persists, as do profound disparities between certain groups, especially between blacks and whites. The report was commissioned by Oxfam America and the Louisiana Disaster Recovery Foundation, with funding from Oxfam America and the Foundation for the Mid South.http://www.measureofamerica.org/louisiana/ =A Portrait of Mississippi= Mississippi ranked last among U.S. states on the American Human Development Index in 2008‚Äì2009. The Mississippi State Conference NAACP commissioned Measure of America to apply the methodology of the national report to the state level. A Portrait of Mississippi: Mississippi Human Development Report 2009 was released on January 26, 2009. The report revealed that some groups in the state enjoy well-being levels similar to those in top- ranked Connecticut, while others experience levels of human development typical of the average American nearly a half century ago. The report contains policy recommendations to address disparities by geography, race, and gender.http://www.measureofamerica.org/mississippi/ County Human Development Reports =A Portrait of Marin= Released on 18 January 2012, A Portrait of Marin provides an investigation of well-being in Marin County, California and highlights actions that Marinites can take to lock in human development successes today while setting the stage for significant budget savings and improved well-being tomorrow.A Portrait of Marin Some residents of Marin are enjoying extraordinarily high levels of well-being and access to opportunity, while others are experiencing levels of health, education, and standard of living that prevailed in the nation three decades ago. At the top of the rankings is Ross (HDI: 9.70), with the Canal area of San Rafael scoring the lowest (HDI: 3.18), below that of West Virginia, the lowest ranked state. Rankings are provided for the major racial and ethnic groups, men and women, native- and foreign-born residents, and Marin‚Äôs fifty-one census tracts for which there are reliable U.S Census data. Select findings from the report illustrate these disparities: * The average Ross resident lives nearly eight years longer than the average Californian and an astonishing decade longer than the national average. * While 88 percent of white children are enrolled in preschool, only 47 percent of Latino children are. * The distribution of income in Marin is exceedingly lopsided; the top fifth of Marin taxpayers take home about 71 percent of the county‚Äôs total income. The bottom fifth earns 1.3 percent of the total income. The Marin County report was commissioned by the Marin Community Foundation (MCF). =A Portrait of Sonoma= Released May 20, 2014, A Portrait of Sonoma County provides an in-depth look at how residents of Sonoma County are faring in three fundamental areas of life: health, access to knowledge, and living standards. Select findings from the report include: * An entire decade separates the life expectancies in the top and bottom census tracts. Those who are born in Kenwood/Glen Ellen can expect to live 75.2 years, while those in Central Bennett Valley average 85.7 years. * Men in Sonoma County earn about $8,500 more than women. This wage gap is similar to the gap between men and women at the state level, although it is around $1,000 smaller than at the national level. The Sonoma County report was commissioned by Sonoma County Department of Health Services (DHS). Thematic Briefs =Highway to Health: Life Expectancy in Los Angeles County, 2017= Highway to Health presents life expectancy calculations for cities and unincorporated areas in Los Angeles County as well as for planning areas and city council districts within the City of Los Angeles. These place-based life expectancy calculations are the most up-to-date figures available; calculating life expectancy by place is a complicated exercise, and updated estimates had not been released for over a decade. Highway to Health was released as a health- focused preview to A Portrait of Los Angeles County. Key findings from the brief include: * A baby born today in Los Angeles County can expect to live 82.1 years, on average‚Äîa longer life expectancy than that of the average Californian or the average American. * If Los Angeles County were a country, it would rank an impressive eleventh in the world in terms of longevity. * In some parts of Los Angeles, residents routinely live into their 90s, an astonishing decade longer than the already impressive countywide average; in others, life expectancies in the mid-70s reflect far too many premature deaths. =Who Graduates?, 2017= Who Graduates? uses a dataset obtained by special agreement from the NYC Department of Education to look at high school graduation through the lens of types of high school programs students are admitted to. The mandatory high school choice system is a complex, high-stakes process that New York City eighth graders must navigate every year in order to gain admission to high school. The original research informed a New York Times feature story that asked and answered important questions about school choice and how to ensure every student has access to the best education the city has to offer. Key findings from the brief include: * A striking 97.4 percent of students admitted to high school based on the SHSAT graduated on time in 2015, compared to only 59.8 percent of those admitted to educational option programs and 68.1 percent of those admitted to limited unscreened programs. * Overall, 16.6 percent of Asian American students were admitted to specialized high schools; only 1.1 percent of black students and 1.1 percent of Latino students were. * Well over half of all black and Latino students were admitted to either an educational option or a limited unscreened program, compared to roughly one in five white or Asian students. This is the second Measure of America report on on-time high school graduation in NYC. The first report, High School Graduation in New York City: Is Neighborhood Still Destiny? (2016), analyzed on-time high school graduation rates for high school students not by the schools they attend, but rather by the neighborhoods they call home. =Impact of the US Housing Crisis on the Racial Wealth Gap Across Generations, 2015= In the lead-up to the financial crisis, economic opportunity remained unequal across racial lines, but economic trends suggested that America was on a path toward narrowing the yawning wealth disparities between white and black families. Deeply rooted economic inequality, however, fueled some of the most harmful lending practices in the housing market, allowing financial institutions to engage in discriminatory and predatory lending that accelerated the financial collapse. Commissioned by the American Civil Liberties Union and drawing on a unique dataset, this report examines the likely effect of the financial crisis on the racial wealth gap for the next generation. What it uncovers is a tale of two recoveries: among families that owned homes, white households have started to rebound from the worst effects of the Great Recession while black households are still struggling to make up lost ground. The racial wealth gap is now on track to compound over time, a trend with urgent implications for the future of racial justice in America, and one that should inform policymaking strategies aimed at guaranteeing fair economic opportunities in the coming years. * By 2031, white wealth is forecast to be 31 percent below what it would have been without the Great Recession, while black wealth is down almost 40 percent.

After an infarction, an obvious complication is a second infarction, which may occur in the domain of another atherosclerotic coronary artery, or in the same zone if there are any live cells left in the infarct. Post-myocardial complications occur after a period of ischemia, these changes can be seen in gross tissue changes and microscopic changes.Muscle Tissue. In: Mescher AL. eds. Junqueira‚Äôs Basic Histology: Text and Atlas, 15e New York, NY: McGraw- Hill Necrosis begins after 20 minutes of an infarction. Under 4 hours of ischemia, there are no gross or microscopic changes noted.Kumar, V., Abbas, A. K., & Aster, J. C. (2015). Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease (Ninth edition.). Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier/Saunders. From 4-24 hours coagulative necrosis begins to be seen, which is characterized by the removal of dead cardiomyocytes through heterolysis and the nucleus through karyorrhexis, karyolysis, and pyknosis. On gross examination, coagulative necrosis shows darkened discoloration of the infarcted tissue. The most common complication during this period is arrhythmias. Day 1-7 is marked by the inflammatory phase. Days 1-3 are marked by ‚Äúacute inflammation‚Äù, in which neutrophils infiltrate the ischemic tissue. A major complication during this period is fibrinous pericarditis, particularly in transmural ventricular wall damage (an infarct that impacted all 3 layers of the heart, the epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium). This leads to inflammation, such as swelling, leading to rubbing of the heart on the pericardium. Day 4 through 7 are marked by ‚Äúchronic inflammation‚Äù, on histology macrophages will be seen infiltrating the tissue. The role of these macrophages is the removal of necrotic myocytes. However, these cells are directly involved in the weakening of the tissue, leading to complications such as a ventricular free wall rupture, intraventricular septum rupture, or a papillary muscle rupture. At a gross anatomical level, this staged is marked by a yellow pallor. Weeks 1-3 are marked on histology by abundant capillaries, and fibroblast infiltration. Fibroblasts start replacing the lost cardiomyocytes with collagen type 1 and leads to the granulation of tissue. After several weeks fibrosis occurs and heavy collagen formation. Collagen is not as strong or compliant as the myocardium that it replaced, this instability could lead to a ventricular aneurysm, and the stasis of blood in an aneurysm can lead to a mural thrombus. A rarer complication that also occurs during this time is Dressler's syndrome and is thought to have autoimmune origins. Leonard S. Lilly. Pathophysiology Of Heart Disease : a Collaborative Project of Medical Students and Faculty. Philadelphia :Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2003. Congestive heart failure 3D still showing normal heart vs heart failure. A myocardial infarction may compromise the function of the heart as a pump for the circulation, a state called heart failure. There are different types of heart failure; left- or right-sided (or bilateral) heart failure may occur depending on the affected part of the heart, and it is a low-output type of failure. If one of the heart valves is affected, this may cause dysfunction, such as mitral regurgitation in the case of left-sided coronary occlusion that disrupts the blood supply of the papillary muscles. The incidence of heart failure is particularly high in patients with diabetes and requires special management strategies. Myocardial rupture Myocardial rupture is most common three to seven days after myocardial infarction, commonly of small degree, but may occur one day to three weeks later. In the modern era of early revascularization and intensive pharmacotherapy as treatment for MI, the incidence of myocardial rupture is about 1% of all MIs. This may occur in the free walls of the ventricles, the septum between them, the papillary muscles, or less commonly the atria. Rupture occurs because of increased pressure against the weakened walls of the heart chambers due to heart muscle that cannot pump blood out effectively. The weakness may also lead to ventricular aneurysm, a localized dilation or ballooning of the heart chamber. Risk factors for myocardial rupture include completion of infarction (no revascularization performed), female sex, advanced age, and a lack of a previous history of myocardial infarction. In addition, the risk of rupture is higher in individuals who are revascularized with a thrombolytic agent than with PCI. The shear stress between the infarcted segment and the surrounding normal myocardium (which may be hypercontractile in the post-infarction period) makes it a nidus for rupture. Rupture is usually a catastrophic event that may result a life-threatening process known as cardiac tamponade, in which blood accumulates within the pericardium or heart sac, and compresses the heart to the point where it cannot pump effectively. Rupture of the intraventricular septum (the muscle separating the left and right ventricles) causes a ventricular septal defect with shunting of blood through the defect from the left side of the heart to the right side of the heart, which can lead to right ventricular failure as well as pulmonary overcirculation. Rupture of the papillary muscle may also lead to acute mitral regurgitation and subsequent pulmonary edema and possibly even cardiogenic shock. Arrhythmia A 12 lead electrocardiogram showing ventricular tachycardia. Since the electrical characteristics of the infarcted tissue change (see pathophysiology section), arrhythmias are a frequent complication. The re-entry phenomenon may cause rapid heart rates (ventricular tachycardia and even ventricular fibrillation), and ischemia in the electrical conduction system of the heart may cause a complete heart block (when the impulse from the sinoatrial node, the normal cardiac pacemaker, does not reach the heart chambers). Pericarditis As a reaction to the damage of the heart muscle, inflammatory cells are attracted. The inflammation may reach out and affect the heart sac. This is called pericarditis. In Dressler's syndrome, this occurs several weeks after the initial event. If pericarditis were to persist, pericardial effusion may also occur which could in turn lead to cardiac tamponade if not properly treated. Cardiogenic shock A complication that may occur in the acute setting soon after a myocardial infarction or in the weeks following is cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock is defined as a hemodynamic state in which the heart cannot produce enough of a cardiac output to supply an adequate amount of oxygenated blood to the tissues of the body. While the data on performing interventions on individuals with cardiogenic shock is sparse, trial data suggests a long-term mortality benefit in undergoing revascularization if the individual is less than 75 years old and if the onset of the acute myocardial infarction is less than 36 hours and the onset of cardiogenic shock is less than 18 hours. If the patient with cardiogenic shock is not going to be revascularized, aggressive hemodynamic support is warranted, with insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump if not contraindicated. If diagnostic coronary angiography does not reveal a culprit blockage that is the cause of the cardiogenic shock, the prognosis is poor.

The operation took place during the final stage of the Balkans Campaign. On September 15, a combined force of Serbian, French and Greek troops attacked the Bulgarian-held trenches in Dobro Pole (\\"Good Field\\"), at the time part of the Kingdom of Serbia (present day North Macedonia). The assault and the preceding artillery preparation had devastating effects on Bulgarian morale, eventually leading to mass desertions. On September 18, a second Entente formation assaulted the Bulgarian positions in the vicinity of Lake Doiran. Effectively employing machine gun and artillery fire the Bulgarians managed to stall the Allied advance on the Doiran sector. However the collapse of the front at Dobro Pole forced the Bulgarians to withdraw from Doiran. The Allies pursued the German 11th Army and the Bulgarian 1st Army, while pushing deeper into Vardar Macedonia. By 29 September, the Allies had captured the former HQ of Skopje, thus endangering the remnants of the 11th Army. The parallel development of the anti-monarchist Radomir Rebellion forced Bulgaria to sign the Armistice of Salonica and withdraw from the war. The treaty included the full capitulation of the 11th Army, bringing the final tally of Bulgarian and German prisoners to 77,000 and granting the Allies 500 artillery pieces. The Bulgarian downfall turned the strategic and operational balance of the war against the Central Powers. The Macedonian Front was brought to an end at noon on 30 September, when the ceasefire came into effect. Prelude Bulgarian prisoners of war captured at Skra. The 28 June 1914, assassination of Austro-Hungarian heir presumptive Archduke Franz Ferdinand precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia. The conflict quickly attracted the involvement of all major European countries, pitting the Central Powers against the Entente coalition and starting World War I. Serbia was defeated during the autumn 1915 phase of the Serbian Campaign, prompting France and Britain to transfer troops from the Gallipoli Campaign to Greek Macedonia. The Macedonian front was thus established in an effort to support the remnants of the Serbian army to conquer Vardar Macedonia. On 17 August 1916, in the Struma Offensive Bulgaria invaded Greece, easily conquering all Greek territory east of the Struma, since the Greek Army was ordered not to resist by the pro- German King Constantine. The surrender of territory recently won with difficulty in the Second Balkan War of 1913 was the last straw for many supporters of Liberal Party politician Eleftherios Venizelos. With Allied assistance, they launched a coup which secured Thessaloniki and most of Greek Macedonia, causing the National Schism. In June 1917, the Venizelists gained full control of the country, immediately declaring war on the Central Powers and joining the Allied Army of the Orient operating on the Balkan Front. The Greek entry into the war along with the 24 division reinforcements that the Army had received in the spring of the same year had created a strategic advantage for the Entente. On 30 May 1918, the Allies launched an offensive on the heavily fortified Skra salient, commencing the battle of Skra-di-Legen. Utilizing the cover of heavy artillery a Franco-Hellenic force made a rapid push into the enemy trenches, conquering Skra and the surrounding system of fortifications. Greek casualties amounted to 434‚Äì440 killed in action, 154‚Äì164 missing in action and 1,974‚Äì2,220 wounded, France lost approximately 150 men killed or injured. A total of 1,782 soldiers of the Central Powers became prisoners of war, including a small number of German engineers and artillery specialists that served in Bulgarian units; considerable amounts of military equipment also fell into Entente hands. The plan for a Bulgarian counterattack against Skra remained unfulfilled as the Bulgarian soldiers refused to take part in the operation. Both the Greek and the French press used the opportunity to extol the efforts of the Greek army, favorably influencing the Greek mobilization. The fall of Skra prompted Bulgarian prime minister Vasil Radoslavov to resign on 21 June 1918. Aleksandar Malinov who assumed office immediately afterwards pursued secret negotiations with Britain, offering Bulgaria's exit from the war with the condition that Bulgaria fully retain eastern Macedonia. However, British prime minister David Lloyd George rejected the proposal, assuring the Greek ambassador in London Ioannis Gennadius, that Britain would not act against Greek interests. In late July 1918, Bulgarian commander-in-chief Nikola Zhekov sent German Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg a message regarding a rumored Entente offensive, and detailed Bulgaria's inability to adequately defend the Vardar portion of the front. Zhekov requested that Germany immediately reinforce the Balkan Front, hinting that Austria-Hungary would also be required to strengthen its positions in Albania. On 17 August, Hindenburg pledged to provide Bulgaria with support once the situation on other front permits it. Hindenburg's reluctance to support Bulgaria was also manifested by the early September redeployment of the last German J√§ger battalion stationed in Macedonia back into Germany. The Bulgarians, using information from escaped prisoners of war, determined that Entente forces would engage in hostile actions west of lake Ohrid, in Monastir, Dobro Pole or Human. On 27 August, the 2nd and 3rd Bulgarian Divisions stationed at Dobro Pole were ordered to make emergency preparations, as new evidence indicated a frontal assault on Dobro Pole along with a secondary attack on Human. By 7 September, Dobro Pole was reinforced by one machine gun company, six battalions and ten heavy howitzers, the head of Army Group Scholtz General Friedrich von Scholtz then stated that the defensive measures made the defense of the front feasible. Scholtz had failed to take into account the departure of Bulgarian chief of staff Nikola Zhekov and his subsequent replacement by Georgi Todorov. Widespread insubordination and desertions also plagued the Bulgarian troops who refused to participate in fortification works; poor rations and fatigue contributed to the low morale. A day prior to the Entente offensive, General Louis Franchet d'Esp√®rey laid out the final plan for the operation. The first phase consisted of a combined Franco-Serbian attack on the positions of the 2nd and 3rd Bulgarian Divisions, which was expected to create a breach of the front line in the area of Dobro Pole, while also posing a danger to the Bulgarian supply lines on river Vardar. The Dobro Pole (\\"Good Field\\") peak dominated the region, providing excellent observation points for the defenders. Dobro Pole was surrounded by a well-developed system of trenches which, in combination with the rough terrain, made the area impassable for wheeled transport. Dobro Pole was, however, lower and less steep than the mountains on other parts of the front that averaged . A second Anglo-Franco-Hellenic force would then attack the Bulgarian 1st Army between the Vardar river and Lake Doiran, preventing it from forming new defensive positions in the area. The initial advance would allow the Arm√©e d'Orient to progress in support of other units first to Prilep, Disma and Borran. In the meantime, an Anglo-Hellenic force would strike Mount Belasica, occupying the Rupel Pass. The Doiran sector had previously been subject to two major Entente offensives known as the First Battle of Doiran (August 1916) and Second Battle of Doiran (April‚ÄìMay 1917). Both engagements ended in decisive Bulgarian victories, forcing the Allies to limit their operations to small raids and harassing fire. Between 1916 and July 1918, Bulgarian defenses around Doiran underwent a period of considerable reorganization under the personal supervision of General Vladimir Vazov. The sector was divided into two defensive areas, protected by the Mountain Division and the 9th Infantry Division respectively. Bulgaria established combat security outposts at a distance of from the enemy trenches, while also reinforcing the defenses of the dominant Dub and Kala Tepe mountains. Similarly to Dobro Pole the defenses consisted of a series of mutually supporting trenches, with built in observation posts, machine gun positions and artillery pieces. D'Esp√®rey expected to march the Allied Army of the Orient through the towns of Demir Hisar, Rupel, Petrici, Blagusa, Gradec, ≈†tip and Belessa finally seizing Skopje. Units stationed at Katsania and Tetovo would prevent a Bulgarian flanking maneuver, while the main body of the force would widen the breach both in ≈†tip and Prilep. In case of a collapse of the front between Dobro Pole and Tzena, the Bulgarian 1st Army and the German 11th Army. Armies would either be annihilated or, in less favorable circumstances, perform an organised retreat to a new defensive line on river Crna. The prevention of such a retreat was to be achieved by a rapid, penetrating attack on Gradsko, Dren Planina and Visoka. Offensive =Battle of Dobro Pole= German soldiers bathing in the Crna river in 1918. At 8 a.m. on 14 September 1918, Entente forces commenced a 566-gun artillery barrage on enemy positions. Their aircraft also bombed enemy positions and strafed a 250-truck column moving towards Kozjak. On the same day, Scholtz sent Hindenburg a telegraph stating that The Bulgarian high command did not attempt to perform a spoiling attack as they lacked the necessary vehicles and pack animals. The barrage did not cause a significant number of casualties but severely affected the Bulgarian esprit de corps. On the night between 14 and 15 September, Franco- Serbian patrols reported that the artillery barrage had dealt sufficient damage to the barbed wire entanglements separating the trenches. At 5:30 a.m. on 15 September, the French 122nd and 17th (Colonial) Divisions struck Sokol, Dobro Pole, Kravitski Kamene and Kravitsa while the Serbian Shumadia Division assaulted Kamene and Veternik. The Greek Archipelago Division, 3rd Division and 4th Division under Panagiotis Gargalidis acted as a link between the Serbian and French troops without entering combat. The offensive immediately caused a wave of mass desertion among the Bulgarian units; the remaining infantrymen and artillery squadrons were not able to hold their ground. During the course of the battle, the 122nd Division broke into two columns and suffered heavy casualties. The left column managed to reach a position located from Sokol at 6:30 a.m. and take the peak at the end of the day. At 16:00 p.m., the right column captured Dobro Pole after rushing a segment of steep terrain. The 17th Division seized Kravitsa at 7:00 a.m., suppressing the last signs of resistance. Two Franco-Greek Regiments attempted to storm Zborsko but were pushed back in the ensuing counterattack, as powerful pockets of resistance between the Sousnitsa and Bigrut streams facilitated its defense. Greek units then focused on Sousnitsa the fall of which created an opening in the Bulgarian rear and put the surrounding units to flight. Using dispersed bluffs as cover, soldiers of the Shumadia Division took over Veternik, Kamene and the western part of a nearby mountain range with considerable difficulty. Elements of the same unit successfully flanked Kravitski Kamene while the 17th Division was engaging in a frontal assault. At 16:00 p.m., the Serbian 1st Army's thrust on Sokol failed to produce intended results. An attack later that night did secure the peak. The two French divisions were then ordered to remain in position while the Serbian Timok and Yugoslav Divisions moved forward. By the end of the day, Bulgaria lost approximately 40‚Äì50 percent of the 12,000 soldiers involved in the battle, including 3,000 prisoners of war, 2,689 dead and 50 out of the initial 158 artillery pieces. Entente casualties amounted to 1,700 Frenchmen and 200 Serbians killed in action. On the morning of 16 September, the Serbians overran the Kozjak mountain range and the Golo Bilo peak. They were joined by the 35th Greek Regiment which crossed the Poroi river and later marching on Topolets. At 11:00 a.m., Franco-Hellenic units stormed Zborsko for a second time and were met by heavy artillery and machine gun fire. The attack was rebuffed with the loss of 158 Greeks and roughly the same number of French lives and attempts to take the area were suspended. ≈Ωivojin Mi≈°iƒá's 1st Army and the Arm√©e d'Orient performed a night attack on the Grade≈°nica fortified zone, suppressing the defenders. The 1st Division Group moved into a position on the Poroi river north of Brahovo in conjunction with the Timok Division. By the night of 16 September, the gap in what formerly constituted the front-line had extended to in width and in depth. The Allied command ordered its air department to continue attacking all bridges on the river Vardar. At 4.00 a.m. on 17 September, Hellenic components of the 1st Division Group raided mount Preslap, a key position housing Bulgarian artillery. The Greeks rapidly descended from Golo Bilo and then began climbing the cliffs of Preslap with their bare hands. The Preslap garrison proceeded to abandon their positions and retreat eastwards. Having lost their artillery cover forces at Zborsko followed their comrades in retreat. The Timok Division conquered Topolets and advanced towards Studena Voda and Preslap while the Morava and Yugoslav Divisions overran Koutskov Kamene. At the same time, the Drina and Danube Divisions seized Grade≈°nica along with the Poltsista and Besistsa peaks, then halted at Melinitsa. On 18 September, the 11th French Colonial Division and the 6th Greek Regiment occupied the villages of Zovik, Staravina and , approaching towards the bridge on Crna. An Entente air raid destroyed another bridge north of Razim Bey. Bulgarian forces failed at putting a stop to the Allied offensive, abandoning their wounded and large quantities of military equipment. By the end of the day, Allied troops had advanced into enemy territory while also seizing locales of strategic importance that would later enable them to continue pushing deeper into Vardar Macedonia. =Battle of Doiran= On 16 September, the Allies commenced a 232 gun and 24 howitzer artillery barrage on the Bulgarian positions between Vardar and Doiran. Bulgaria responded in kind, with the artillery duel continuing during the following two days. On the night of 17‚Äì18 September, Bulgarian positions were targeted by nine salvos of gas shells, however the attack failed to produce any considerable effect due to the preceding arrival of new gas masks and the adequate training of the defenders. At 5.00 a.m. on 18 September, the British XII Corps executed a pincer maneuver on the 9th Bulgarian Division, while the Greek Serres Division and the 83rd British Brigade assaulted the Bulgarian trenches to the west, taking numerous prisoners. On the north‚Äìeast direction the Crete Division and the 28th British Division advanced between the lake and Belasica, after clearing out the Bulgarian outpost line. The 26th British Division seized a number of Bulgarian security outposts but was quickly repulsed by heavy artillery fire and counter-attacks that recaptured the lost ground. It was not until 7:20 a.m., when the Serres Division managed to make limited gains on the flanks having suffered numerous casualties and lost momentum. In the meantime the 22nd British Division overtook two central trenchlines. Supported by concentrated artillery and machine gun fire the 3rd Bulgarian Brigade pushed the Allies back, by the end of the day the sum of the Entente forces were back at their starting point, the British 67th Brigade having lost 65 percent of its soldiers. The offensive was resumed at 4.00 a.m. on 19 September after a night of heavy shelling. The operation involved the British 77th and 65th Brigades, the 2nd French Zouaves Regiment, along with the Serres and 14th Greek Divisions. Following five hours of intense fighting the Allies managed to overrun the town of Dojran, mount Kala Tepe and Teton Hill, with the Pip Ridge and mount Dub remaining in Bulgarian hands. In the aftermath of the engagement the Allied command found itself to be unable to make any further offensive operations on the Doiran sector as it no longer possessed an adequate reserve of manpower. Bulgaria lost a total of 518 dead, 998 wounded, and 1,210 captured. Greek casualties amounted to 503 killed, 2,286 injured and 615 missing, with the British suffering 3,871 dead and wounded. =Subsequent operations= On 20 September, the 17th and 122nd French Colonial Divisions along with the 1st Serbian Army crossed river Crna. News of a breakthrough at Dobro Pole prompted the defenders of Doiran to abandon their positions and rush to the defense of their homeland, in order to prevent a future occupation by the Entente. On 21 September, the Allies became aware of the Bulgarian withdrawal after observing a series of fires and munition dump explosions on the Bulgarian positions, a pursuit by the British XII Corps was launched immediately. The Serbian advanced guard approached Krivolak, thus creating a wedge between the 1st Bulgarian and 11th German Armies in an effort to force the latter to retire towards Albania. The 2nd Bulgarian Army headed towards the Kosturino Pass avoiding direct engagement with the Allies. At 17:30 p.m. on 22 September, the Italian 35th Division under General Ernesto Mombelli joined the offensive, seizing Hill 1050 stronghold from the 302nd German Division and taking 150 prisoners. Fighting took place in Kanatlarci and along the Monastir‚ÄìPrilep road, in Cepik, Kalabak and Topolƒçani as the Allies continued to advance towards Prilep. At 14:00 p.m. on 23 September, General Louis Franchet d'Esp√®rey announced that the initial plan of the operation was to be modified. The Italians were ordered to strike Kiƒçevo with the aim of preventing the enemy forces stationed at Monastir from reaching the railroad hub in Uskub, the 11th Colonial French Division was instead tasked with securing Prilep. Half an hour later the French entered Prilep, to the east Franco‚ÄìSerbian columns marched on ≈†tip, Veles, Brod and through the Peristeri mountain range. On 24 September, Bulgarian infantry supported by artillery halted the advance of the Italian cavalry between Kru≈°evo and the Buchin bridge. At 17:00 p.m., an Italo‚ÄìSerbian assault resulted in the fall of Stepanci. On 25 September, the Sicilia Brigade captured Kru≈°evo and the surrounding peaks after being reinforced by the 11th Colonial French Division. The Quadruple Alliance High Command set Uskub as the rallying point for its forces in Vardar Macedonia, intending to later strengthen them with units from Germany and Austria. The 30th and 156th French Divisions occupied Prevaletz and Drvenik respectively. On 25 September, a band of Bulgarian deserters who had previously fled from Dobro Pole arrived at Kyustendil, looting the city and putting the Bulgarian High Command to flight. The mass of retreating Bulgarian mutineers then converged on the railway center of Radomir in Bulgaria, just from the capital city of Sofia. On the evening of 26 September, Italian cavalry wrestled Goloznica from a Saxon infantry unit, later entering Drenovo where it received information of a Bulgarian withdrawal from Veles. On 27 September, the leaders of the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union took control of these troops and proclaimed the establishment of the Bulgarian Republic. About rebellious troops threatened Sofia the following day, in what came to be known the Radomir Rebellion. The Serbian Second Army having previously taken ≈†tip, entered Veles, Kochana and Grlena. Uskub was protected by a garrison of six and a half battalions, four armored trains and four artillery batteries split between a mountain range south of the city and a position north of lake Kaplan. Between 27‚Äì28 September, the 1st and 4th French Colonial Regiments made their way through Drachevo and Pagaruza, successfully bypassing any sentries located in the gap between the two Bulgarian formations that protected Uskub. At 4:00 a.m. on 29 September, French General laid out the plan for the final stage of the offensive, the attack on Uskub. The assault was launched an hour later, French spahi utilized thick fog to advance on mount Vodna, however they were forced to regroup after facing heavy resistance. A pincer movement by the 1st Colonial Regiment created a bridgehead at river Vardar, while the 4th Colonial Regiment seized Lisici village. At 9:00 a.m., the spahis overtook Vodna, later shifting their attention towards the Kalkandelen road. The 1st Colonial Regiment joined the spahis, opening machine gun fire on the retreating 61st German Corps and causing numerous casualties. At 11:00 a.m., the French entered Uskub, detaining 220 Bulgarian and 139 German soldiers, while also seizing 5 guns and large amounts of ordnance. Aftermath French military cemetery in Skopje. Under those chaotic circumstances a Bulgarian delegation arrived in Thessaloniki to ask for an armistice. On 29 September, the Bulgarians were granted the Armistice of Salonica by General d'Esperey. The Bulgarian downfall turned the strategic and operational balance of the war against the Central Powers. The Macedonian Front was brought to an end at noon on 30 September, when the ceasefire came into effect. The treaty included the full capitulation of the 11th German Army, bringing the final tally of German and Bulgarian prisoners to 77,000 and granting the Allies 500 artillery pieces. The Radomir Rebellion was put down, by Bulgarian forces, as of the 2 October, while Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria abdicated and went into exile the following day. New balance was best described by German Emperor Wilhelm II in his telegram to Bulgarian Tsar Ferdinand I: ‚ÄúDisgraceful! 62,000 Serbs decided the war!\\". On 29 September 1918, the German Supreme Army Command informed Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Imperial Chancellor Count Georg von Hertling, that the military situation facing Germany was hopeless . The British Army headed east towards the European side of the Ottoman Empire, while the French and Serbian forces continued north. The British Army neared Constantinople and, without a force capable to stopping the advance, the Ottoman government asked for an armistice (the Armistice of Mudros) on 26 October. In Serbia, \\"Desperate Frankie\\" (as the British nicknamed d'Esperey) continued to advance and the Serbo-French Army re-captured the country, overrunning several weak German divisions that tried to block its push near Ni≈°. On 3 November, Austria-Hungary was forced to sign an armistice on the Italian Front ending the war there. On 10 November, d'Esperey's army crossed the Danube river and was poised to enter the Hungarian heartland. At the request of the French general, Count Mih√°ly K√°rolyi, leading the Hungarian government, came to Belgrade and signed another armistice.

These interracial groups were radical expressions of women's political ideals, and they led directly to voting rights activism before and after the Civil War. Throughout the 19th century, African-American women like Harriet Forten Purvis, Mary Ann Shadd Cary, and Frances Ellen Watkins Harper worked on two fronts simultaneously: reminding African-American men and white women that Black women needed legal rights, especially the right to vote. After the Civil War, women's rights activists disagreed about whether to support ratification of the 15th Amendment, which provided voting rights regardless of race, but which did not explicitly enfranchise women. The resulting split in the women's movement marginalized African-American women, who nonetheless continued their suffrage activism. By the 1890s, the women's suffrage movement had become increasingly racist and exclusionary, and African-American women organized separately through local women's clubs and the National Association of Colored Women. Women won the vote in dozens of states in the 1910s, and African- American women became a powerful voting block. The struggle for the vote did not end with the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, which expanded voting rights substantially, but did not address the racial terrorism that prevented African-Americans in southern states from voting, regardless of sex. Women like Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker, and Diane Nash continued the fight for voting rights for all, culminating in the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Origins of the movement  The origins of the women's suffrage movement are tied to the Abolitionist movement. Upper-class white women in particular first articulated their own oppression in marriage and the private sphere using the metaphor of slavery, and they first developed a political consciousness by mobilizing in support of abolitionism.Davis, Angela. Women, Race and Class. Random House, 1981. Print. Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Maria Weston Chapman were among the early female abolitionists. The Abolitionist cause provided women who were previously bound to their roles as wives and mothers the opportunity to publicly challenge sexism and learn how to politically engage as activists, though the African American women's suffrage movement was a different vein of women's suffrage, and one could even argue a different movement altogether. Abolitionists who headed the Equal Rights Association like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony had a primarily white agenda. After the Civil War it became clear that black and white women had different views of why the right to vote was essential. Unlike white suffragists, Black women sought the ballot for themselves and their men to empower black communities besieged by the reign of racial terror that erupted after Emancipation in the late 1800s.  The movement splits  The racism that defined the early twentieth century made it so black women were oppressed from every side: first, for their status as women, and then again for their race. Many politically engaged African- American women were primarily invested in matters of racial equality, with suffrage later materializing as a secondary goal. The Seneca Falls Convention, widely lauded as the first women‚Äôs rights convention, is often considered the precursor to the racial schism within the women‚Äôs suffrage movement; the Seneca Falls Declaration put forth a political analysis of the condition of upper-class, married women, but did not address the struggles of working-class white women or black women. Well into the twentieth century, a pattern emerged of segregated political activism, as black and white women organized separately due to class and racial tensions within the overall movement, and a fundamental difference in movement goals and political consciousness. Black women engaged in multi-pronged activism, as they did not often separate the goal of obtaining the franchise from other goals, and wide-scale racism added to the urgency of their more multi-faceted activism.Goodier, Susan, and Karen Pastorello. \\"A Fundamental Component: Suffrage for African American Women.\\" Women Will Vote: Winning Suffrage in New York State, Ithaca/London: Cornell University Press, 2017, pp. 71‚Äì91. JSTOR, . Most black women who supported the expansion of the franchise sought to better the lives of black women alongside black men and children, which radically set them apart from their white counterparts. While white women were focused on obtaining the franchise, black women sought the betterment of their communities overall, rather than their individual betterment exclusively as women. In Women, Race and Class, Angela Davis explains that \\"black women were equal to their men in the oppression they suffered‚Ä¶and they resisted slavery with a passion equal to their men's\\", which highlights the source of their more holistic activism. Following the civil war, many African-American women struggled to keep their interests at the forefront of the political sphere, as many reformers tended to assume in their rhetoric assuming \\"black to be male and women to be white\\".  Marginalizing African-American women  In 1890, two rival organizations, the National Woman Suffrage Association and the American Woman Suffrage Association, merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).) As NAWSA began gaining support for its cause, its members realized that the exclusion of African-American women would gain greater support, resulting in the adoption of a more narrow view of women's suffrage than had been previously asserted. NAWSA focused on enfranchisement solely for white women. African-American women began experiencing the \\"Anti-Black\\" women's suffrage movement. The National Woman Suffrage Association considered the Northeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs to be a liability to the association due to Southern white women's attitudes toward black women getting the vote. Southern whites feared African Americans gaining more political advantage and thus power; African-American women voters would help to achieve this change. The women's suffrage movement began with women such as Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth, and it progressed to women like Ida B. Wells, Mary Church Terrell, Ella Baker, Rosa Parks, Angela Davis, and many others. All of these women played very important roles, such as contributing to the growing progress and effort to end African-American women's disenfranchisement. These women were discriminated against, abused, and raped by white southerners and northerners, yet they remained strong and persistent, and that strength has been passed down from generation to generation. It is still carried on in African-American families today. \\"African American women, have been political activists for their entire history on the American continent but long denied the right to vote and hold office, have resorted to nontraditional politics.\\" After her arrest in 1970, \\"[Angela] Davis became a political prisoner. National and international protests to free Angela were mobilized around the world. During the two years that she spent in prison, Davis read, wrote essays on injustices, and prepared as co-counsel for her own defense. Eventually, Davis was released on bail in 1972 and later acquitted of all criminal charges at her jury trial.\\"Barnett, Bernice McNair. Race, Gender & Class. 2003, Vol. 10, Issue 3, pp. 9‚Äì22. (Davis, 1971b; 1974). = Creation of the National Association of Colored Women = Banner with the National Association of Colored Women‚Äôs Clubs' motto. Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture The American Women's Suffrage movement began in the north as a middle-class white woman's movement with most of their members were educated white women primarily from Boston, New York, Maine, and the Northeast. Attempts were made by the National Women's Suffrage Association (NWSA) to include working-class women, as well as black suffragists. In 1866 the American Equal Rights Association was formed with the belief that everyone regardless of race or sex should be given the right to vote. During this time period a division was forming among the women's movement. The 14th Amendment was being proposed and black males were on the cusp of receiving the right to vote. The NSWA held a convention to discuss how to go forward and the women were divided on the issue. Some women didn't want to risk losing the chance for black males to get the right to vote, and figured that the women would get their turn. They saw this proposed amendment as a victory of sorts. Other women, including Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, were angered by this decision and felt that it was not good enough, and that women black or white, should not be excluded from the vote. The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were eventually passed by Congress and women were still not granted the right to vote. As time went on the leaders of the National Women's Suffrage Association began to see African-American Suffrage and White Suffrage as different issues. The reasons for this change in ideals varies, but in the 1890s younger women began to take the leadership roles and people such as Stanton and Anthony were no longer in charge. Another reason for the change in ideals among the movement was the growing \\"white supremacy\\" thinking of women entering the movement from the south. Now with dissention and disagreement among the NWSA, African-American women left and banded together to form their own organizations.Kolmer, E. (1972). \\"Nineteenth Century Women's Rights Movement\\", Negro History Bulletin, 35(8), 178.Taylor, U. (1998). \\"The historical evolution of black feminist theory and praxis\\". Journal of Black Studies, 29(2), 234+. In June 1892 the Colored Women's League (CWL) was founded in Washington D.C. Under their president, Helen Appo Cook, the CWL fought for black suffrage and held night classes. A Boston-based group under the leadership of Margaret Murray Washington and Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin called the National Federation of Afro-American Women joined the Colored Women's League out of Washington D.C. In 1896, both groups combined to form the National Association of Colored Women under the leadership of Mary Church Terrell. Terrell was a college educated woman and was named the first president. This group did many things to contribute to the betterment of black women, as well as many other smaller groups who are not named.  The \\"educated suffragist\\"  The NAWSA's movement marginalized many African- American women and through this effort was developed the idea of the \\"educated suffragist.\\" This was the notion that being educated was an important prerequisite for being allowed the right to vote. Since many African-American women were uneducated, this notion meant exclusion from the right to vote. This movement was prevalent in the South but eventually gained momentum in the North as well. African-American women were not deterred by the rising opposition and became even more aggressive in their campaign to find equality with men and other women. As a result, many women mobilized during this time period and worked to get African-American women involved and included in the suffrage movement, by focusing on the education of the African-American community and women on local government issues. In 1913, the Alpha Suffrage Club was founded, with Ida B. Wells as one of the co-founders and leaders, this is believed to be the first African-American women's suffrage association in the United States. The group worked in publishing the Alpha Suffrage Record newspaper to canvas neighborhoods and voice political opinions. One of the many black women focused on advancing literary \\"artistic and intellectual development\\" among African Americans in the north was Bettiola Heloise Fortson. Fortson had been an active member of various women's clubs in the Chicago area and she founded her own women's literary studies club, the University Society of Chicago. All the African-American women who participated in this important struggle against their exclusion from the women's suffrage movement waited seventy years or more to see the fruits of their labour.  Issues in exercising the vote  After the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, African-American women, particularly those inhabiting Southern states, still faced a number of barriers. At first, African-American women in the North were easily able to register to vote, and quite a few became actively involved in politics. One such woman was Annie Simms Banks who was chosen to serve as a delegate to Kentucky‚Äôs Republican Party convention in March 1920. White southerners took notice of African-American female activists organizing themselves for suffrage, and after the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, African-American women's voter registration in Florida was higher than white women's. African-American women were targeted by a number of disenfranchisement methods. These included having to wait in line for up to twelve hours to register to vote, pay head taxes, and undergo new tests. One of the new tests required that African-American women read and interpret the Constitution before being deemed eligible to vote. In the South, African- American women faced the most severe obstacles to voting. These obstacles included bodily harm and fabricated charges designed to land them in jail if they attempted to vote. This treatment of African-American women in the South continued up until the 1960s.

Organisation & Development of the Nazi Party, Volume 1, Peter Lang, 2004, p. 252 An early Nazi Party member, he was farmer by profession and organised the first training course for Nazi farmers in 1926. Willikens was a member of the Reichstag from electoral constituency 16 (South Hanover-Brunswick), elected as one of the first 12 Nazi deputies in 1928 and retaining his seat until the fall of the Third Reich.Datenbank der deutschen Parlamentsabgeordneten In 1930 he was appointed deputy chairman of Agrarpolitischer Apparat, Agricultural Affairs Bureau of the NSDAP and also chaired the Agrarian League.M√ºhlberger, Hitler's Voice, p. 349 His appointment to the national executive of the Reichslandbund in 1930 was the first time that the highly conservative group - up to that point firmly linked to the German National People's Party - had given a position of influence to a Nazi.Richard Bessel & E.J.

Kershaw argued that the speech recognised the aloofness of Hitler's charismatic leadership and thus encouraged officials to second-guess Hitler's wishes and act accordingly. Kershaw suggests that Adolf Eichmann's rise from minor functionary to a leading role in the SS was built on this principle of \\"working towards the F√ºhrer\\".Ian Kershaw, Mosh√© Lewin, Stalinism and Nazism: Dictatorships in Comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, pp. 104-6 Indeed, such was Kershaw's use of Willikens' phrase that his tribute book even bore it as a title.Anthony McElligott, Tim Kirk, Ian Kershaw, Working Towards the F√ºhrer: Essays in Honour of Sir Ian Kershaw, Manchester University Press, 2003 The speech itself was made in Berlin on 21 February 1934 to representatives of the regional agriculture ministries.Ian Kershaw, Hitler 1889-1936: Hubris, Penguin Books, 1999, p. 529 References External links * 1893 births 1961 deaths People from Goslar (district) Nazi Party politicians Members of the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic Members of the Reichstag of Nazi Germany German farmers ","title":"Werner Willikens"},{"id":"29083460","text":"Vamping is a 1984 American drama film about a down-on-his-luck saxophonist who agrees to help rob the home of a rich widow, then unexpectedly falls for the woman.

First Nations saw the law as an instrument of intolerance and injustice. \\"Second only to the taking of land without extinguishing Indian title; the outlawing of the potlatch can be seen as the extreme to which Euro-Canadian society used its dominance against its aboriginal subjects in British Columbia.\\" Though often ignored and circumvented, the ban remained in Canadian legal codes until 1951, when Section 149 was deleted from a revision of the Indian Act. Arrests for charges under the Act were few until 1921, when a raid on the village of Memkumlis held by Chief Dan Cranmer saw the arrest and charges laid against 45 people; of these 22 were given suspended sentences (three were remanded on appeal) and 20 men and women sent to Oakalla Prison in Burnaby. The sentences were two months for first offenders and three months for second offenders. History Potlatch, which means \\"to give\\" or \\"a gift\\" in the Chinook Jargon,\\"The Potlatch: On the Suppression of the Potlatch\\", Story of the Masks website, U'mista Cultural Centre became adapted to refer to \\"the different ceremonies among [the] many nations of the Pacific Northwest that ... [include] feasting, dancing and giving gifts to all in attendance\\". It is also described somewhat more completely by The Story of the Masks website from the U'mista Cultural Centre in Alert Bay as \\"The potlatch refers to the ceremony where families gather and names are given, births are announced, marriages are conducted, and where families mourn the loss of a loved one. The potlatch is also the ceremony where a chief will pass on his rights and privileges to his eldest son.\\" The British Columbia Indian Office, specifically the Indian Commissioner, I. W. Powell, had found the native peoples to be rich and hardy, but also found they appeared as if they were poor. This finding led to further research on the subject of potlatches where it was found that to the Indigenous peoples of the region, the Potlatch was a great institution. It encouraged people to give away their earnings and possessions (including slaves). In exchange, the giver would receive a great deal of respect and be seen as honourable to his tribe and others. However, Canadian Prime Minister John A. Macdonald did not see this tradition as valuable or appropriate and, under the guise of unifying the Dominion of Canada, encouraged the government to lay \\"an iron hand on the shoulders of the [native] people\\" by restricting some of their non-essential, inappropriate rituals and leading them towards what he perceived as a \\"healthier\\" European mindset. Work thus began on an amendment to the Indian Act of 1880. Some criticized the idea, such as James Benjamin McCullagh in his essay on the tribal lifestyle of the indigenous peoples of Canada, \\"The Indian Potlatch\\".McCullagh, J. B. \\"The Indian potlatch\\": substance of a paper read before C.M.S. annual conference at Metlakatla, B.C., 1899. Canadiana.org. Toronto: Woman's Missionary Society of the Methodist Church, 1899. P. 9 In the third section of the Indian Act, signed on April 19, 1884, it was declared that: Not all non-Aboriginal people supported the ban. German-born Anthropologist Franz Boas not only opposed the ban; with the help of his First Nations assistant, he actually hosted one. Despite this, the ban was enacted, lasting until repealed in 1951. First Nations affected by the ban quickly saw the law as an instrument of injustice and intolerance. Reasons for the ban As Canada expanded, they adhered to a number of ideologies at the time, including converting their colonial subjects to Christianity. Seeing that the potlatch was at the heart of a non-Christian cultural system that opposed colonization, the potlatch was targeted by missionaries and colonial officials. Though there was an obvious political motivation for suppressing the potlatch, it was also very foreign to the norms of Protestant and mercantile Britons who found it hard to comprehend. They saw the ritualistic act of giving away nearly all of one's hard-earned possessions as a sign that the indigenous people were \\"unstable\\". Under the encouragement of the Indian Reserve Allotment Commission, the Indian Reserve Commission, and the Church of England, this behaviour was deemed possibly as a destabilizing force in the nation because it was so dramatically opposed to the values of the ideal \\"Christian capitalist society\\". Two major players in the Canadian potlatch ban were George Blenkinsop and Gilbert M. Sproat. Blenkinsop was a government agent commissioned to survey the lifestyle of the indigenous people in Barkley Sound. His findings on native culture were not encouraging to the Government, as he reported that there was \\"little hope of elevating ... [the natives] from their present state of degradation\\" without eliminating ceremonies such as the potlatch. Gilbert M. Sproat, on the other hand, was a \\"joint Federal- Provincial appointee to the Indian Reserve Commission\\". In this regard, he had worked closely with different native groups and tribes throughout British Columbia. In 1879, Sproat sent a strongly worded letter to Prime Minister John A. Macdonald. In the letter, Sproat declared that the potlatch ceremony was \\"the parent of numerous vices which eat out the heart of the [native] people\\", and reaffirmed the words of Blenkinsop by assuring the Prime Minister that \\"It is not possible that the Indians can acquire property, or can become industrious with any good result, while under the influence of ... [the potlatch]\\". Sproat's opinion was a commonly held one for the white employers of British Columbia. Euro-Canadians saw the potlatch as a pointless ceremony that did little but advance barbarity and retract the ability of the native peoples to advance themselves in society. Essentially, the potlatch was an important ritual to the natives that prevented assimilation into the melting pot the Euro-Canadian government sought to enforce. Employers found similar problems. Many of the aboriginal peoples of 1800s British Columbia were often motivated to work in order to gain wealth which would permit them to buy more items for potlatches, which would result in greater honour. This work was often seasonal in nature. This was in direct contrast to the agendas of many of the \\"white\\" employers who ultimately were frustrated by what they perceived to be the native \\"work ethic\\". According to John Lutz, written accounts of white employers were almost bipolar because of the indigenous peoples' seasonal working habits. This seasonal work permitted them to choose when they would work or when they would stay in their villages. Some employers deemed them \\"as 'indispensable' while [others] condemned their \\"unreliability\\" and \\"laziness\\". Missionaries of the northwestern regions of Canada also sent their opinions to the government. Most commonly they stated their arguments based on three fields: health, morality and economics. On the issue of health, the missionaries worried about the spread of disease amongst the large groups that gathered for potlatches, and critiqued the native peoples' recklessness. Specifically, they called out against the treatment of children, accusing those who attend potlatches of being responsible for the statistic claiming that \\"Six out of every ten [native] infants die\\" and that losing all of a family's possessions led to greater health risks to the family who hosted the potlatch. On the issue of morality, missionaries claimed that potlatches and financial requirements led wives and \\"maiden daughters\\" of those hosting to turn to prostitution to help their fathers gather wealth, as well as the consumption of alcohol. The issue of economics was simple in the notion that the native desire to give away all their goods was the opposite of the \\"Christian capitalist\\" values held in high esteem by Euro-Canadians. Opponents Aside from the Chiefs who were potlatching, there were other voices lent to oppose the imposition of a potlatch ban. The German-born anthropologist Franz Boas was familiar with the institution through his work on Vancouver Island. He opposed the potlatch ban and spoke out against repression of traditional religion. Results and legacy The first person to be charged under the law was a Sto:lo man from Chilliwack, Bill Uslick, who horrified Indian agent Frank Delvin by giving away all his goods, \\"practically left himself destitute.\\" He was arrested February 1, 1896 and sentenced to two months prison. Upon its release, the amendment to the Indian Act was found to be ineffectual due to a lack of enforcement. There are several recorded arrests in which the native peoples found loopholes in the edict and held potlatches in celebratory seasons, claiming to be doing what was \\"customary with white people during this season\\", and celebrating potlatches around holidays such as Christmas. Other groups made formal requests that they be able to host potlatches, but were refused. \\"The legal suppression of the potlatch became a symbol, in both native and white communities, of the Canadian treatment of British Columbia Indians.\\" The potlatch ban was never entirely effective, though it did significant cultural damage, and continued underground through the period of the ban in a number of places and ways. The potlatch ban and related banning of the sun dance and Coast Salish dancing occurred during the height of repressive colonial laws in Canada, lasting until 1951. After 1951, the Indian Act was amended, removing some of the more repressive measures, including the ban on the potlatch. After the ban was lifted, Nations on the coast began to openly potlatch again. The revival of open ceremony gained strength during the 1970s and 1980s, and it is once again widespread among many of the Nations that previously potlatched prior to the ban.

History The Meritorious Service Medal, along with the Hero's Medal, was first created in April 1951 by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army political director Du Ping in an effort to promote the unity of the Chinese armed forces during the Korean War.. The medals were conceived so that the common soldiers would follow the examples set by few selected role models. When the medal was first created, it was composed of four categories ‚Äî third, second, first and special class. The special class was later eliminated when the Chinese People's Liberation Army's (PLA) medal system formalized in 1988. Criteria and selection process According to the initial award criteria published in 1951, the medal can be awarded for any combat and noncombat achievements, as long as qualities such as \\"bravery in and skills in battle, acting in friendly unified, alert, earnest, lively way and [of] willing to help others in noncombat situations\\" were demonstrated.. Specific achievement that were required for the awards were also outlined in the criteria.. For combat situations, the achievements would be \\"those who destroy enemy obstacles, one bunker, one tank, or supply storage with explosive packages or grenade, or bringing down one enemy plane with anti- aircraft gun; those who are good at annihilating the enemy forces with light infantry weapons at no or small cost; those who sneak into enemy positions and capture an enemy officer, or a scout or guard; and those who do not leave the front line on account of minor wounds or are always in the van to advance and in the rear to evacuate.\\" For noncombat situations, the achievements would be those who \\"play a role in helping others to overcome difficulties such as caring about the wounded and the new recruits, [sic] are active in thinking to improve combat tactics and techniques...and have excellent outcomes in training or mutual learning activities, [sic] strictly observe disciplines, always respect local people and authorities, take good care of weapons and equipments, and good at criticism and self-criticism.\\" A candidate for the medal would normally be nominated by the deputy political officer of a company, while all squads within the company were required to meet once a month to list each soldier's accomplishments for the selection process. Once nominated, the political department of the candidate's regiment or division would be responsible for approving the nomination..  Reward and regulation  Once the nomination is approved, the recipient would be treated with a grand prize-giving ceremony that is intended to educate the unit that approved the nomination.. Besides the medal, the recipient also receives a ribbon bar and a certificate from the PLA General Political Department. According to the 1988 regulation, the medal must be worn on the upper left side of the recipient's uniform. The regulation also decreed that the medal itself can only be worn during special meetings and celebrations, while the ribbon bars are allowed in daily functions.

In 1896, the nave, porch and bell tower were moved from their original location and a new church was built. The chancel and the east gable of the old nave remain in the old churchyard as All Saints Chancel. Moving the church, 1896 By the early 1890s, the church had fallen into significant disrepair and the path leading to it was so wet that during winter it was practically inaccessible. The architect C.E. Ponting urged that the church should be restored and the approach improved. However, the Archdeacon of Bristol, Hemming Robeson, reported that it was \\"quite impossible to repair the church on its present site and at the same time secure its practical utility. I myself suggested...to rebuild the nave as far as possible, stone for stone, in a more convenient position.\\" This bold course was adopted. Mr. Charles T. Stevens offered to give a site and authorisation was obtained to take down and re-erect the nave, porch and tower at a cost not to exceed 1300 pounds. This was accomplished by carefully marking each stone and each piece of timber to correspond with drawings which had been made to ensure their correct positions and transporting them by hand to be rebuilt at the current site. The porch The porch was built in the late fourteenth century and the original roof, the door with its handmade nails and a niche with a pedestal for a figure can all still be seen. Also, probably a stoup for holy water. The nave The walls of the nave are thirteenth century but the massive wooden beams of the roof were unique to a Parish Church with a gothic character. The principle trusses of the roof are of collar form with the moulded braces pierced with openings of quatrefoil shape. Everywhere on the beams and bosses in the main part of the nave are carved heads and figures of Jacobean detail. At the East end of the nave, the roof has an oak boarded and panelled ceiling which probably dates back to the fifteenth century and was re-fixed in 1638 when the whole roof was re-built. The bosses are extremely rich and delicate in detail. Standing beneath this ceiling and looking west down the Nave, the text that can be seen on the lower part of the bell tower reads: > Colossians Chap III, Vers 16; > Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and > admonishing one another in psalms and hymns, singing with grace in your > hearts to the Lord. The inscriptions Moving the church to a more accessible site is commemorated by inscriptions carved on the south wood moulding: > Rebuilt here 1896 M.J. Milling Vicar. E. Manners R. Bolton Ch. Wardens. > C.E. Ponting Architect. W. Light and J. Smith Builders. On one of the south purlins: > I.T. I.L. C.W. 1783 On the collar of the east truss is carved the commemoration: > John Waldron and John Painter Chappel Wardens 1717 and 18. John Flux > Painter. The present roof was built in 1638 and this is recorded by a carving in the North side wood moulding: > W.T. T.W. H.N. Carpenters (with a fleur de lys between each initial) > continuing: Blanchadin Wake: John Waldron Church Wardens 1638. Other features There is an eighteenth-century pulpit and sounding board. The windows are fourteenth and fifteenth century and in one window in the north side of the nave a fragment of the original glass can be seen. Some of the pews near the pulpit are thought to be seventeenth century. Near the door is the font, with its history recorded on a brass plate at the base of the stem. The Rev. M.J. Milling discovered the font being used as a cheese press at an inn in Ashton Keynes and was told that it had previously been used as a cattle trough. Presumably it had been removed from the church and deliberately desecrated at the time of the Parliamentary Commonwealth when infant baptism was forbidden. In 1897, the stem was discovered forming the base of the north- east post of the tower and the whole font was restored to its proper use. The font ewer was given in memory of D.A. Bird, G. Price, V. Ody, and R. Godwin, who gave their lives in World War II 1939-1945. The chalice is dated 1596, in the reign of Elizabeth I, and the George I silver paten by Thomas Teasle was made in 1723. There was also a pewter flagon and plate for bringing the wine and bread to the altar. The flagon is inscribed \\"Richard Selby and John Tucker / Chapel Wardens 1776\\". The bells There are three bells. The largest is inscribed \\"Henry Neale Made Mee: 1627 GH:ESQVYER:EH:\\". The middle bell is inscribed \\"Ave Maria: Gracia Plena\\" and although no date is inscribed it is thought to have been made in Bristol about 1450. The third bell is inscribed \\"John Parker & John Waldron Ch. Wardens A R 1729\\". The chancel All Saints Chancel, Waterhay, now under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. All Saints Chancel (the original church) is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It was declared redundant on 1 February 1977, and was vested in the Trust on 24 October 1978. The chancel is entered through a finely moulded thirteenth century doorway which has a hood-mould resting on a human head and a beast's head. Inside, on the South wall there is a late thirteenth century window having three stepped lancet lights under one arch. On the wall of the chancel are 17th-century texts painted on the walls and framed in designs of clouds and scrolls. The inside sill is carried down a sedilia and in the east jamb there is a piscina for washing communion vessels. In 1983 the texts were re-lettered in their original style and we can see the similarity to the decoration of the Colossians text in the Church.

He attended St. John's from 1966 to 1970 where he excelled in academics and sports. Coleman was an All-City and All-State running back for St. John's and was recruited by multiple colleges to play football. He later recalled: \\"When it came time to select a university, I had about 20 coaches visiting the house, talking up their programs. I chose the University of Michigan. I received a full scholarship.\\" University of Michigan Coleman enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1970 on a football scholarship. He played college football for the Michigan Wolverines under head coach Bo Schembechler from 1971 to 1973. Coleman began the 1971 season as a backup fullback, but Schembechler moved him to defensive end in late September 1971. Coleman played at defensive end from 1972 to 1973 and helped the Wolverines tie for first place in the Big Ten Conference both years.(Enter \\"Coleman\\" for last name and \\"Donald\\" for first name on the search page, and press enter) Although still listed as a defensive end, Schembechler described Coleman's role as follows in 1973: \\"In our defense we use a flop- end. So Coleman is actually a pro linebacker. He has to cover the pass as part of his responsibility today more so than normal.\\" Coleman had 51 tackles and 52 assists for the Wolverines.(To access Coleman's record, enter \\"Don\\" as his first and \\"Coleman\\" as his last name in the main search page.

Professional football Coleman was drafted by the New Orleans Saints in the 16th round (398th overall pick) of the 1974 NFL Draft. He played two seasons for the Saints in 1974 and 1975, appearing in 27 NFL games. Coleman was cut by the Saints in August 1976. He signed as a free agent with the New York Jets shortly after being released by the Saints, but he missed the entire 1976 NFL season with a left knee injury. In August 1977, Coleman underwent surgery on his right knee, and he was placed on injured reserve status. The Jets released Coleman in June 1978. Advertising career While recovering from football injuries, Coleman obtained an M.B.A. degree in marketing from Hofstra University in New York in 1976. In 1978, he was hired as an assistant account executive at the Campbell-Ewald advertising agency in Detroit. He later recalled: \\"I was the only black person in account management in the office. It was boring work, but I was speedy and accurate, persevered and became a full account executive.\\" In 1983, he became senior vice president and management supervisor on the Chevrolet account. Coleman next began a career in advertising directed to minority communities. He was hired in 1983 as a senior vice president and account director for Burrell Advertising, a Chicago firm specializing in advertising to minorities. In 1988, he formed Don Coleman Associates, which became Don Coleman Advertising in 1991. He sold a minority interest in the company and bought two additional agencies, one focused on the Asian-American market (Innovasia Communications) and one focused on the Hispanic market (Montemayor y Asociados). He combined the companies into GlobalHue, specializing in a culture based approach to marketing. He is the chairman and chief executive of GlobalHue. In 2009, GlobalHue's capitalized billings were $833.7 million. The company has approximately 300 employees in Southfield, Michigan and New York City. Its clients include Subway, the United States Navy, U.S. Census 2010, Verizon Wireless, Merck & Co., Inc., Walmart and Chrysler Group. In 2009, GlobalHue was named \\"Multicultural Advertising Agency of the Decade\\" by Advertising Week magazine. In 2010, Black Enterprise magazine named GlobalHue the BE 100 Advertising Agency of the Year, an honor that GlobalHue also received in 1998 and 2003. Coleman's daughter, Kelli Coleman, has also worked for GlobalHue since 2002 and is the vice president for business development. In 2009, Coleman launched The Coleman Entrepreneurial Scholarship (CES), which strives to promote entrepreneurship as a career choice among college students of ethnic backgrounds, particularly African-American and Hispanic.http://www.blackenterprise.com/b-e-100s-rename- test/be100s-news/2009/02/03/advertising-mogul-creates-scholarship-to-promote- entrepreneurialism/ CES awards $50,000 in scholarships annually.http://www.targetmarketnews.com/storyid02040903.htm Coleman is also a member of the External Advisory Board at the A.C.

It is the sixth episode of the show's seventh season and was broadcast on October 31, 2010.http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20101007abc09 Plot Juanita is at Grace's house. She notices Gaby's necklace and asks Grace where she got it. Grace claims that it was a gift from her aunt, but Juanita is unconvinced and secretly takes it. When Gaby picks her up, Juanita tells her that Grace stole the necklace but she stole it back. Gaby admits that she gave Grace the jewellery as a present because she feels sorry for her as she is poor. Later, Grace arrives at the Solis's house to celebrate Halloween. Gaby tells Grace that she has never made a costume before but Grace replies that she loves it. \\"I've never had such a pretty costume before,\\" she says. \\"You're the best mom ever.\\" Gaby smiles, and Juanita arrives in her puppy costume. \\"You're adorable,\\" Gaby tells her, but suddenly Grace opens the door in her princess costume. Juanita tries to get Gaby's attention, but Gaby is preoccupied with Grace and styling her hair. Juanita looks on jealously. Later, Gaby takes Grace, Juanita and Celia trick-or-treating and greets Tom's mother, Allison. Allison accidentally suggests that Grace is Gaby's daughter, and Gaby is flustered as she hurriedly explains that Juanita is her child. Juanita is unimpressed and Gaby takes piles of candy for her, explaining that it is cheaper than therapy. Back at the house, Grace is thrilled with all the candy she got and hands Gaby a peppermint because she said she liked them. Gaby thanks her for being so thoughtful and leaves to give Celia a bath. Grace tugs at her tiara but cannot get it out of her hair. Juanita picks up some scissors and offers to help. Gaby is in the bathroom with Celia when she hears a scream. She goes to find out what happened and discovers half of Grace's hair shorn off while Juanita holds a tiara and some hair. \\"She was having a problem,\\" Juanita says. \\"I fixed it.\\" When Grace has gone, Gaby shouts at Juanita that her mother was furious but Grace pretended that it was all her idea. She adds that if she had not, Grace would not be able to play there anymore. \\"Who cares?\\" Juanita asks, adding that she has only known Grace for a month. Gaby tells her that she loves spending time with Grace but Juanita replies: \\"You do.\\" She adds: \\"You like her better than me.\\" Gaby insists that that is not true, but Juanita points out that Gaby gave Grace a necklace but will not let her touch the jewellery. \\"What's so special about Grace?\\" she yells. Gaby is at a loss for words, and Juanita leaves. Carlos, who has been watching, approaches Gaby and tells her that Juanita knows something is up. He adds that they should stay away from Grace. Gaby refuses, explaining that she will just be more careful. \\"We have to protect our daughter,\\" Carlos tells her, but Gaby replies: \\"They're both our daughters.\\" Susan tells Mike about her work for the Va Va Broom website. She tells him to yell if he wants to, but Mike replies that he should have taken the job on the oil rig in Alaska. He adds that if he had done a better job taking care of them she would not have had to resort to the website. Susan insists it is her fault, adding that she thought no one would ever know. She admits that Paul Young found out and is blackmailing her by forcing her to sell him their house. Mike is furious and picks up a hammer determined to confront Paul, but Susan begs him not to do anything because Paul wants to provoke a reaction from Mike. She climbs onto his back and claims that Paul did them a favor, saying: \\"I'm not lying now... look, we're closer than ever.\\" Mike does not listen, but Susan admits that she has an idea to get Paul to back off. Susan arrives at Paul's house with a basket of muffins and explains that she wants to move past their row. She claims that he has been a really good tenant and says that she is lucky, but suddenly notices a thumbtack on the wall. She produces Paul's lease agreement and claims that he is in violation by using the tack, adding that she wants him to vacate the premises within 60 days. Paul points out that she is in no position to make demands, but Susan reveals that she told Mike everything. She adds that Mike was furious that Paul was trying to blackmail her and shows him the hammer. \\"I had to pry it out of his hand so you would not need a paramedic to pry it out of your skull,\\" she warns. She puts a muffin on the counter to demonstrate and smashes it with the hammer. \\"This is you if you tell anyone and Mike finds out,\\" she threatens. She leaves, adding: \\"Oh, and enjoy those raisin muffins. I hope they're all raisins - my apartment has rats.\\" Paul takes Beth on a date to Oakridge School, which is hosting a Halloween event. Paul asks Beth to go and get some pumpkin bread and approaches a parent. The woman asks Paul if he is sending his children there and he admits that he does not because he has traditional family values. He explains that he heard something \\"troubling\\" about one of the teachers. When the woman asks what he knows, he asks: \\"Are you familiar with Mrs. Delfino?\\" Later, Susan is teaching her class when an assistant enters the room and tells her that the principal wants to see her. Later, she arrives home and admits to Mike that she got fired because someone found out about the website. She adds that it was not Paul who told the principal, but one of the parents. However, Mike still thinks that Paul had something to do with it. Mike asks what they are going to do, and decides to take the job in Alaska. Susan begs him not to for their son, M.J.'s, sake, but Mike replies: \\"How much thought did you give M.J. when you were dancing around in your underwear?\\" He adds that M.J. will probably find out about this now and announces that Susan can no longer make decisions about their family. He tells her to take M.J. trick-or-treating while he calls about the Alaska job. Beth and Paul arrive home from a date and Beth explains that she liked hearing from the other people at the school about Paul's childhood. \\"When you talk about the past, it changes how you look,\\" she says. \\"You're not so intimidating.\\" Paul leans in to kiss her, but Beth asks what he is doing. Paul tells her that he is not an \\"animal satisfying urges\\" and explains that he wants to connect with her. \\"I need a partner by my side,\\" he says. \\"Someone I can trust. I think you can be that person. The question is, do you?\\" He kisses her but Beth slaps him. Angry, Paul tells Beth that he wants her to move out by the end of the week. Later, Beth is on the phone to her mother and explains that Paul wants her to leave. \\"I am trying to make it work,\\" she says. \\"I swear I do everything he asks me.\\" Beth suggests that she should come home, adding: \\"Oh yes, I know I made a commitment but I am so unhappy... Of course I want you to be proud of me. OK, I will. I'll try.\\" Lee finds Susan, who is trick or treating with M.J.. He explains that Paul wanted to ask again if she has any interest in selling her house, explaining: \\"He said your circumstances recently changed.\\" Susan realizes that Paul was the one who got her fired and asks Lee to take M.J. trick or treating. She takes M.J.'s club from his Halloween caveman costume and knocks on Paul's door. When he opens it, she storms in and explained that she tried to give him the benefit of the doubt when he moved here. \\"But guess what,\\" she adds. \\"The benefit of the doubt is over.\\" She uses the club to smash up the kitchen and adds: \\"You know what, I'm glad I didn't let Mike do this because I'm really enjoying it. Aren't you?\\" She stands over Paul, who is on the floor, but Beth arrives on the stairs with a gun and tells Susan to get away from him. Susan tells Beth that she does not know what he has done or the person that Paul really is. But Beth replies: \\"I don't care. He's my husband. Now get out of our house!\\" When Susan has left, Beth asks Paul if he is all right and kisses him. Mike finishes packing for Alaska and Susan admits that she does not want him to go, for M.J. will become even more depressed than he already is without his father. Mike agrees but explains that he can earn enough money to get Paul out of their house and get their lives back. He adds that if he stays, he is afraid he will kill Paul. M.J. and Susan say goodbye to Mike. \\"The time comes when we all must find out what we're afraid of,\\" Mary Alice says. \\"The world is a scary place. It's even more terrifying if we have to face it alone.\\" Meanwhile, Lynette arrives back home and hands her mother-in-law, Allison, her handcream. Allison thanks her, but Lynette asks her where the baby is and Allison explains that she is still asleep. Lynette is annoyed because Allison promised to wake the baby at 3:00 PM and complains that Paige will be up all night. \\"You stop yelling at me,\\" Allison snaps. Lynette insists that she is not, but Allison shouts: \\"You're yelling at me, saying it's my fault, and it isn't! You're a liar!\\" That night, Lynette is trying to get Paige off to sleep when she notices Allison's handcream on the table. She takes it into the bathroom to put it away and notices that Allison already has ten jars of the product. She wakes up Tom and admits that she is worried about Allison. Tom suggests that she just forgets things because she is older but Lynette adds that she has moodswings as well. Tom defends Allison, but Lynette says: \\"I get it... she's your mom, you love her. You can look for excuses for every one of these things, but I think there's more going on than just being a little forgetful.\\" She settles down to sleep while Tom looks concerned. The next morning, Tom asks Allison if she is alright and explains that she has seemed \\"scattered\\" lately. Allison replies that he has always been a worrywart and reminds him of the time he went to camp but wanted to come home because he was worried his family would be hurt by a hurricane. She goes up to get dressed and Tom tells Lynette that his mother is remembering things that he forgot about. Lynette replies that she has been doing research about senile dementia in which a person's long-term memory remains more or less intact, their short- term memory escapes them. Lynette also found out about \\"sundowning\\", where senile people deteriorate later in the day and when their short-term memory goes, eventually their long-term memory will go as well. Tom continues to insist that his mother is not senile, adding that Lynette has been trying to get her out of the house since she arrived. Lynette denies that this is a tactic, adding that she is starting to get worried and is not comfortable leaving her with the baby. \\"There's nothing wrong with my mother, OK?\\" Tom yells. \\"So just drop it.\\" When the children on Wisteria Lane start trick-or- treating, Allison warns that they are about to run out of candy. Tom explains that he has lots left in the cupboard. However, later, Allison repeats again that they are running out of candy and decides to go to the store. Penny insists that there is more somewhere but Allison promises her that she will take care of it and leaves as Penny looks on, worried. Later, Tom is watching horror movies with his sons (the thumb-cutting scene from Two Thousand Maniacs!) when the doorbell rings. Tom shouts to Allison to answer it, but Penny explains that she went out to get more candy. Tom goes to find her, explaining to the children that it is just a little late for Allison to be out. He walks through the crowd of trick-or-treaters looking for her, but does not notice her sitting on the curb looking scared and confused. Meanwhile, Lynette is talking to Lee at Renee's party when she receives a call from Carlos and promises that she will be right there. At the Solis house, she finds Allison sitting on the porch. \\"Oh thank God,\\" Allison says. \\"I was walking, I must have got turned around. I made it up to Claire Graham's place but the lights were out.\\" Lynette gently tells her that there is no Claire Graham on the street and suggests that they go home. Tom arrives and watches as Allison snaps, yelling: \\"Let go of me! You're doing this to me, you're making me feel crazy. I said let go!\\" Allison slaps Lynette across the face, and immediately apologizes. She spots Tom, who says: \\"It's OK, mom. I'm here.\\" The next morning, Tom announces that the car is loaded and ready to go and Allison replies sadly: \\"To the nursing home.\\" Tom insists that she is not going to a nursing home, explaining that it is \\"assisted living\\", but Allison asks him: \\"When do I get to leave? When do I get to go home?\\" She adds that she knows many elderly people who have gone to these places and not returned. Tom explains that Allison cannot live alone anymore and adds that if something bad happened he would never forgive himself. \\"The only bad thing happening here is what you're doing to me,\\" Allison tells him. Tom admits that he does not know what else to do. \\"When you called me from that camp you were scared,\\" Allison says. \\"You kept saying, 'I want to come home, mom'. And I said, 'Tommy, if you mean that, I'll come get you'. That's what you do.\\" She gets up and Lynette comforts a tearful Tom. Meanwhile, Keith takes Bree back to his apartment and when he opens the door she is shocked at how clean and tidy it is. \\"I had this whole frozen smile ready,\\" she admits. When Keith explains that he just switched his pot pourri, Bree tells him: \\"Take me right now on the table.\\" They begin kissing but are interrupted when Keith's female roommate Mimi walks through the apartment. Bree is surprised that Keith has a roommate and says: \\"It looks like that frozen smile came in handy after all.\\" The next morning, Bree wakes up in Keith's apartment and meets Mimi in the kitchen. She apologises and explains that Keith never told her that he had a female roommate. She adds: \\"He said you never slept together except those two times.\\" Mimi squeals that they have never had sex and Bree admits that Keith told her that but she needed to see her reaction to know it was true. \\"Nicely done,\\" Mimi replies. \\"You don't need to worry about other women. The guy never stops talking about you.\\" Bree is pleased, and Mimi asks her to give Keith his mail. Bree agrees but as she flicks through the envelopes she notices one from the department of corrections. Later, Bree finds Renee and asks her if she ever thought Keith might be a \\"little crazy\\". She admits that she found out he is on probation for assault. Renee tells her that Keith was just standing up for his girlfriend at the time when a man started hitting on her. She explains that she found out from the barman. \\"It's nice to know chivalry isn't dead,\\" Bree smiles. Renee tells her that if she wants to find out if Keith is violent, she should start a fight with him and see if he hits her. Later, Bree and Keith arrive at Renee's party. Bree, who is dressed as a cheerleader, is approached by a man dressed as a football player and they joke about their costumes. The football player asks if he gets a kiss for scoring the winning touchdown, but Bree explains that someone else is taking her to the prom. When he persists, Bree tells him that their skit is over and eventually calls over Keith. She explains that the man will not leave her alone and Keith makes him leave. Bree thanks him for being so gallant, but as she turns away and continues talking he walks over to the man again and begins shouting at him. Bree runs after him and begs Keith to stop. Eventually, Keith walks outside and Bree follows, asking what happened. \\"He pushed my buttons and I went off,\\" Keith shouts. \\"Is it not obvious?\\" Bree asks him why he is yelling at her and Keith explains that he has been arrested for this before and knows he has a problem. He says that he knows she wants to break up with him but Bree denies it. \\"Nine years ago my son found me face down, drunk,\\" she tells him. \\"He had to turn the sprinklers on to wake me up. Did you not know you're dating the biggest lush in Fairview?\\" She adds that they all have baggage and she can deal with his anger. \\"Do you think you can deal with a control freak with a drinking problem?\\" she asks. Keith kisses her. Renee arrives at Lynette's house to invite them to a party. Gaby explains that Grace is sleeping over but suggests that they could come over and show the adults Grace and Juanita's costume. She adds that Juanita is going as a puppy and will be \\"so cute\\". However, Renee insists that no children are allowed to come. Bree offers to attend if she can bring Keith, and Renee replies: \\"I guess one child will be OK.\\" Reception On its original broadcast on ABC, the episode scored 11.096 million of viewers and achieved a 3.5 rating in the adults 18-49 demographic.http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/11/02/sunday-finals-amazing- race-undercover-boss-adjusted-up-60-minutes-adjusted-down/70486/ With the DVR Rating, this episode is up 2.2 in million of viewers (rising to a total of 13.3 million of viewers) and it is up 1.1 in the adults 18-49 demographic (rising to a total of a 4.6 rating).http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/11/15/live7-dvr-ratings-greys- anatomy-the-event-parenthood-modern-family-top-weeks-rankings/72059/ Notes * It was the second episode about Halloween.

While returning from her first bombing raid on the United Kingdom in early 1916, she came down in the North Sea. Her crew survived the crash, but drowned after the crew of a British fishing vessel refused to rescue them; at the time this was a widely reported and notorious incident.  Background  LZ 54 was one of 22 P-class military Zeppelins built by Luftschiffbau Zeppelin for the Imperial German Army and Navy as improved versions of the pre-war, M-class airship, with larger gas volume and more power, having four instead of three engines. These were initially Maybach C-X engines; later replaced with the Maybach HSLu. LZ 54 had two gondolas, a control cabin forward with a single engine and rear gondola mounting the other three engines. The P-class Zeppelins were around faster than the earlier craft, and had a higher service ceiling, double the payload and over double the range. A bomb load of could be carried and a number of MG 08 machine guns were mounted for aircraft defence. The number of guns varied ‚Äì army Zeppelins carried more as they operated over land and enemy aircraft were a greater threat, navy Zeppelins carried fewer to save weight. The guns were mounted in the two gondolas under the airship, in a tail gun position, and on a dorsal gun platform on the top of the envelope. This upper platform could accommodate three guns and their gunners. The airship's normal complement was 18, but it could be flown with a smaller crew.Chant, page 109 LZ 54 first flew on 27 November 1915, completing 14 flights during her nine weeks of service. Several of these flights were patrols over the North Sea, searching for Allied merchant and naval ships. Naval scouting was the main role of the navy's Zeppelin fleet, and a total of 220 such flights were carried out during the war.Stephenson, p. 13. The lack of aggressive activity by the German Navy meant the tactical need for such scouting was reduced. During the winter of 1915, LZ 54 became well-known to neutral merchant ships in the North Sea due to her frequent patrols. On one occasion, she touched down close to a Swedish ship to inspect her. The ship was allowed to proceed when her neutral status was established. On another occasion, she and two other Zeppelins forestalled a British air raid by discovering, to the north of Terschelling, an approaching flotilla of three Royal Navy seaplane tenders, an apparent British attempt to repeat their successful Cuxhaven Raid. The British were surprised while lowering their seaplanes into the sea.Lehmann, ch. 1.  Final raid  Kapit√§nleutnant Odo L√∂we, circa 1915 Commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant Odo L√∂we, L 19 left her Danish base at Tondern at noon on 31 January 1916, one of nine navy Zeppelins to raid England that night. This was part of a new, more aggressive strategy that had been brought to the German Navy with the recent appointment of Reinhard Scheer as its commander-in-chief.Robinson, p. 120. The head of German naval airships, Fregattenkapit√§n Peter Strasser, was on board L 11, leading the attack personally.Robinson, p. 121. He had orders to bomb targets of opportunity in central and southern England, reaching Liverpool if possible. The Zeppelins encountered thick fog in the North Sea, followed by rain clouds and snow off the English coast, and the attacking force became dispersed; the nine airships crossed the English coast between 17:50 and 19:20. L 19 was the very last, crossing the coast near Sheringham. At 22:45, she reached Burton on Trent, becoming the third raider to attack the town that night.Robinson, page 126 She then proceeded south, dropping the remainder of her bomb load on several towns on the outskirts of Birmingham. At 00:20, a pub in Tipton was destroyed; buildings were also damaged in nearby Walsall and Birchills. She caused no casualties aside from some farm animals, although bombs dropped three hours earlier by her sister-ship, the , killed 35 people in the area, including the wife of the mayor of Walsall; a total of 61 people were reported killed and 101 injured by the raid. Due to the extreme difficulties of navigating with primitive equipment at night over a darkened countryside, the captain of L 21 believed he had bombed Liverpool, in fact around away. L 19 made a slow, erratic return journey, doubling back several times; this was almost certainly due to engine trouble. The Zeppelin force had been newly fitted with Maybach HSLu engines. While lighter and more powerful than those they replaced, the new engines were proving unreliable ‚Äì five of the nine airships had suffered engine failures during the raid. L 19 sent several signals, asking for a position fix by radio-triangulation and reporting the results of her bombing. The last signal was heard from her at 16:00 on the day after the raid when she was north of the Dutch island of Ameland. She reported three out of four engines had failed and her Telefunken radio equipment was malfunctioning. Around an hour later, the Zeppelin drifted low over the island, and Dutch units on the ground opened fire on her. The Netherlands was a neutral country and Dutch forces had standing orders to fire on overflying, foreign aircraft. A south wind blew the L 19 offshore and, some time during the night of 1‚Äì2 February, the Zeppelin came down in the North Sea. L√∂we dropped a bottle into the sea, with a report on his situation and with letters to his family; this was found a few weeks later by a yacht near Gothenburg, Sweden. The German Navy put ships to sea that night to search for the L 19, but they only discovered one of her fuel-tanks, still containing fuel.Robinson, page 127 This was likely dropped as a desperate measure to save weight and remain aloft. = King Stephen incident = Flight, 10 February 1916 The next morning, the floating wreck of the airship was discovered by a British steam fishing trawler, King Stephen, of 162 tons, commanded by William Martin. The vessel had sighted distress signals during the night and had spent several hours steaming towards them. Clinging to the wreck were the airship's 16 crew. The normal complement of a P-class Zeppelin was 18 or 19, but Zeppelins flying on air-raids often flew short-handed, with two or three of the least needed crew members left behind in order to save weight.Robinson, page 358 The fishing vessel approached and Kapit√§nleutnant L√∂we, who spoke English well, asked for rescue. Martin refused. In a later newspaper interview, he stated that the nine crew of King Stephen were unarmed and badly outnumbered and would have had little chance of resisting the German airmen if, after being rescued, they had hijacked his vessel to sail it to Germany. This fits the known facts, but an alternative explanation for his action was suggested by a 2005 BBC documentary on the incident. This was that King Stephen was in a zone in which fishing was prohibited by the British authorities and that Martin feared that if he returned to a British port with a large number of German prisoners, attention might have been drawn to this and he would have been banned from fishing. Ignoring the Germans' pleas for help, disbelieving their promises of good conduct, and refusing their offers of money, Martin sailed away. He later said he intended to search for a Royal Navy ship to report his discovery to. However, he met none. The encounter with L 19 was reported to the British authorities on his return to King Stephens home port of Grimsby. No official action on the supposed illegal fishing is recorded to have been taken, however, the vessel did not fish again and later became a Q-boat. The weather was worsening as King Stephen departed and the Zeppelin remained afloat for only a few hours. During this time, L 19s crew threw a bottle with messages into the sea. Discovered six months later by Swedish fishermen at Marstrand, the bottle contained personal last messages from the airmen to their families and a final report from L√∂we. Royal Navy ships made a search of the area, but they found no trace of the Zeppelin or her crew. The body of one of the Germans washed ashore four months later at L√∏kken in Denmark. In 1964, a journalist researching the incident checked Admiralty archives and interviewed two surviving members of King Stephens crew. This revealed that Martin had indeed been fishing in a forbidden zone and had initially given the naval authorities a false position for the Zeppelin in order to conceal this, making the Royal Navy search for the airship futile.Chamberlain, page 48 \\"Pirate's punishment: returning from a raid on England, Zeppelin L 19 sinks in the North Sea\\" Loss of Zeppelin L 19, medal by Karl Goetz The incident received worldwide publicity and divided British public opinion. Captain Martin was condemned by many for leaving the German airmen to die. Others, including Arthur Winnington-Ingram, the Bishop of London, praised Martin for placing the safety of his crew first and not trusting the promises of the Germans. Some elements of the Allied press viewed the Germans' deaths as just \\"retribution\\" for their bombing of civilian targets. German airship crews, sometimes referred to as \\"baby killers\\" or \\"pirates\\" because of their bombing of civilians, were the subject of intense Allied propaganda and public hatred. Martin was vilified by the German press, as was the Bishop of London for supporting him. The encounter between the L 19 and King Stephen also featured in German propaganda. The scene was recreated for a German propaganda film and illustrated by an anti-British medal, designed by Karl Goetz who also designed the well-known Lusitania medal. The incident was still remembered 25 years later, when it was used in Nazi-era, anti-British propaganda. King Stephen never again sailed as a fishing vessel. After her return, she was taken over by the Royal Navy for use as a Q-ship, under the command of Lieutenant Tom Phillips. She was sunk 12 weeks later on 25 April 1916.British Vessels Lost at Sea, pg 14 An official German communiqu√©, reported by the New York Times, stated she had been sunk by one of the German vessels taking part in the bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft. King Stephen, now fitted with a 3 pounder Hotchkiss gun, had fired on and pursued a surfaced U-boat, but then inadvertently steamed directly into the path of the returning German fleet. She was sunk by the torpedo boat and her crew taken prisoner. King Stephens name was notorious to the Germans, and Lt. Phillips was charged with war crimes upon reaching Germany. However, the charges were dropped and he and his crew were treated as normal prisoners-of- war after a photograph of William Martin was published in a British newspaper and the Germans realized they held another man. William Martin himself died of heart failure in Grimsby on 24 February 1917, slightly over a year after encountering the L 19. He had received a large numbers of letters, including both letters of support and, reportedly, hate mail and death threats. In July 1939, an unexploded munition‚Äîdescribed by a press report as an aerial torpedo‚Äîwas discovered near Kidderminster during renovation work on a bridge. At the time, it was believed to have been dropped by the L 19.  Relics  One of the L 19 crew's bottles, together with its messages, are surviving relics of the incident; they were displayed as part of an exhibition at the National Maritime Museum in London in 2001. The Aeronauticum, the German naval aviation museum in Nordholz, displays one of the King Stephens lifebelts, as well as her Red Ensign flag, taken from the vessel before she was sunk. Both the National Maritime Museum and the National Air and Space Museum in the United States own rare examples of Karl Goetz's medal.

It lies in the northern part of the district of Celle on the L√ºneburg Heath, 1 km east of Bergen, at a height of 77 to 81 m above sea level (NN). The name is derived from Berger Wohld (= \\"Berger Wald\\" i.e. Bergen Wood).  History  Bronze Age tumulus near Wohlde = Tumuli = 600 metres northwest of Wohlde are 45 tumuli dating to the Nordic Old Bronze Age, most of which are located in a small wood. It is the largest burial site of its kind in the district of Celle. This burial site belonged to the so-called L√ºneburg Culture (1500-1200 BC). Originally there were many more graves east of here, but over time they have disappeared thanks to agriculture. Only those predominantly located in the wooded hillocks have survived undisturbed to the present day. The dead were buried in hollowed-out oak trunks. Stones with burn marks were found at their heads. It is believed that these are stones from their domestic hearth. The oak coffins were covered with earth, which was supported by rings of stone walls to prevent the earth from collapsing. The numerous grave objects of jewelry and weapons suggest that the population at the time must have been wealthy. = Forest chapel = Replica of a pranger Until about 1623 there was a forest chapel in Wohlde. It is believed to have stood near the sport where there is the replica of a pranger today. Chapel door in the R√∂mstedthaus Museum in Bergen The church (a \\"Mary chapel\\"), \\"the Chapel of Our Dear Lady, the Chapel of the Holy and Blessed Virgin Mary, the Mother of God in Berger Wohld\\" was probably built around 1383. The Bergen pastor and chronicler, Ludwig Spitta, wrote in 1875: And it is quite likely that it was the first chapel in our Bergen parish. Under Duke Henry of Brunswick-L√ºneburg the chapel was given to St. Michael's Monastery in L√ºneburg. On 31 January 1510 Pope Julius II issued the last letter of indulgence for the St. Michael's Monastery at L√ºneburg, and this was for the pilgrims in Wohlde. The chapel became a popular place of pilgrimage. Several tradesmen were located nearby. There was also a small market that has survived to this day and is known nationally as the Wohlde Market. With the beginning of the Reformation, the chapel was closed. In the Thirty Years' War, it was completely destroyed. The chapel door, made of sturdy oak planks, has been preserved and is now the oldest exhibit in the R√∂mstedthaus museum in Bergen.  Economy  Factory site of KWS Lochow in Wohlde KWS LochowKWS Lochow GmbH (formerly Lochow-Petkus), a subsidiary of KWS Saat, has its headquarters in Wohlde. The firm is a specialist in cereal breeding within the KWS Group and runs a total of four European companies in Germany, Great Britain, Poland and France. In Wohlde it has about 100 workers and employs a total of about 360 people overall. The company was founded in 1926 by Ferdinand von LochowFerdinand von Lochow in Petkus (March of Brandenburg). It started as long ago as 1881 with rye breeding.  Places of interest  In a wooded area northwest of Wohlde the Bergen Conservancy has created a so-called \\"forest classroom\\". A pyramid- shaped structure, about five feet high and made of wood, can be used as a classroom. There is also a forest trail, a pond biotope, various information boards and reference material about nature and the coexistence of man and nature.

This behavior can often be attributed to certain feelings, such as dislike or anger. The negative evaluation of the person may involve criticizing their actions, efforts or characteristics.Joseph, N. T., Myers, H. F., Schettino, J. R., Olmos, N. T., Bingham-Mira, C., Lesser, I. M., & Poland, R. E. (2011). Support and undermining in interpersonal relationships are associated with treatment response to a trial of antidepressant medication. Psychiatry: Interpersonal And Biological Processes, 74(3), 240-254. Social undermining is seen in relationships between family members, friends, personal relationships and co- workers. Social undermining can affect a person's mental health, including an increase in depressive symptoms. This behavior is only considered social undermining if the person's perceived action is intended to hinder their target. When social undermining is seen in the work environment the behavior is used to hinder the co-worker's ability to establish and maintain a positive interpersonal relationship, success and a good reputation. Examples of how an employee can use social undermining in the work environment are behaviors that are used to delay the work of co-workers, to make them look bad or slow them down, competing with co-workers to gain status and recognition and giving co- workers incorrect or even misleading information about a particular job. Definition According to Duffy, Ganster, and Pagon, 2002, the definition of social undermining in a workplace is, behavior intended to hinder over time and not allowing a person to establish or maintain positive interpersonal relationships. In the workplace Social undermining has been very effective in the workplace. Various aspects of social undermining have affected the workplace and specific races. In workplaces, social undermining has connection with social interaction. Research has shown if a person has a supportive environment in their work setting, they are more likely to have a more satisfied life. Research has shown that social undermining exists in a separate and distinct continuum when looking at positive workplace behavior (e.g. social support). Social undermining can arise through interactions with co-workers and supervisors; these interactions have an effect on the workers that are being undermined and can affect their work performance. Vinokur found that those who alleged to have social undermining in the workplace reported to have poorer mental health and experienced less well-being. The study shows that undermining has a significant role in worker-supervisor and co-worker relationship and that it leads to various different outcomes such as feelings of irritability, anxiety, depersonalization, and depression. It shows that social undermining affects a person's work ethics and well being. Various different empirical studies have found that undermining has three specific factors that develop counterfactual thoughts. For example: \\"what would my life be like if I were not the target of undermining?\\" These studies' findings indicate that \\"this rift plays a role in determining the magnitude of the employee's reaction to the event by making the deprived state more salient\\".Folger, R., & Cropanzano, R. (1998). Organizational justice and human resource management. London: Sage.Folger, R., & Cropanzano, R. (2001). Fairness theory: justice as accountability. In J. Greenberg & R. Copanzano (Eds.), Advances in organizational justice (pp. 1‚Äì55). Palo Alto, CA: Stanford University Press.Folger, R., & Kass, E. (2000). Social comparison and fairness: a counterfactual simulations perspective. In J. Suls & L. Wheeler(Eds.), Handbook of social comparison: Theory and research (pp. 423‚Äì433). New York: Kluwer Academic. Behaviors of social undermining can affect a person and their perceptions. The study conducted by Gant et al. addressed African American workers' perceptions of co-workers and supervisors. The research by Duffy, Gangster, Shaw, Johnson, and Pagon addressed the fairness theory introduced by Folger and Cropanzano 1998. The fairness theory suggests that when individuals face negative situations (such as being undermined by coworkers or supervision) they make cognitive comparisons known as counterfactual thoughts; i.e., they compare what actually happened to what might have been.Kasimatis, M., & Wells, G. (1995). Individual differences in counter-factual thinking. In N. Roese & J. Olson (Eds.), What might have been: The social psychology of counterfactual thinking (pp. 81‚Äì102). New York: Lawrence Erlbaum The results show that social undermining is closely related to attitudes and behavior regarding one person being or feeling \\"singled out\\". =Envy= While social undermining can affect a person's behavior and attitude on their job, it can also bring about envy. Envy can have a positive or negative effect: positive effects include increased performance or attempts at self-improvement. However, envy can have some very harmful effects, including aggression or crime. It can lead to belittling, gossip, withholding information, and giving someone the silent treatment. =Abusive supervision= Abusive supervision can arise in different areas such as in the household, at school, and at a workplace. \\"Abusive supervision has been investigated as an antecedent to negative subordinate workplace outcome\\" ;Hoobler, J. M., Tepper, B. J., & Duffy, M. K. ( 2000). Moderating effects of coworkers' organizational citizenship behavior on relationships between abusive supervision and subordinates' attitudes and psychological distress. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Southern Management Association, Orlando, FL. \\"Workplace violence has combination of situational and personal factors\\" (e.g., Barling, 1996). The study that was conducted looked at the link between abusive supervision and different workplace events. Social undermining can arise from abusive supervision, such as when a supervisor uses negative actions and it leads to \\"flow downhill\\"; a supervisor is perceived as abusive. Research has shown that \\"abusive supervision is a subjective assessment made by subordinates regarding their supervisors\\" behavior towards them over a period of time. For example, abusive supervision includes a \\"boss demeaning, belittling, or invading privacy of the subordinate. Hostile attribution bias is an extra punitive mentality where individuals tend to project blame on others. Researchers wanted to see how hostile attribution bias can moderate the relationship between perceptions of psychological contract violation and subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision. Undermining does arise with abusive supervision, which affects families and aggression; they believe that there is a stronger positive relationship between experiences of psychological contract violation and subordinates' reports of abuse. It suggests that when someone has a negative work environment, it will affect their emotional training ground where this would result in negative home encounters. The findings from this study show that abused subordinates' family members reported a higher incidence of undermining in their home. When this occurs, complications arise at both home and work. Workplace abuse may be spawning negative interpersonal relations in the home, which may contribution to a downward spiral of relationships in both spheres. When a subordinate is being abused, it can lead to negative affect towards their family where the subordinate starts undermining their family members. The undermining can arise from displaced aggression which is \\"redirection of a [person's] harm doing behavior from a primary to a secondary target\\" (Tedeschi & Norman, 1985, p. 30). Family undermining arises from a negative work environment: when someone above you puts you down, one starts to think that one should be put down by one's family members. =Bottom-line mentality= Bottom line is defined as profits or losses of a business. Greenbaum and colleagues found that some employees tend to focus on a bottom-line outcome, which may be related to their tendency to engage in social undermining behavior. Employees with a bottom line mentality (BLM) tend to focus on only the bottom line, and to neglect other outcomes of their actions, including interpersonal consequences. Research has found that a bottom-line mentality can cause a problem, especially if the employer uses BLM as an objective for them to strive for. If someone is hurt by their actions it is not a priority for those with a BLM. Employees that have a BLM may learn these actions from their supervisors. BLMs can cause rivalries within the organization since the employee may feel as if the organization should have a winner or loser when it comes to completing work. Employees with this approach think of their work as a game where the winner takes all instead of working with other employees to make sure everyone is contributing to the work that needs to be completed. The competitiveness that is created between the coworkers is to attain bottom-line outcomes. When the employees are trying to attain bottom-line outcomes, with this winner-take-all mentality, they begin to want their co-workers to fail as that consequently means, to them, they, the undermining employee, must be succeeding. The supervisor's BLM causes employee social undermining. This happens because the employees may role-model after the adopted supervisor's BLM. Employee personality also plays a role in the relationship between BLM and undermining. Employees that have confidence in their work ability rely on their work ethic while employees who are low in confidence are more likely to engage in social undermining behavior to make themselves look better when it comes to the bottom line of success. Individual differences Research suggests that whether or not someone engages in social support or social undermining depends upon their own goals. Those with compassionate goals are more likely to be supportive of others, while those who have more selfish motives believe that people should take care of themselves. When people have goals to preserve their own self-image this can undermine their compassionate goals and make them less supportive. Health Research has shown that social undermining can have an effect on a person's health. It has been shown that social undermining can cause depressive symptoms. Depending on the relationship between a patient and their loved one, the loved one can support or undermine the patient and can even do both within the same interaction, which can increase the depressive symptoms. Creating more social support can improve treatment outcomes of a patient depending on the type of stress level the person is enduring. Research by Joseph et al. found that when participants are exposed to high levels of social undermining and even high levels of social support it can improve the participants course of antidepressive treatment. High levels of social support and social undermining could reduce and also cause remission of the participant's depressive symptoms. The study found that African American participants who had low levels of social undermining were able to fare better than the Caucasians participants in reducing their symptoms. When both groups of participants were given high levels of social undermining the African American participants had fewer achievements in symptom reduction, while the Caucasians participants had the reverse effect of symptom reduction. Research conducted by Horwitz et al. (1998) found that spouse undermining was almost twice as large as the effect for support. For example, a spouse that shows behaviors of withdrawal, avoidance and being overly critical can cause psychological distress in a relationship. This in turn causes stress that increases the depressive symptoms on individuals that have endure high levels of social undermining. This can happen, because the support that a person can get from their spouse compared to a close friend is more exclusive and generally involves more frequent and emotionally intense interactions (Cutrone 1996; Vinokur & Vinokur & Vinokur- Kaplan, 1990) and depending on their relationship that can influence the social support or even the social undermining that affect the relationship. Cranford found that spouse undermining and not spouse support can increase depressive symptoms within that relationship. Social undermining has been found to be a stronger indicator for psychological adaption than social support. When there is social undermining in a relationship it can have fatal effects on the spouse's ability to deal with other stressors. It can also lead to an increase of wishful thinking, poor psychological adjustment, maladaptive coping behaviors, and even decrease adaptive coping behaviors. This can give more attention to coping resources and it takes away from other stressors which causes the couple to have fewer chances resolving their problems. If the couple cannot resolve their problems it can cause marital conflict. Social undermining within the relationship can cause negative effects on the spouse physical health and can make the spouse vulnerable to different stressors. This can lead to depressive symptoms that can lessen the spouse self-esteem. =Nutrition and exercise= Research has shown that partners that offer social support can also offer social undermining. An example of this is when family members try to undermine parenting styles in order to raise healthy children. Another study found that participants who endure social undermining regarding their eating and exercise behavior, try to ignore the pressure, and the undermining affects their exercise decisions more than eating decisions. Market, Stanforth, and Garcia found that social undermining used by family members, friends and coworkers can affect daily activities. Social undermining can affect exercise routines when their exercise routines can conflict with seeing friends or even coworkers. Friends and coworkers can influence the person to skip their exercise, even when a spouse is concerned about their well being. The study also showed that social undermining can affect men and women differently. Men tend to feel as if they can overcome social undermining because they were still able to make a healthy eating decision. Women have stated that they tend to make bad eating decision when they are eating with other people such as their friends. Social undermining pressures can cause serious challenges when a person is trying to maintain healthy eating and trying to stay active. The study found that people that engage in undermining behavior tend to feel guilty about their own unhealthy behavior and may feel jealous of someone else maintaining their healthy behavior when they cannot achieve the same behavior. The study also suggests when a person is satisfied with their weight it can help the person resist against social undermining. By being satisfied with one's own weight can reduce the likelihood of social undermining in social situations when having dinner with friends. So when a person is not satisfied with their weight they receive more social undermining pressures from the people around them. =Mental health= Social undermining and social support can have opposite effects on a person that can be negative or positive depending on the person or even the relationship. Being in a close relationship can provide a person both social undermining and social support. Example of these relationships can be an abusive relationship that offers low support and high undermining. A typical healthy close relationship has high support and low undermining. In a relationship between an adolescent and a parent, their relationship can offer high levels of support and even undermining. Depending on the relationship, patterns can change over time based on the characteristics and the situation of the relationship. Whether a relationship is positive or negative can have devastating effects. Social support can give a person coping resources that can reduce threat in a stressful situation. In a relationship if a partner has lower status or even lower power social undermining becomes more of threat for the relationship. Research concludes that social undermining has a greater impact on a person's mental health than social support. Vinokur and van Ryn used unemployed participants and some of the participants were reemployed to look at the impact that social support and social undermining can have on a person's mental health during economic hardships. They suggest that although the support and undermining are inversely and strongly correlated they do not form the same factor but constitute empirically distinct constructs. The study looked at the effect of financial strain, social support, and undermining on poor mental health the results found that it was not statistically significant. Social support and social undermining did have significant but the opposite effect on poor mental health. Vinokur and Ryn(1993) found that social support and undermining were shown in longitudinal design even when prior levels of mental health and the contribution of another critical stressful factor. Social support and undermining had a dynamic pattern influence on mental health. The results showed that social support has weak positive effect while social undermining has more volatile effects. Even though the study found that a high level of social undermining has significant effects on mental health when the high levels are reduced there is an improvement in the person mental health over a period of time. In the study participants that received high levels of social undermining even after they return to their normal interactions the participant still returns to high level of undermining that affects the person mental health. These findings were found in relationships for men and women that were either unemployed or reemployed. Another example of how social undermining can affect a person's relationship is shown by a study conducted by McCaskill and Lakey which examined social support and social undermining when it came to adolescents and family relationships. Social support and social undermining can reflect different characteristics in the environment that can influence a person's mental health. The study examined how adolescents reported their family support and undermining which reflected shared social reality (that is, all members of the family agree that support or undermining is occurring) and idiosyncratic perception (some family members believe that support or undermining has occurred, but others do not). The results of the study found that girls tend to report higher family stress and negative affect than boys. McCaskill and Lakey (2002) found that adolescents with previous outpatient treatment experience reported both lower family support and higher family stress. Researchers found that in adolescent self- reports, social undermining was related to negative affect and perceived support was more related to positive affect. The study found that adolescents' idiosyncratic perceptions of family support did predict positive emotion, but shared perceptions of support did not. For social undermining, adolescents' idiosyncratic perceptions, the idiosyncratic perceptions of the other family members as well as shared social reality that was among family members did predict negative emotion. The study suggest that social support is not based on a shared reality, while social undermining is. Due to the differences in the scope of the effects of social undermining and social support, many researchers have concluded that they are separate constructs, rather than two ends of a continuum. Emotional and behavioral reactions Research has found that, depending on how the victim handles social undermining, it can have damaging effects when it comes to increased counterproductive behaviors, reciprocated social undermining, and decreased job satisfaction. These negative outcomes can cause the person to have depression, a decreased self- esteem and even psychosomatic symptoms. In a study of victims' perceptions of undermining they had experienced, Crossley found that when an offense was severe, the victim was more likely to believe that the offender committed the action with malicious intent or due to personal greed. Generally, victims' perceptions of the offenders' intentions relate to whether the victim responds to the undermining in a negative fashion with feelings of anger and a desire for revenge, or in a positive fashion with a desire to reconcile with the offender. Post Traumatic Embitterment Disorder can be a reaction to this feeling of victimisation.

Otto originated as a subtropical cyclone lingering north of Puerto Rico on October 6, and transitioned into a tropical storm the next day, the fifteenth of the 2010 hurricane season. Accelerating toward the northeast, Otto strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale on October 8, attaining peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). The storm began weakening due to incompatible surroundings and became extratropical west of the Azores on October 10\\\\. Otto was the first Atlantic tropical cyclone on record to transition from a subtropical storm since Tropical Storm Laura in 2008. Drifting near the northeastern Caribbean for several days, Otto and its precursor disturbance brought prolonged rainfall to the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, triggering widespread flooding and numerous mudslides. Damage from the storm--in particular to roads, property and infrastructure--exceeded $22.5 million (2010 USD), but there were no fatalities. After recurving toward the northeast, Otto proceeded across the open Atlantic without affecting any other landmasses. Meteorological history In late September, a large area of disturbed weather associated with two tropical waves formed just east of the Lesser Antilles. The disturbance drifted very slowly west-northwestward, inhibited by strong wind shear that eventually caused the westernmost wave to dissipate. Albeit weak, an elongated remnant trough, or area of low pressure, persisted for several days, stalling over the extreme eastern Caribbean Sea as a nearby upper-level cyclonic vortex retrograded to its north. By October 5, the trough had drifted northward into a more favorable atmospheric environment over the Virgin Islands, which allowed the lowest pressures to extend to the surface. The low became well defined, interacting with the adjacent upper vortex to produce a wide convective band--a concentrated region in which strong showers and thunderstorms can form--over the northeastern Caribbean. Over the next day, the system continued to acquire a prominent subtropical structure: it developed a markedly larger wind radius than typically seen in pure tropical cyclones. Satellite observations also revealed that although the lower wind circulation was distinct, it had become intertwined with the cyclonic vortex aloft to its southwest, confirming the hybrid nature of the system. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) thus classified the system as a subtropical depression at 06:00 UTC on October 6, when it was 265 mi (425 km) north- northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The depression slid slowly northwestward between the contiguous upper vortex and a large high-pressure region over the central Atlantic. A region of lighter wind shear ahead, as well as an anticipated weakening of the upper cyclone, prompted the NHC to introduce the possibility of a tropical transition. Later, satellite observations showed a rapid improvement in the depression's structure; convective banding wrapped completely around the broad inner wind field, which produced gusts to 65 mph (105 km/h). Accordingly, the NHC upgraded the depression to Subtropical Storm Otto at 21:00 UTC on October 6, about 215 mi (345 km) northeast of Grand Turk. Although satellite images continued to display a classical subtropical cyclone, with Otto's center and the vortex aloft nearly collocated, data from a Hurricane Hunters aircraft indicated a weak warm convective core was developing within the mid levels of the circulation‚Äîa feature normally present at the upper levels of tropical cyclones. Moreover, a contraction of the large wind field reaffirmed that Otto was entering the final stages of its tropical transition. Although convective activity briefly weakened overnight, weakening shear and considerably warmer sea surface temperatures permitted small patches of thunderstorms to refire on the morning of October 7. As Otto meandered northward, temperature contrasts from forecast models indicated that the warm core within the circulation had ascended to the upper levels of the cyclone. In consequence, a burst of deep, tropical convection with extreme cloud top temperatures of approximately ‚àí112¬∞ F (‚àí80¬∞ C) occurred over the center. Having shed the last of its subtropical characteristics, Otto became a warm- core system and was operationally declared tropical at 1200 UTC that day. Hurricane Otto weakening over the Atlantic on October 9 Over the course of October 8, Otto began to accelerate to the northeast under the increasing influence of a vertically deep trough off the US East Coast. Conditions aloft remained conducive, and the storm's convection deepened symmetrically over the center to form a large, well-defined central dense overcast. By 1200 UTC, Otto's winds had reached 75 mph (120 km/h) while a mid-level eyewall began to form, prompting the NHC to upgrade the storm to a Category 1 hurricane south of Bermuda. Further strengthening ensued as the newly formed hurricane proceeded over the warm waters of the central Atlantic; microwave imagery revealed the eye, though obscured, was vertically well established, marking Otto's peak strength with estimated winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). Upon peaking in intensity, Otto had become fully embedded within the deep-layered flow to its southwest. Racing northeastward, the hurricane entered an area of progressively cooler waters and adverse upper atmospheric conditions, which eroded its cloud pattern and disrupted the circulation. With maximum winds dropping below 70 mph (110 km/h), Otto was reduced to a tropical storm late on October 9. Convective activity came to a near halt due to relentless wind shear and a lack of tropical moisture, leading specialists to conclude the storm was entering an extratropical transition. The next day, the cool dry air infiltrated the weak warm core, and Otto began to develop frontal banding features. With these characteristics, Otto became an extratropical cyclone on October 10, and the NHC discontinued advisories on the storm. The post- tropical system decelerated near the Azores over the next week, where it eventually degenerated into a remnant low that recurved sharply southeastward, before completely dissipating west of Morocco on October 18. Preparations and impact Otto shortly after completing tropical cyclogenesis Otto and its precursor disturbance produced days of prolonged rainfall and gusty winds across the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Localized flooding and rough sea conditions caused extensive road damage, infrastructure failures, and some beach erosion along coastlines. During the passage of the storm, numerous residents were left without water and power, and a state of emergency was declared for several Caribbean nations. Schools, businesses and some government offices across all of the Virgin Islands and Saint Kitts and Nevis were closed until storm conditions abated. The weather system ultimately accounted for substantial monetary losses throughout these areas, pinned at over $22.5 million (2010 USD). In addition, Otto was widely regarded as one of the wettest storms in the history of the northeastern Caribbean, repeatedly shattering various rainfall records. =Leeward Islands= In Saint Lucia, downpours triggered torrential flooding along the island's easternmost coast from October 5 through October 6. In Dennery Quarter, flash floods affected about 500 households; among them, 400 had their houses flooded or severely damaged. Several residences had to be evacuated, and some people were trapped in their homes. Residents also suffered from the absence of drinking water, lack of electricity, and the inability to prepare meals due to the loss of kitchen equipment and other utensils. In response, the area was declared a disaster zone; a total of EC$500,000 ($185,185 USD) was approved to assist flood victims, as well as an additional US$44,194 allocated from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Intermittent torrents battered Saint Kitts and Nevis for at least four days; a total of up to 10.99 inches (279 mm) of precipitation was recorded during that time. Several homeowners reported significant flooding, and a number of persons had to be rescued from their homes. Gusty winds generated rough sea conditions along coastal regions, resulting in some beach erosion and the collapse of a sidewalk section. Rains and associated floods topped a number of culverts and bridges, washed out the sides of some roadways, and damage to some utility lines, followed by significant disruptions to electricity services. The exact amount of damage to the territory remains unknown, however. Subtropical Depression Seventeen to the north of Puerto Rico, with its long rainband reaching into the northeastern Caribbean In the U.S. Virgin Islands, heavy rainfall associated with Otto shattered numerous records for October across the US Virgin Islands, with a maximum total of 21.52 in (547 mm) reported in Red Hook, Saint Tomas. The rain flooded roads and prompted officials opened shelters on all three islands on October 6. In Saint Croix, a roadway section leading into Enfield Green collapsed, temporarily cutting the neighborhood off to traffic until a makeshift roadway was created the next day. In La Vall√©e, on the island's north shore, floods and landslides affected low-lying areas. Traffic on Saint Thomas and Saint John initially remained unhindered; however, as the rain continued for several days, flooding, rockslides and asphalt erosion forced authorities to close several roads and highways. Damage estimates from the storm reached $2 million across the islands. In the British Virgin Islands, a flash flood warning was in effect during the presence of Otto from October 6 to 8. Torrential floods across the islands overturned several cars, and caused extensive damage to utility lines and drainage pipes; dozens of people in Tortola‚Äîspecifically in Road Town‚Äîwere temporarily left without power and water. In total, an estimated 24.98 inches (634 mm) of rain was recorded, and the government declared a state of emergency for the entire territory. Floods from the storm were regarded as the worst in the history of the British Virgin Islands. In total, damage across the islands was estimated at US$10.5 million, considerably higher than losses ensured by major Hurricane Earl earlier in the year. Widespread flooding from Otto was responsible for substantial increases in damage to the road network across Sint Maartin initially wrought by Earl, amounting to NA∆í1.5 million ($838,000 USD). On the French side of the island nation, torrents and associated floods in Saint Martin were accountable for similar property infrastructural damage; monetary losses there totaled ‚Ç¨800,000 ($1.12 million USD). =Puerto Rico= Storm total rainfall related to Otto in Puerto Rico Rain began to pour across several parts of Puerto Rico on October 5, persisting for up to five days in some areas. The greatest amount of rainfall during the six-day period of October 3 to 8 was registered at Rio Portugues in Ponce, with recorded. Due to the rainfall, the Government of Puerto Rico issued the closure of more than 40 roads, and an additional 19 streets were partially secured. Subsequent widespread flooding affected at least 295 roads, 14 of which suffered significant damage. In all, damage to road infrastructure was preliminarily estimated at US$6.5 million. In addition, the municipality of Ponce reported copious losses in agriculture, later estimated at US$1.5 million. Following the overflow of the Arecibo River on October 7, a neighborhood in Utuado was cut off from surrounding communities after gushing waters severely damaged its main road. Shortly thereafter, a landslide lugged a utility pole along the road, making it impossible for larger vehicles‚Äîincluding ambulances‚Äîto access the site. Landslides trapped fourteen families in the municipality of Ponce; a residence alongside a road suffered significant damage and had to be evacuated. In Cayey, a district was isolated from neighboring areas due to the collapse of a bridge. In the area, burst riverbanks triggered floods across local streets, which trapped dozens of families in their homes. Severe flooding contaminated water supplies, leaving an estimated 45,000 people without drinking water in the wake of the storm. In response, the government declared a state of emergency for the entire island. Authorities opened 120 shelters, and several flood victims had to be rescued.

The episode originally aired October 20, 2010. It was written by series co-creator Steven Levitan and directed by Michael Spiller. The episode follows Phil, Claire and the kids trying to improve their communication skills by giving up their electronic devices. Gloria is getting obsessed over a neighbor's barking dog while Mitchell and Cameron try to find a preschool for Lily. \\"Unplugged\\" received a mix of critical acclaim and negative reviews. The episode also received controversy in Peru because of a line of dialogue of Vergara's character in which she relates Peruvians with violence. According to the Nielsen Media Research the episode received a 4.7 rating/13% share in the 18-49 demographic going down a tick from the previous episode, \\"Strangers on a Treadmill\\" Plot After getting tired of the over use of electronic gadgets at the table, Claire (Julie Bowen) and Phil (Ty Burrell) declare that no one is allowed to use electronics except the TV for a week. However, Phil turns it into a contest much to Claire's annoyance, and offers prizes: A car for Haley (Sarah Hyland), a new computer for Alex (Ariel Winter) and a chicken pot pie for Luke (Nolan Gould). Alex and Luke quickly give up leaving Phil, Claire and Haley in the contest. Claire soon gets tired of calling to check on reservations to go see Phil's family and uses the computer before getting caught. Not long after, Claire and Phil catch Haley talking on the phone which prompts Phil to use the computer right away. However, Haley reveals to them she was only talking to a fake phone that she carved out of a bar of soap and colored black. As she celebrates that she is getting a new car, she is informed that her parents were bluffing. The Pritchetts get annoyed by a neighbor's dog and go next door to see if he will shut the dog up. The neighbor says that the dog belongs to his soon-to-be-ex-wife, and that she will not be coming back for it. He also demands that they shut their parrot up (he had mistaken Gloria's high pitched voice with the squawking of a parrot). Suddenly the dog goes missing, and Jay (Ed O'Neill) assumes that Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) killed it (her family in Colombia were butchers so she is very used to killing animals, and Jay had witnessed that she killed a rat in the house with a shovel). He asks Manny (Rico Rodriguez) if he thinks she did anything, which he initially denies. At night, Jay and Manny go to the garage to look for evidence of the dog's murder. Manny rats out Jay's plan to Gloria making her very angry. Gloria tells Jay that she gave the dog to a friend for a jar of pickles. To make her happy, Jay buys plane tickets to Colombia to see what her village is like. She says in an interview she does not want to go to her old village as it will prove Jay right. Meanwhile, Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) learn that all of Lily's friends have been put in preschool causing the couple to panic. Mitchell calls Claire to see if Wagon Wheel is a good school and asks her if she can get them an appointment. At Wagon Wheel the assistant tells them with their diversity (Mitchell and Cameron being gay and Lily being Asian) they can get into any preschool. Mitchell starts calling Cameron his life partner to seem even more diverse to make it into Billingsley, the expensive school nicknamed \\"the Harvard of preschools.\\" They soon become beaten at their own game by an interracial, disabled lesbian couple with an adopted African American child. Cameron pretends to be one sixteenth Cherokee to seem more diverse in their interview. They eventually decide to go to Wagon Wheel after bombing the interview. Production The episode was written by co-creator, Steven Levitan & directed by Michael Spiller. The episode alluded to a trip to Colombia that the cast (especially Sof√≠a Vergara) had been hoping the producers would announce. The episode would serve as a sequel to \\"Hawaii\\". Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Unplugged\\" was viewed by an estimated 11.972 million households without DVR viewership making it the third most viewed program of the night. The episode received a 7.1 rating/11% share among overall viewers and a 4.7 rating/13% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 leading its timeslot in the demographic and becoming second in its timeslot for total viewership. If you were to include DVR viewership, the episode was watched by 14.82 million viewers and received a 6.2 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode went down a tick from the previous episode, \\"Strangers on a Treadmill\\". Despite dropping in the demographic the series became the highest rated scripted series of the week between October 17 and October 23. =Reviews= The episode received mostly positive reviews. Jason Hughes of AOL's TV Squad stated in his review \\"While 'Modern Family' is consistently one of the funniest half hours on television, it's rarely as well-balanced as this episode.\\" Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a positive review. Despite feeling it didn't have a \\"mushy center\\" he also felt \\"it's Modern Family's balancing act between the absurd and the relatable that has made it a sitcom for the ages.\\" Kara Klenc of TV Guide called the episode \\"laugh out loud\\". She also stated \\"I laughed out loud at so many moments of this episode, there are barely any shows that can do that anymore!\\" Henry Hanks of CNN gave the episode a positive review and also stated \\"This week, all three plots were equally strong, but I have to admit, I'm really looking forward to next week's Halloween episode even more.\\" Mickey O'Conner of TV Guide named Cameron and Mitchell's interview the fifth best TV moment of the week. Matt Roush gave the episode a positive review. Despite criticizing the writers \\"painting\\" Mitchell as a \\"shallow social climber\\" he also stated \\"that the storyline is quickly redeemed in yet another hilarious episode\\". Despite these positive reviews Brett Singer of The A.V. Club rated the episode with a B-. He felt the episode was \\"rushed\\" due to the plotlines not \\"overlapping\\". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix gave the episode a negative review as well saying \\"I didn't laugh at the Dunphy plot\\" and \\"I hated hated hated the Cam/Mitchell plot\\", but also praised the Pritchett plot. =Peruvian controversy= The episode received controversy for Gloria's statement \\"Ah, here we go.

The fort covers an area of and occupies the summit of the hill on the edge of Salisbury Plain, with its four-sided shape largely following the natural contours of the hill. The Iron Age hillfort dates to around 100 BC, but contains the remains of an earlier and smaller D-shaped enclosure or camp. The age of this earlier earthwork is currently subject to debate, and has been variously interpreted due to the inconclusive and incomplete nature of previous and differing excavation records; it may be early Iron Age dating to around 250 BC, but it has also been interpreted as being Bronze Age, dating to around 2000 BC. There are seven tumuli located within the enclosure of the fort, which were excavated in the 19th century by Sir Richard Colt Hoare and William Cunnington. Finds from excavations at that time included relics of bone, pottery, flint, brass, and amber jewellery, most of which can be seen today at the Wiltshire Museum in Devizes. Other items of interest have been found in and around the site including Roman artefacts and neolithic flint and jade axe heads. The site is listed on Wiltshire Council's Sites and Monuments Record with number ST94SW200, and is also a scheduled monument number SM10213. The hillfort falls within a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, designated as Scratchbury & Cotley Hills SSSI, which encompasses a total of , being first SSSI notified in 1951. Etymology The name of the hill could be derived from a number of old English words and meanings, the etymology of which are ambiguous and open to interpretation, given the differing sources. One possibility is that the name is derived from the words scratch, an old West Country word for the Devil; and bury, from the Old English word beorg, meaning a mound or hill, or sometimes a defense; although it could also be derived from CrechSamuel Lewis, pp 501-505 or Crechen meaning a hill, and burh, meaning a fortified town or a defended site. Description =Iron Age hillfort= Pencil sketch of Scratchbury camp by Sir Richard Colt-Hoare, 1810. The seven tumuli within the hill fort are also shown.Sir Richard Colt Hoare, p.70 The steeply contoured sides of Scratchbury Hill form natural defences to the north, west and southwestern sides, and in part to a small area of the eastern flank. Elsewhere on the hill the contours are less steep and afford easier access, with the southeastern boundary merging into the adjacent Cotley Hill with only a small change in level. The Iron Age fortifications at Scratchbury Camp consist of a single large ditch and rampart to the most steeply contoured flanks, with some secondary counterscarps to the more accessible sides.Sir Richard Colt Hoare, pp 69-71 The fort, as measured from the ramparts, has a circumference of The inner earthworks are typical of a \\"quarry-ditch\\" formation, whereby the material excavated from the inner ditch is used to create the rampart.J.Forde-Johnston, p. 129 Within the quarry ditch numerous curvilinear and circular depressions may represent remains of structures. The fortifications are best preserved on the western side of the hill where the ditch is between wide and up to deep. The banks and ditches are generally uneven in height and depth, which is thought to be evidence for a 'gang dug' construction of the earthworks. Elsewhere, the enclosure is defined by a bank in height above the ditch bottom, the ditch being wide and up to deep. On parts of the eastern side of the fort the ditch is absent and is replaced by a ledge of between wide. There are two original entrances to the fort on the eastern side, and a possible third on the northwest side. The southeastern entrance has earthwork marks representing possible outer fortifications, and is approached from the adjacent Cotley Hill by a narrow ridge of land referred to as Burberry Much of the north and west areas of the interior appear to have been densely settled, as demonstrated by the traces of approximately 100 probable structures. These survive mainly as shallow circular hollows of between in diameter and up to deep. The best preserved is a rectangular platform immediately within the southern terminal of the western entrance. The location and unusual morphology suggests a special function for this structure, and it is perhaps plausible that a 'guard chamber' or sentry was positioned here. Detail of the northeast flank earthwork defences at Scratchbury Camp =Earlier enclosure= Within the centre of the hillfort lies the remains of an earlier and smaller D-shaped inner earthwork enclosure of circa , and excavated by E.C.Curwen in 1930.E.C.Curwen, pg 38 Today, all that really remains of this enclosure is one well defined lynchet of approximately high along the southern section. This feature bears a resemblance to a similar such enclosure at Yarnbury Castle, and was originally interpreted by Curwen to be a Neolithic causewayed enclosure due to its interrupted nature, and the discovery at the site of jade and flint axes. Subsequent excavations by Grimes in 1957F.K.Annable, pg 17 re-interpreted this feature to be an earlier Iron Age enclosure dating to approximately 250 BC, with Iron Age pottery found within the primary fill. It was therefore speculated that the visible interruptions have been made by post Medieval ploughing. Faint traces of a remnant bank survive along the north and west sections, and an adjoining ditch has a causewayed nature, and survives in short segments varying between in length. There is also evidence of a single original west facing entrance currently discernible as a wide gap in the enclosure boundary. The straight southeastern side of the enclosure is formed by a ditch that is truncated by the main hillfort boundary, and this again has been interpreted as further evidence that the linear ditch and contiguous enclosure pre-date the main hillfort. However, more recent aerial and photographic surveys have meant that W.F.Grimes' re-interpretation may have been in error. A detailed survey undertaken between 1994 and 1995 by the field survey teams of the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England have suggested that the feature is in fact more likely to be a Neolithic causewayed enclosure as originally interpreted by E.C.Curwen. One possible explanation for the apparent confusion in dating this feature is that Grimes may not have excavated fully to the primary fill. The surveys suggest that the feature clearly has causeways, and low winter sun photography shows that the enclosure continues beyond what was previously believed to be its eastern edge, to form a sub-circular rather than D-shaped enclosure feature.\\"Salisbury Plain Training Area: A report for the National Mapping Programme\\", Simon Crutchley, published by English Heritage, 2000 The 'crop mark' visible on aerial photographs shows a continuation of the curve to the southeast of the straight side, thus roughly completing a circle. This feature has also been interpreted as a possible base for a palisaded enclosure. There is also a probable link between the likely neolithic causewayed enclosure and the surrounding barrow cemetery, which would have followed later. =Later features= There is also a Romano-British or later ditch, running east to west, which turns south sharply at the southwest corner of the hillfort, and which partly overlies the earlier Iron Age earthworks. The main ramparts appear to have been built in the 1st century BC. =Construction phases= Drawing of finds from the Scratchbury Grave Group, 1869; William Pilsbury after Richard Colt-Hoare (1758‚Äì1838); Watercolour on paper, 26.7 x 17.8 (cm); located at the Society of Antiquaries of London The archaeological evidence suggests that Scratchbury Camp was built in at least two but perhaps three phases. It is generally well accepted that the first phase of construction is defined by the curvilinear portion of the interior 'D'-shaped enclosure, but whether there were distinct second and third Iron Age phases, or merely a re- alignment in the second phase, it is unclear. The scarp subdividing the early fort is a possible indication of a second phase, but this may have been the setting out for a bank that was never utilised. In its third and final phase it seems possible that the fort, having been 'laid out' to include the large barrow, was then further extended to encompass the whole of the top of the hill, to make full defensive use of the natural slopes and resulting in the present day configuration. Archaeology Excavations at the site have revealed many items from Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Romano-British periods. Most of the finds are now preserved at the Wiltshire Museum in Devizes. Most recently, Professor William Francis Grimes partially excavated the inner earthworks on the site in the 1950s. Finds included Iron Age pottery. In 1880 two Bronze Age axes were apparently found on or near Scratchbury Camp. Both are in private collection; one is a socketed type axe and the other resembles a late North European (Montelius 6) type. Sir Richard Colt Hoare also records the discoveries of a neolithic jade axe and a ground flint axe, along with various 'British and Roman' pottery inside the camp, as excavated by William Cunnington in 1802. The jade axe is described by the archaeologist Kenneth Oakley as resembling Australian Aboriginal implements. The flint axe is of polished white flint, with the end re-chipped, and was found at the entrance to Scratchbury Camp. It measures long, by wide, and high. The hillfort also contains seven bowl barrow tumuli within its boundaries, and a possible eighth just outside it, referenced as the Scratchbury Grave group, or the Scratchbury Hill Group, and which were excavated between 1802 and 1804 by Sir Richard Colt Hoare and William Cunnington. However, as the three-age system had not been introduced at that time, they were unable to date their finds and therefore were at a disadvantage when trying to interpret them. The tumuli were re-recorded in the 1957 surveys by W.F. Grimes. Descriptions from the reports and writings of Sir Richard Colt-Hoare and William Cunnington are given in the table below. {| style=\\"text-align:center;width:100%\\" border=\\"1\\" |+A record of the Scratchbury Grave Group bowl barrow tumuli located within Scratchbury Camp, and associated finds !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:75px;\\"|WM ref no.WM = Wiltshire Museum references !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:60px;\\"|RCH* ref no.RCH = Original Sir Richard Colt-Hoare numbering !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:60px;\\"|SHG* ref no.SHG = Scratchbury Hill Group numbering !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:50px;\\"|Dia. !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:50px;\\"|Height !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:160px;\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"|Images !scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"|Description |- !scope=\\"row\\" |Norton Bavant Tumuli G1 1 SH-05  |150px 150px |Found to contain a cist within which was an interment of burned bones.

The bone pin was possibly designed to be worn in the hair, whilst the holes in the bone plate suggest that it could have been designed for attachment to another material, or used for holding cords of material together. Sir Richard Colt Hoare's original interpretation as being a possible wristguard seems unlikely as the material would have been too brittle for this purpose.Thomas, pg 314 |- !scope=\\"row\\" |Norton Bavant Tumuli G3 |3 |SH-07  No recorded finds. |- !scope=\\"row\\" |Norton Bavant Tumuli G4 |7 |SH-04  |150px |The largest tumuli on the site and very conspicuous from the road below.

On the crown of Cotley Hill is a further Bronze Age tumulus surrounded by an Iron Age enclosure. Nearby to the northwest, on the side of Middle Hill, is the site of the deserted medieval village of Middleton, whose surviving earthworks consist of building platforms cut into lynchets and enclosed by a boundary bank and ditch, and a hollow-way. There are also signs of strip lynchets immediately to the north of Scratchbury Camp on the side of the hill. A Roman bronze spoon was found on or near Scratchbury Camp in 1804,R.B.Pugh, E.Critall, pg 93 and a Roman urn was found in the surrounding area before 1856 Geography 1817 Ordnance Survey Map of Scratchbury Camp Scratchbury is on the edge of the chalk plateau of Salisbury Plain, and within the area of Norton Bavant Chalk Downland Edge, as described by the West Wiltshire Landscape Character Assessment. The hill has extensive views overlooking the Wylye valley to the south. The Salisbury Plain chalk massif is part of a system of chalk downlands throughout eastern and southern England formed by the rocks of the Chalk Group; the landscape is underlain by a combination of Lower, Middle and Upper Chalk supporting shallow well drained calcareous silty soils over chalk on slopes and crests. Escarpments are often formed where layers of chalk have been compressed to form a fold, or where the chalk has been faulted, resulting in accelerated erosion along the line of the weakness. For the Norton Bavant Chalk Downland Edge, the 'character' of this area encompasses three distinctive, steeply sloping hills (Middle Hill, Scratchbury Hill, and Cotley Hill), which form a distinct and somewhat isolated unit of Chalk Downland Edge. The hills are covered with long fields, which are predominantly arable, with occasional patches of rough remnant chalk grassland and scrub on the tops of the hills. Many chalk grassland slopes in England show the mark of centuries of grazing by sheep, the slopes bearing a stepped or striped appearance formed by a mixture of soil creep and sheep paths, and such erosion is visible on the slopes of Scratchbury Hill. Regular patches and belts of mixed woodland populate parts of the lower slopes. Imber military range perimeter paths run across the top of the hills, providing public access to the area. Ecology Scratchbury Camp as viewed from the southwest: the distinctive features of Scratchbury Hill, including the ramparts of the hill fort and one of the taller barrows, are clearly defined Scratchbury is within in an area of unimproved grassland on the edge of Salisbury Plain, which is the largest remaining area of calcareous grassland in north-west Europe. The local area supports a rich and diverse grassland flora along with an important associated butterfly fauna, and this led to it being notified as a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1951. Designated as Scratchbury & Cotley Hills SSSI, the site encompasses a total of . The ecology and historical agricultural use of the site is such that regular grazing by sheep is required to maintain the balance of the flora, and to control the growth of shrubs. The grassland is generally dominated by sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), red fescue (Festuca rubra), and upright brome (Bromus erectus). There are also several varieties of herbs, characteristic to the Wiltshire downland, including for devil's bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), saw-wort (Serratula tinctoria), and chalk milkwort (Polygala calcarea). There are also many other native and site specific plants, including for orchids, meadow grasses, nettles, and other flora. On the steep slopes horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa), Thymus, and Asperula is plentiful Within the hillfort, a more mesotrophic grassland is present, most probably reflecting past agricultural use and improvement. There are also small areas of hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), and elder (Sambucus) scrub, particularly along the lower slopes of the downland and on the earthworks. These provide valuable shelter for invertebrates on an otherwise open and exposed site. The Adonis blue butterfly can be found on and around Scratchbury Camp The site is of high entomological interest, with 29 varieties of resident breeding species of butterfly recorded. The horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) is locally plentiful and supports both the chalkhill blue (Lysandra coridon) and the Adonis blue (Lysandra bellargus) butterflies. Other butterfly species to be found on and around the site include for the Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina), the grizzled skipper (Pyrgus malvae), the dark green fritillary (Speyeria aglaja), and the small blue (Cupido minimus). Other insect groups on the site are less well surveyed, but several rare species have been recorded, including for six species of weevil (Curculionoidea), eight species of plant bugs (Hemiptera), and two species of chrysomelid beetle, Aphthona herbigrada and Mantura matthewsii; both of which feed on the rock rose (Helianthemum). Day-flying moths recorded include for the wood tiger (Parasemia plantaginis), and the rare forester moth (Jordanita globulariae). Small mammals such as rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and badgers (Meles meles) are common to the site and the surrounding area. Poetry Siegfried Sassoon The English poet and author Siegfried Sassoon (1886‚Äì1967), who lived nearby at Heytesbury House, wrote about Scratchbury Camp on a June day in 1942, capturing the ambience of the Wiltshire Downs on a summer's day, whilst touching on the pervasive military presence of that age and the historical timelessness of the area. Location The site is located at , to the east of the town of Warminster and to the north of the village of Norton Bavant, in the county of Wiltshire. The hill has a summit of AOD. Nearby to the northwest lies Middle Hill, and further northwest the hillfort of Battlesbury Camp, on Battlesbury Hill. To the southeast lies Cotley Hill. The site and surrounding downs are easily accessible by public footpath: the Wessex Ridgeway and the Imber Range perimeter path follow the northern ramparts of the fort, however care must be taken not to stray into the military firing ranges of Salisbury Plain immediately to the northeast. Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty lies to the south.

You're Dead is a 1954 British psychological film drama, directed by Lance Comfort and starring Jack Warner, Anthony Richmond, Veronica Hurst, Derek Farr and Sean Barrett. The film takes as its subject the accidental killing of a man by a child, and the struggles of the child and his companion to comprehend the gravity of what has happened. Plot Seven year old Cliff Bonsell (Richmond) lives a lonely life with his very elderly and widowed father (Warner) in a hut on a decommissioned American army munitions stores depot in rural England. Cliff has few friends, his main companion being the slightly older Willy Maxted (Barrett), a quiet and introverted child who lives nearby with his grandmother (Beatrice Varley). Cliff has developed a fascination for guns from films he has seen, regarding them as fun toys with which to play imaginative games. Willy's main interest is his gramophone and a single recording : \\"Lazy Day\\". Cliff discovers an old army service revolver left behind at the depot and is thrilled to have found a realistic toy to play with. He and Willy are out together when they come across unpopular local Ben Jones (Philip Saville). Cliff decides to tease him by threatening him with the gun cowboy-style. When Jones refuses to play along, Cliff pulls the trigger, not realising that the gun is still loaded with live bullets. Jones collapses and the pair at first think he is play-acting, but soon realise that he is dead. They flee the scene in panic. Jones's body is discovered shortly afterwards by Bob Carter (Michael Medwin), who alerts the local police. Carter also finds the gun and pockets it. However, when investigating detective Gray (Derek Farr) learns that Carter and Jones had recently been involved in a fight over the attentions of the flirtatious Hilda (Veronica Hurst), Carter becomes the main suspect and is taken in for questioning. Cliff and Willy become increasingly tormented as they try to weigh up whether it is better to let an innocent man be punished, or to confess to what actually happened and face what they see as the fearful consequences. Meanwhile, Grey gradually comes to realise that the case may not be as clear-cut as it first appeared.

Singapore's participation in the World Expo 2010 was its largest to date at the World Expo, signifying its strong and close bilateral ties with China. The Singapore pavilion showcased Singapore's achievements in urban planning, water technology and environmental services while promoting closer people-to-people relations between China and Singapore. The pavilion also highlighted Singapore's ability to offer a high-quality and integrated environment to live, work and play within a compact area through sustainable planning and development.\\"Singapore Pavilion World Expo 2010 Shanghai China\\" , Singapore Tourism Board 2010 Singapore pavilion The Singapore pavilion was designed to resemble a \\"music box\\", whose sound could be heard by visitors even before they entered. Its exhibition sections of different shapes were linked by gentle slopes and stairs. It integrated different design elements - music fountain, audio visual interplay and distinctive flowers on the roof garden, manifesting the harmony between cities and nature, as well as Singapore's originality and diverse cultures. Four columns of varying sizes supported its structural system and floors above, symbolising Singapore‚Äôs races living, working and playing together on the same ground. Ramps and stairs suspended off trusses led to the upper floors.Expo 2010 Shanghai China Official Guidebook: pp78 Theme The theme Urban Symphony () was inspired by the harmony of unique elements in Singapore: Progress and sustainability, urbanisation and greenery, tradition and modernity and the different races living in harmony together. The two environmental areas that Singapore has successfully made headway with in balancing progress with sustainability ‚Äì water and garden ‚Äì formed the softscape of the pavilion as its two design elements. Design The ground floor of the pavilion showcased projected images, live theatre performances and activities within the atrium space and main hall. Singapore exhibits were also displayed along the ramp up to the next floor. A 600sqm column-free second floor hosted an amphitheatre screening videos of Singapore to reveal lesser known aspects beyond its economic success, such as its creativity, cultural diversity and natural beauty. * There 'A Garden in the Sky' ‚Äì a roof- top garden of tropical flora landscaped to re-capture the essence and the beauty of living in a garden city. * Urban Symphony aimed to articulate Singapore‚Äôs rhythm and beat through the Pavilion‚Äôs architecture of water fountain movements, window and sunshade fins layouts on the fa√ßade, interplay of sounds and visuals on different levels and a m√©lange of flora on the roof garden. * In line with the theme of sustainability, recyclable materials such as aluminum and steel were used for the facade and structural framework, and the foundation made of spun piles with only the foundations, floor slabs and columns built of reinforced concrete. * The design incorporated fa√ßade slits and chilled water along the perimeter of the ground floor to encourage a cool breeze in the heat of summer and to reduce energy consumption on air- conditioning. Dendrobium Singapore Shanghai Symphony Dendrobium Singapore Shanghai Symphony () is an orchid hybrid exclusively created to commemorate Singapore‚Äôs participation in the World Expo 2010 Shanghai China. The striking jade and gold-hued hybrid is adorned with delicate parallel veins, symbolising the beauty of Singapore and Shanghai and the two cities‚Äô correspondent transformation into vibrant global destinations. The resilient nature of the hybrid reflects the strong bilateral relations between China and Singapore who joined together at the World Expo 2010 Shanghai China to share approaches to innovation and sustainable development. It also underlined the Singapore Pavilion‚Äôs overarching theme Urban Symphony. Logo The visually distinctive and endearingly memorable Singapore Pavilion logo was conceived by Singapore design firm Epigram. The logo, inspired by the pavilion design and musical instruments, such as the chimes, piano and xylophone, resonated with the serendipity, fun and delight that awaited visitors to Singapore‚Äôs Urban Symphony. The colour red, which represents Singapore, evokes passion and featured prominently in the logo design. The element of red in Singapore‚Äôs national flag symbolises \\"universal brotherhood and equality of man‚Äù. Traditionally, in Chinese culture red is also widely known as an auspicious colour, associated with happiness. The colour gradient in the logo embodied Singapore‚Äôs continuous efforts to balance sustainability and innovation amidst the urban vibrancy of our city state‚Äôs transforming landscape. Grey echoed the island-state‚Äôs modernity. Mascot Drawing inspiration from Singapore's iconic Merlion and The King of Fruits, the Durian, Singapore Tourism Board conceived Liu Lian Xiao Xing as mascot. Liu Lian Xiao Xing is a five-year-old Singaporean boy who travels around the world with his musician parents. In 2010, his parents will be travelled to Shanghai for the World Expo 2010, allowing Liu Lian Xiao Xing to realise his dream of visiting China. The Liu Lian Xiao Xing character was an open, friendly and upbeat boy whose friends loved having him around because he was always so bubbly and makes them laugh. An inquisitive boy with endless questions, he was always learning, always eager for more and always seeking explanations. He wore red overalls emblazoned with a picture of the Merlion in homage to his favourite toy ‚Äì a Merlion beanie. His cap, shaped just like a durian was inspired by his love of the fruit and his sketches of the Esplanade! Liu Lian Xiao Xing loved to eat diverse and sumptious Singapore delights like black pepper and chilli crab durians, Hainanese chicken rice, laksa lemak and roti prata, and had recently discovered a new favourite dish, Shanghainese xiao long bao. He was fond of drawing durians as well as his favourite building, the iconic Esplanade ‚Äì Theatre on the Bay, one of the world's busiest arts centres, hiking at the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, picnicking at the Botanic Gardens with his family. He enjoyed playing the piano, violin and ethnic instruments such the Chinese erhu and the Indian tabla which he learnt from his parents.

Development Leonard Warden Bonney was an early aviator, who flew with the Wright Exhibition Team as early as 1910. An experienced aviator with service in the First World War, Bonney set out to develop a plane with more efficient wings and controls than contemporary aircraft. Noting the gull's two to one lift to weight ratio, he set about molding gull wings for their shape. Construction took place over the course of five years. The ideas were tested in MIT and the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aeronautics wind tunnels. Design A 1928 issue of Time magazine described the unusual aircraft: > It was fat in body with graceful curving wings. Bonney followed the bird > principle, abandoned the aileron, or balancing contrivance which airplane > designers have always considered an essential feature of stability in the > air. His plane had new features: an expanding and contracting tail, like a > blackbird's, for varying loads; variable camber in the wings, so that they > could flatten out like a gull's when flying level; a varying angle of > incidence to its wings, so that they could turn sideways into the wind on > landing... The Gull was assembled at the Kirkham facility in Garden City, New York and Mitchel Field. It used conventional landing gear, a mid-wing arrangement, corrugated aluminum skins, and a radial engine. The cockpit featured a large streamlined greenhouse bubble with two seats. The large tailwheel was steerable and fully faired. The tail used small vertical stabilizers, with large elevators that could be swept back in flight. The aircraft profile was not unusual for the era with the exception of the highly tapered and swept back wings with a large dihedral and large tapered tail surfaces. Some features seemed far-fetched, but were actually ahead of their time. The wings mounted flush with the aircraft, but had a mechanism which allowed them to rotate in angle of incidence, as well as fold rearward from ten degrees of sweep to forty five degrees for braking and storage. These features were incorporated on future carrier aircraft such as the Fairey Firefly for storage rather than braking and flight control. Variable incidence mechanisms are used commonly to trim tail surfaces, however some aircraft such as the Vought F-8 Crusader have deployed the concept in practical use. The variable sweep mechanism can be seen on some high-speed aircraft such as the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark to expand their flight envelope. Bonney used differential sweep for roll control. Operational history Bonney was unable to find a willing test pilot and chose to fly the aircraft himself. He performed a test hop, damaging the landing gear once. On 4 May 1928 Bonney took up another aircraft on a flight, then announced he would test fly the Gull that day. Bonney was killed during the maiden flight when the aircraft nosedived into the ground from about 50 feet of altitude, seconds after taking off from Curtiss Field on Long Island. Path√© News was onsite to film the first flight. The newsreel shows the aircraft experiencing a roll to the left which was corrected, and a single oscillation in pitch before nosing straight down into the ground tossing out Bonney. Bonney was taken to Mineola Hospital where he died.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 and on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 1999. In 2019 it was included as a contributing property in the Davenport Motor Row and Industrial Historic District. History Davenport's first city charter in 1839 permitted the town's trustees to establish a fire department. Not long after, all the residents of the town were required to maintain two buckets for fire protection. It wasn‚Äôt until 1856 that volunteers were organized into the Independent Fire Engine and Hose Company, a privately operated organization. In the following years, a dozen other volunteer companies were formed, and a system of water mains and fire hydrants were put in that allowed for modern fire-fighting techniques. Hose Station No. 1 was built in 1877 and the following year it housed the Fire King Engine 2nd Hose Company, which was still a volunteer crew. In 1878 the team became known as Hose Company No. 1 when it became a paid unit. Hose Station No. 1 was replaced by the Central Fire Station when it opened in 1902. In 1912 St. Alphonsus Catholic Church in Davenport purchased the station's old bell and placed it in the new church building that was under construction at the time. The second floor of the building became the clubhouse of Battery B, First Artillery Inc., a group of National Guard veterans who served in the 1916 Mexican border campaign. The first floor housed automotive uses from the 1930s to the 1950s. The building, which had fallen into disrepair, was renovated in the late 20th century. Architecture Hose Station No. 1 was designed by Davenport architect John W. Ross. This is the earliest recorded commission of his. with Ross is also known for his other civic designs: Davenport City Hall and the 1886 Scott County Courthouse. Hose Station No. 1 is an Italianate structure built of red brick on a stone foundation. The rectangular structure has a central tower on the west elevation. The Italianate features of the building are the second- floor windows with their elongated shape, flat arch hoods, and 2/2 light configurations. The tower combines heavily hooded windows and there is a decorative brickwork cornice across the fa√ßade. Firefighting equipment was stored behind two large doors on the main level of the building. The second floor provided dormitory space for the firefighters. The tower was designed so the fire hoses could be hung to dry. The words ‚ÄúFire King‚Äù were displayed on the tower above the door.

Biography  Max and Thelma circa 1950 = Early years = Afford was born Thelma Thomas in Broken Hill to William James Thomas and Ethel (n√©e Henderson) in 1908. Her parents moved to Adelaide, where she attended the Presbyterian Girls' College, Glen Osmond. There she studied drawing and design, and became an art teacher at the South Australian School of Arts and Crafts. She acted between 1932 and 1934, then moved to Melbourne in 1934 to further study at Technical College. = Marriage to Max Afford = Max Afford and Thelma met when she was designing the costumes for his play Awake my Love performed at the Adelaide Tivoli Theatre, that won the centenary competition in 1936. The following year, Max was called to Sydney to work for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and Thelma moved to Sydney too to work for the sesqui-centenary celebrations. They married on 16 April 1938 at St Michael's church, Vaucluse, Sydney. They had no children. = Death and legacy = After Max's death in 1954, Thelma remained in Sydney where she lived until her death in 1996. At her death, Thelma left instructions to establish a fund with The Trust company for the attribution of an annual $10,000 \\"Max Afford Playwrights' Award\\" and a $7,500 \\"Thelma Afford Theatre, Stage, TV or Film Costume Design Award\\".  Professional life  Ballet costume for Adelaide‚Äôs Centenary Pageant, 1936, original watercolour by Thelma Thomas = Actress = In the early 1930s, Thelma Thomas was an actress in Adelaide, collaborating notably with the Ab-Intra Studio Theatre for Woman Song, The Robe of Yama, The Stained-Glass Window, and The Aspen Tree in 1932. In 1935, Thelma joined the Ab-Intra for their last show Archway Motif before the theatre closed indefinitely. = Designer = Thelma started designing theatre costumes in the early 1930s at the Ab-Intra Studio Theatre with Alan Harkness and Kester Baruch, and also at the Adelaide Repertory Theatre, where she worked with Agnes Dobson and Robert Helpmann. In 1934, she was commissioned to design for the Melbourne centenary pageant, then South Australia's centenary celebrations in 1936, and was later called to Sydney to design the costumes for the sesqui-centenary pageant. She enjoyed costume designing on a large scale, and added that \\"period costumes give a designer more scope than modern clothes\\".Melbourne Saturday Herald, 1 May 1937 She was resident designer at the Minerva Theatre from 1940 to 1950 and designed most of the costumes for Max's plays for the Independent Theatre. She also worked for the Garrick Theatre and the Tivoli Theatre in Melbourne. In 1949, she collaborated with Charles Chauvel on the film Sons of Matthew. Thelma then worked on the costume designs for a live dramatic production of Oscar Wilde's Importance of Being Earnest, broadcast 18 December 1957 on ABN-2. She remarked that costumes for TV were different than for the stage since the focus was on the upper-body of the actors instead of the silhouette, and the filming was in black-and-white, more precisely 9 shades of grey.Sydney Morning Herald TV Guide, 5 December 1957 The same year, she designed the costumes for Cinderella, the pantomime at the Elizabethan Theatre, praised for \\"its handsome costumes\\"Riddell, E.

Nelson is notable for having been editor in chief at the book industry's chief trade publication Publishers Weekly from 2005-2009 during a time of wrenching restructuring and industry downsizing. After that, she was book editor at Oprah's O Magazine. Her book So Many Books, So Little Time was published in 2003. Her views have been widely reported in numerous publications such as The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today, and she has appeared on television broadcasts including CBS's The Early Show. She has written for the Wall Street Journal and the Huffington Post about publishing industry trends and has been described as a \\"lively presence within the book publishing industry.\\" She is an extensive reader and has been described as a \\"lover of books.\\" Beginnings Nelson graduated from Yale in 1978 and Phillips Academy in Andover in 1974. She wrote about books and publishing at the New York Post, the New York Observer, Glamour magazine, and held editorial positions at Self, Inside.com, and Book Publishing Report. Nelson married and had a child and is a fierce advocate for respect for working mothers. Women struggled with ways to juggle careers and families, and stay-at-home moms and working mothers jostled over women's roles in the home, sometimes termed in the media as the Mommy Wars. Nelson wrote: Nelson, based on a New Year's plan, embarked on an ambitious project to read one book each week and write about it, and the effort morphed into a book entitled So Many Books, So Little Time: A Year of Passionate Reading which was published by Putnam in 2003. While her initial book-a-week plan fell apart almost immediately, according to New York Times book reviewer Ihsan Taylor, the effort was fruitful since the book was seen as a commentary on the \\"nature of reading itself.\\" Nelson's future employer, Publishers Weekly, reported that her book revealed her \\"infectious enthusiasm for literature in general.\\" Writer Augusten Burroughs said Nelson's book was a \\"smart, witty, utterly original memoir about how every book becomes a part of us.\\" Nelson has been a consistent heavy reader throughout her life, and at one point, in a YouTube interview, said that she typically reads about 50 books cover-to-cover per year regardless of her self-imposed commitment. She will only write about a book after she's read it completely, according to Nelson in the interview. Further, she reads portions of many books which are sent to her or recommended by others, sometimes only the first ten pages. She favors fiction over non- fiction generally, occasionally reading classics overlooked during her college years, and some non-fiction works such as David McCullough's treatment of American president John Adams. Publishers Weekly =Editor-in-chief= Nelson became editor-in-chief of the trade magazine Publishers Weekly in January 2005. It was a powerful position since the magazine is traditionally regarded as a standard bearer for mainstream critical opinion regarding books. A positive review from Publishers Weekly can bring a big sales boost to an unknown title, and the editor-in-chief's opinion about new books has considerable weight in the publishing industry. New York Times reporter Edward Wyatt suggested that the top job at Publishers Weekly in 2005 involved facing \\"many challenges\\". In her new position, Nelson added a new assessment for books called a signature review. She permitted greater variety in the length of reviews (typically 200 to 500 words long), considered bylines to reviews, and changes to the magazine's cover format. She hired graphic designer Jean- Claude Suares, added color using so-called drop down shadows behind color book covers, and wrote an editorial each week. She switched the magazine's logo to use the two letters PW since the abbreviation was well understood within the publishing world. She developed a nominating board of several thousand booksellers and librarians to nominate books for prizes in nineteen different categories; readers voted for books within stores or online, and the awards were termed the Quill awards. There was increased use of a foldout advertisement on the front cover, with the theme repeated inside the table of contents page. The first decade of the new century was marked by turbulence within the industry as well as a continuing trend away from serious writing and towards pop culture. Publishers Weekly had enjoyed a \\"near monopoly\\" over the past decades but was getting vigorous competition from Internet sites, e-mail newsletters and daily newspapers. The industry was consolidating. Many independent booksellers‚Äîa mainstay of Publishers Weekly clientele‚Äîwere going out of business. Paid circulation dropped by 3,000 to 25,000 in the mid 2000s. Nelson pushed for significant changes towards modernization, greater use of the Web, and more focus on analytical reporting. Nelson commented in an interview about how she saw PW evolving: Nelson, looking at business practices within the book publishing industry, saw problems. She speculated that the industry practice of printing too many books to \\"kind of create a buzz\\" and then having to ship books back from bookstores was inefficient. She saw a trend favoring so-called big books at the expense of lesser known writers: =Television's impact on publishing= Nelson noticed Oprah's impact on the book publishing industry, not knowing that the popular celebrity talk show host would one day be her employer. In 2008, Nelson commented on the intersection of political candidates, books, and television celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, not knowing that the talk show celebrity would be her employer within a year. There were several dozen books about then-candidate Obama. Nelson was interviewed on National Public Radio on Winfrey's influence, similar to that of radio personality Imus, in the publishing arena. She described Oprah: After a profound economic downturn beginning in 2007 and lasting for the next few years, the publishing industry slumped significantly. Nelson commented in 2008 how layoffs and salary freezes were \\"sobering\\". =Industry trends, digital books, self-publishing= Kindle is one of many new technologies affecting the publishing industry. Nelson owns one as well as a Sony Reader. Nelson wrote about such industry topics as Twitter writers signing book deals, Jonathan Littell's controversial 1,000 page Holocaust novel, and realignments of publishing firms. Nelson was quoted about sleeper hit books such as Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen as well as an expansion of what's considered to be chick lit which has grown to be more accomplished and \\"grown up,\\" according to Nelson. She commented on trends in changing technology, such as the coming of digital books such as Amazon's Kindle. She owns a Kindle and a Sony Reader and sees both as a \\"statement to the world that you like to read.\\" She said: Nelson identified other trends. Fewer places review books now, unfortunately, but there is more information available to consumers who may not want in-depth literary reviews of a book; rather, they want to know whether it's worth plunking down $25, and that's it. In some respects, according to Nelson, smaller publishers are better off than large houses which have huge budgets devoted to overhead; for example, Nelson said a small \\"mom and pop\\" publisher can do five books a year and be profitable. She still thinks it's tough times for people employed within the industry; she said \\"You can do all the right things and still lose your job.\\" She thinks business-to-business magazines will become available mostly online, and soon. In the past, self publishing was seen as the \\"exclusive realm of egomaniacs, eccentrics, and failures,\\" according to a reporter in the Los Angeles Times, but over the past decade or so it's become more popular and somewhat better accepted. Nelson commented in 2010 that there were more instances of publishers picking up a self-published book, although such success stories are still rare. \\"Publishers are taking self-published books more seriously,\\" she said. =Dismissal from Publishers Weekly= Then, in 2009, Nelson was dismissed from Publishers Weekly. She said: The action sent shockwaves through the industry and was widely covered in prominent newspapers. There was considerable reaction by readers as well. One reader wrote: \\"Sara Nelson turned Publishers Weekly around!\\" Another wrote that \\"Sara Nelson pulled Publishers Weekly into the 21st century with grace, verve, and panache. And I‚Äôve never met such a loud cheerleader for books and for the book publishing industry.\\" O Magazine In September 2009, Nelson was appointed book editor at Oprah's O Magazine.

Keenaram is believed to be the originator of the Aghori sect by some sources, however the sect has been mentioned in several ancient Hindu relegious texts. He was considered to be the incarnation of Lord Shiva. Aghoracharya Baba Keenaram was born on Aghor Chaturdashi (Bhadrapad) in 1601 A.D at Ramgarh village of Varanasi district (now Chandauli) of Uttar Pradesh state of India. The entire region became overjoyed when the childless couple Shree Akbar Singh and Mansa Devi finally got their child. After the birth, the child neither cried nor suckled at his mother's breast for three days. After three days when three monks (who were believed to be manifestations of Lord Sadashiva‚ÄîBrahma, Vishnu and Mahesh) came there, took the child in their arms and whispered something into his ears. Amazingly the child began to cry for the first time since birth. It is from that day onwards the Lolark Shashti festival is celebrated as Sanskar(Shashti, usually celebrated in Hindu religion after five days of birth) of Maharaj Shree (Baba Kinaram). With the blessing of Hinglaj Mata (Chief Goddess of Aghora) at Lyari district of Balochistan (Pakistan), Keenaram started his spiritual journey with the message of social welfare and humanity. Baba Kaluram known to be \\"Guru\\"(spiritual teacher) awakened the consciousness of \\"Aghor\\" in Keenaram. Later on Keenaram established himself in the city of Varanasi for the service of the people and enlightened them with the ancient wisdom. He has mentioned principles of Aghor in his books *Viveksar*, *Ramgita*, *Ramrasal* and *Unmuniram*. The book called *Viveksar* written by Baba Keenaram is said to be the most authentic treatise on the principles of Aghor. During his tour Keenaram first stopped at the dwelling of \\"Grihast Saint\\", Shiva Das for few days. Shiva Das observed Kinarm activities very minutely and was impressed by the extraordinary qualities, suspecting that he is an Avatar or a reincarnation. One day while on way to bath in river Ganges, Shiva Das handed over his entire belongings to the boy Keenaram and hid himself in nearby bushes. He observed that the river Ganges become very restless as the boy approached closer. The level of water started to rise, and suddenly settled down only after touching the feet of Keenaram. Keenaram was known as the biggest saint of the Era of Aghor tradition also known as Lord Shiva tradition. Baba Keenaram Sthal Keenaram was the first Founder/Peethadheswar of Baba Keenaram Sthal(headquarter / Pilgrim of Aghors sect., across world) and lived for 170 years. Before he took Samadhi (where his body is buried in a tomb, along with Goddess Hinglaj in Yantra (A Mystical geometrical shape to represent the presence of goddess)'s form, at Baba Keenaram Sthal Legacy His birth anniversary is celebrated annually in Chandauli district. In 2019, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh had attended the ceremony and announced that his birthplace would be developed by the UP government as a tourist place.

Raymond Brown. The film is based on Brown's 2003 book, Will The Real Pimps and Hos Please Stand Up! ‚Äî Peeping the Multi-leveled Global Game. The book and the film examine the interplay between Pimps and \\"Hos\\" and how that dynamic is the oldest and simplest expression of the ways in which power is wielded in today's world. The film uses documentary footage, animation, satire and dramatization to illustrate examples culled from the \\"hood\\" to Wall Street. Whether the players are real-life pimps or corporate executives, they are all playing the ‚Äúgame‚Äù and repeating the same power dynamics. There have historically been many negative associations with the provocative language and images surrounding the sexual politics of the Pimp/Ho dynamic. GhettoPhysics looks closely at this reality, then goes beyond the world of prostitution to illustrate and clarify how the game is played. Weaving together theories of metaphysics and archetypal psychology, the film explains how the GhettoPhysics game crosses all races, all classes and all socio-economic levels. There are elements of the Pimp and elements of the Ho in everyone, whether they are male or female, black or white, rich or poor. The idea is to become aware of how the game is being played so one may take responsibility and gain more control over one's own life. On the decision to utilize the Pimp/Ho metaphor for the film, Arntz and Brown explain, \\"We don‚Äôt normally refer to power interactions in say, politics or economics as a game. But this is exactly what is taking place. GhettoPhysics helps you become more aware of it and play it from a position of personal power.\\" Synopsis The basic tenet of GhettoPhysics is that the Pimp/Ho game is the fundamental expression of how people interact in the world. But this interaction is so multilayered and can become so complex that it is hard to see the game. However, by looking at the world using the Pimp/Ho dynamic, it becomes very easy to see the manipulations that keep society's Hos forever in debt, disempowered or marching off to war, while society‚Äôs Pimps remain rich, powerful, and in control. The film includes interviews with notable entertainers and thinkers such as Dr. Cornel West, Ice-T, Norman Lear, Cynthia McKinney, KRS-One, John Perkins (author), Byron Katie, Too Short, and William Arntz. It also includes a colorful contingent of street characters, with names such as Fillmore Slim, Candy, Hook da Crook, Loreal, Mac Breed and Lo Da Show. The Pimp/Ho dynamic is not limited to the streets of the inner city ghettos, but extends throughout all aspects of today‚Äôs society from government to business, religion and education. Analyzing real world issues such as the global economic crisis, the Gulf oil spill, global ecological threats, healthcare reform and war, GhettoPhysics details the street world and then moves to the classroom and the corporate boardroom to illustrate how the game is being played every day.

Jack FM has its studios at Midwest Communications' facilities at 1420 Bellevue St in the Green Bay suburb of Bellevue, Wisconsin, adjacent to the tower site of sister station WNFL. History The station that would eventually become WYDR was launched by Midwest Communications in 1971 under the call sign of WROE with a beautiful music format, a format found quite frequently on FM radio in that era. In 1977, Midwest bought WBAY-AM and WBAY-FM (the current WTAQ and WIXX, respectively), forcing the company to sell WROE due to FCC regulations limiting station ownership at the time. WROE received consistently high audience rating numbers through the 1980s, as \\"Easy 94.3\\", or simply, \\"Roe\\". After a long run with beautiful music, WROE changed to a soft AC format in January 1990, using the advertising tagline \\"Soft Favorites\\". In 1997, Midwest repurchased WROE and sister stations WNCY-FM and WNFL after 1996 loosening of radio ownership rules permitted them to do so. From 1998 to 2001, WROE simulcast on sister station WLTM, with the stations branded as \\"The Lite FM, 94.3 and 99.7.\\" During this time, WROE and WLTM would add Delilah's nationally syndicated program (though it would eventually drop it later in the 2000s). When WLTM dropped away from the simulcast in March 2001 and launched its own format, WROE reverted to using its call sign for on-air branding. In March 2006, WROE made a shift toward an adult hits format, branded as \\"94.3 The Bridge.\\" On November 14, 2008, the station dropped \\"The Bridge\\" and reverted to its WROE branding and Soft AC format. In August 2009, the station rejoined in a simulcast with 99.7 FM and its Green Bay translator at 101.9 FM, which dropped its own adult hits format. WROE and WRQE would eventually add the John Tesh nightly radio program after the show's former home in the Fox Cities, WECB, changed formats at the end of 2009. WYDR's former logo (with WZDR simulcast) as \\"The Drive\\" At 5PM on September 3, 2010, Midwest Communications dropped the Soft AC format a second time, and with it WROE's longtime call sign. The stations became WYDR (94.3) and WZDR (99.7/101.9) and adopted a classic hits/classic rock hybrid format as \\"The Drive,\\" a format similar to that of WDRV in Chicago and sister station WOZZ, which adopted a more mainstream rock format at the same time and date as \\"The Drive's\\" debut (and using 99.7's former WRQE call sign). On March 16, 2015, WZDR split off from its simulcast with WYDR, changing its call sign to WDKF. WDKF now simulcasts with sister station WGEE (93.5 Duke FM). On October 23, 2015, WYDR dropped the \\"Drive\\" format after five years and rebranded as a Jack FM affiliate. This is the second time that the station has adopted an Adult Hits format (since \\"The Bridge\\" in 2006). While WYDR pays to license the Jack FM name, the station is locally programmed and is not part of the syndicated format that is delivered via satellite.

Originally making a Jeep lookalike called the RV, between 1981 and 1998 they built several iterations of a gull-winged car called the Eagle SS. The SS was based on an American kit car called the Cimbria (itself based on the earlier Sterling, which in turn was a copy of the British Nova), and was brought to the UK by Tim Dutton (of Dutton Cars). In 1988 Eagle Cars moved inland, to nearby Storrington. Company history Founded by Allen Breeze, the company was sold to trials motorcyclist Rob Budd in 1989. Eagle Cars Limited changed location again in the nineties, moving to Walberton (still in West Sussex). The company officially ceased trading in 1998, but production had ended long before. The moulds and rights to Eagle's various cars are currently in the hands of a variety of other companies. The SS moulds were sold by Tim Naylor of TEAC Sports Cars in 2012 on eBay to a buyer from Wexford, and nothing more has been heard of them since. TEAC has ceased to exist and all trace of the SS moulds have disappeared. The RV moulds were apparently seized by bailiffs and have also vanished. All attempts to trace the whereabouts of the various Eagle moulds have drawn a blank as of November 2012. Anyone knowing where they are should contact the Eagle Owners Club. Eagle SS Late version with different headlights As with so many of its kit car brethren, the dramatic bodywork of the Eagle SS hid humble VW Beetle underpinnings. The bodywork was from glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP), molded in a single colour. The total weight of a finished SS was promised to be around , which meant performance was considerably improved over that of a standard Beetle. A top speed of with a tuned VW engine was also promised. The most obvious difference to the Cimbria, upon which the Eagle SS was based, was the Cimbria's flip-up headlights: Eagle chose to equip their version with round, rear-folding headlights in the style of the Porsche 928. Three basic versions were produced: * The MkI has a separate internal roll cage, long nose, windows hinged at the front edge. Both bonnet and boot lids had ribbed sections, boot lid ribs could be opened up as louvers for better air flow for the VW engine if desired. * The MkII went through the most changes, receiving a shorter removable nose section, built-in roll cage on later models, longer side windows hinged from front bottom and top corners, and the addition of a Ford-based model. Ford versions have a bump on the bonnet to accommodate the engine and later version had smooth boot lids with the ribs removed. * The MkIII reverted to a one piece nose, received a slightly higher roof, and both versions now had built-in steel bars to protect the cabin area. Side windows as per the MkII. The chassis was an unshortened Volkswagen Type 1 platform with a wheelbase, while the car was long, wide, and a mere high. First mentioned in 1984, a targa-roofed 2+2-seater version called the 2 Plus was also available, with only a slight weight penalty. (Swedish issue of German Auto Katalog) =Front-engined version= Late Eagle SS, rear view Later, Eagle engineered a front-engined, tubular framed chassis for the SS. This used Ford Cortina running gear, and was easily recognized by its conspicuous (and odd-looking) bonnet bulge. Eagle also claimed it possible, and indeed it has been done, to fit this version of the SS with Rover's familiar 3.5-litre V8. At least one car was built on the Ford Sierra 4x4 running gear but sadly the EOC has been informed it suffered in a roof collapse and is no longer a viable repair. The Series 3 SS was somewhat taller, at . In 2005 the rights (and the dormant moulds) to the Eagle SS were rescued from a Kent boat yard by Tim Naylor of TEAC Sports Cars. Unfortunately, Tim was unable to raise sufficient interest in the revised mid- engine MkIV SS based on a Toyota MR2 donor which was exhibited at Stoneleigh in 2006, and the project has since been sold on eBay in 2010 to a buyer in Wexford. Approximately only 340 of each version (VW and Ford) covering all three marks were made, a total of 680+ cars, of which 180 are accounted for on the E.O.C. register, http://www.eagleownersclub.org.uk/Eagle%20register%20for%20web.htm and under a handful are currently on the road (DVLA January 2014). Other models Eagle Cars' fibreglass-bodied Jeep-lookalike, the Jeep RV,Salon 89/90, p. 170 was built around Ford Cortina parts. There was also an Eagle RV 4X4 (Range Rover, later also Daihatsu Fourtrak/Rocky based), unusual for kit cars in that it had four-wheel drive. The RV used an X-braced ladder frame and the expected Ford engines, although the Ford Capri's 3-litre V6 and the usual Rover V8 were also possible fitments, while the Eagle 4x4 was available with a whole host of different engines from Rover, Mercedes, Peugeot, or Ford.Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1990, p. 1237 Later a Ford Sierra-based two-seater, two-door convertible (also available with a hardtop) called the Milan 2 Plus. This was first seen in 1988 and was co-developed with \\"Milan-Automobile\\" of Remscheid, Germany. Since it accepted all Sierra underpinnings, the Milan was available with engines ranging from 1.6 to 2.8 litres and with either rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.BilKatalogen 1989, p. 118 During the eighties, an RV Jeep Series II was developed, using more modern Ford Sierra parts. Eagle also offered modified versions of the sporting 2-seater Dutton Phaeton using Ford Escort Mk I and Mk II parts, called the Eagle P21 and P25. These could accept a multitude of engines, ranging from the donor Escort's four-cylinder to a Rover V8. They were long, wide and tall.

Launched in 2007 by the joint effort of the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages and the National Geographic Society, it has organized expeditions to language \\"hotspots\\" around the world, e.g. to Australia, Bolivia, East India. Enduring Voices tries to understand the geographic dimensions of language distribution, determine how linguistic diversity is linked to biodiversity and bring wider attention to the issue of language loss. The Enduring Voices Project assists indigenous communities in their efforts to revitalize and maintain their threatened languages. The Language Hotspots model for prioritizing language research was conceived and developed by Dr. Greg Anderson and K. David Harrison at the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages to identify most endangered and least studied languages. It is a new way to view the distribution of global linguistic diversity, to assess the threat of language extinction, and to. Hotspots are those regions of the world having the greatest linguistic diversity, the greatest language endangerment, and the least-studied languages. For the project, Doctors Anderson and Harrison are accompanied by Chris Rainier,Chris Rainier website about his involvement with National Geographic Enduring Voices Project a National Geographic Fellow and ethnographic photographer and filmmaker for helping in documenting various linguistic expedition on camera and film. Identified hotspots with degrees of threat of language extinction include: *Severe: North West Pacific Plateau (USA), Central South America, Central Siberia, Eastern Siberia and Northern Australia *High: Oklahoma Southwest, Southern South America, *Medium: Northern South America, Western Melanesia *Low: MesoAmerica, Western Africa, Eastern Africa, Southern Africa, Caucasus, Eastern India and Malaysia, SouthEast Asia, Eastern Melanesia and Taiwan-Philippines.

Elements of Interior Decoration The settlement existed in Getic times (4th century BC). Its growing importance as a centre of commerce led to the construction of the fortified town during the reign of the Tetrarchy and Constantine the Great. It was tentatively identified by V. P√¢rvan as polis Ibida, a town briefly mentioned by Procopius as one of those repaired by Justinian (De aed. IV,7). A. Aricescu identified it as Libida, based on a short passage from Theophylactus Simocatta. The town and area around was abandoned in the 7th cent. AD after the Bulgar invasions. Archeological history In 1875 an inscription found on the site was published. In 1885 Dimitrie C. Butculescu executed a first archeologic sondage. Requested by Grigore Tocilescu, the town was described by topograph Pamfil Polonic in 1897, who identified 33 towers and 3 gates, but there was not publication. In 1908 Raymund Netzhammer published a description of the town similar to the 1897 version. Vasile P√¢rvan identified the settlement in 1911 as Ibida. Constantin Moisil names the town in 1916 when a treasure of drachmes was found. In 1917 the Bulgar lieutenant Iconomof performed excavations and found the remains of a Basilica with 3 naves. In 1926, George G. Mateescu performed new excavations with unpublished results. Research in 1953 by a team exploring Histria, north and west of the town, of led to the discovery of Getic and Roman-Byzantine bricks and pottery and bronze coins from the Justinian I era. In 1977 Al. S. Stefan with a photogrammetry process restored the plan of the archaeological area. In 1988 A.

The brief reference to the situation in the Darfur region divided Council members, with Algeria, China and Pakistan against a mention of Darfur and the other two-thirds of the Council supporting its inclusion. The Security Council praised the work of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and others for their role in the peace process. It urged the parties involved to speedily conclude a peace agreement, and condemned all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and acts of violence. There was concern at the humanitarian impact of the situation on the civilian population of Sudan. The resolution created an advance team, under the leadership of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, for an initial period of three months to facilitate contacts between the parties and provide support after the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. At the same time, the Council intended to establish a support operation to facilitate the implementation of the peace agreement, and requested the Secretary-General Kofi Annan to submit recommendations on its composition and mandate and to prepare for its deployment. The Council also emphasised the importance of an effective public information capacity through radio, television and newspapers in order to promote the peace process and the role of the United Nations.

Penot studied in Basel. Penot came under the influence of Paracelsus through Adam von Bodenstein.Schmieder, Geschichte der Alchemie, 297. He supposedly squandered his entire fortune on his alchemical studies, while searching for the Philosopher's Stone. In the end, he distanced himself from alchemy, which he had previously defended in writing.Schmieder, loc. cit. Penot occasionally served as doctor in Frankenthal (Pfalz). He travelled a great deal and had a wide network of contacts and correspondents in England, Bohemia and Switzerland, and including Jacob Zwinger and Andreas Libavius. He died impoverished at the hospital in Yverdon-les-Bains (Ifferten), where he had been the city doctor from 1596.

This crossing of the Bow River was traditionally a bison-hunting and gathering place for the Siksika people and their allies in the Blackfoot Confederacy. Nearby are the remains of an ancient earthlodge village, believed to have been built by people from the Upper Mississippi valley in what is now the United States. It is unique in being an example of a permanent village on the plains: an area associated with nomadic hunting. The crossing became an important place in Canadian history when Treaty 7 was signed here between the native nations of what is now southern Alberta and the Canadian government on behalf of the Crown in 1877. It was also here that Crowfoot, chief of the Siksika, is believed to have died and been buried. As well, Poundmaker, a Cree chief who had been ceremonially adopted by Crowfoot in order to create peace between the Blackfoot and the Cree, was also buried here until being moved in 1967. In 1925 the traditional gathering site and the treaty signing site were declared National Historic Sites of Canada by the federal government's Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.Canada's Historic Places - Treaty N¬∫ 7 Signing Site National Historic Site of Canada Retrieved October 6, 2010 In 1972, the earthlodge village was also declared a national historic site.Parks Canada - Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada - Earthlodge Village National Historic Site of Canada Retrieved October 6, 2010 In 1977, Prince Charles visited the site to help commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the treaty. After the success of this event the Siksika council wanted to build the site into a historical and tourist attraction and began fundraising and planning. In 2007 the historical park opened, which includes an interpretive centre, monuments to Poundmaker, Crowfoot, and Treaty 7, tipi remains, and hiking trails, and the earthlodge village site. The earthlodge village is the only known one of its type on the Canadian Prairies, though they are common in parts of the United States. The creators of the earthlodge village are not known with certainty, but archaeological evidence points to it being founded around 1740 CE, possibly by a band of migrating Mandan people or their allies the Hidatsa (possibly before the Hidatsa and Crow people split). The nearest towns are Cluny and Gleichen, in Wheatland County.

Loughran, S.J., Ph.D. (March 22, 1940 - December 24, 2006) was an American Jesuit who served as the 12th president of Loyola Marymount University and 21st president of Saint Peter's College. Biography =Early life= Loughran was born in Brooklyn, New York on March 22, 1940. He graduated from Brooklyn Prep in 1957 and entered the Society of Jesus in July 1958. Loughran attended the College of the Holy Cross and graduated from Fordham University, earning a Bachelor's degree in History, summa cum laude, in 1964. He also earned a Master's degree and a Doctorate in Philosophy from Fordham University and studied Theology in France and at Woodstock College in New York. He was ordained on June 11, 1970 and took his final vows on December 8, 1978. =Academic career= While president of LMU, Loughran directed considerable financial resources to academics and lowered the minimum course load for professors from four to three, freeing up faculty for research and other scholarly and creative pursuits. He established classes in the study of American cultures, in part to raise awareness of the school's minority students who were pushing for greater recognition. He was president in 1990 when one of Loyola Marymount's top basketball players, Hank Gathers, collapsed during a game and died. Gathers' family brought a wrongful-death suit against Loyola Marymount that the school settled for $545,000. Loughran raised the university's endowment from about $21 million to $106 million before he resigned unexpectedly in 1991. In February 1990, Loughran denied university recognition to a fledgling gay and lesbian student organization, the Alliance of Gays and Lesbians - Loyola Marymount University (AGL-LMU), despite the group's support from both the student and faculty senates and in disregard of the fact that its charter did not violate Catholic teachings. At the time of Loughran's decision, there was already a formally recognized gay and lesbian student group at Loyola Law School, which is part of Loyola Marymount University, though on a separate campus. Loughran's actions set off a contentious debate among students, faculty and staff. The organization struggled after its founding president graduated, though it survives in some form as of 2011. In addition to his leadership positions at LMU and St Peter's, Loughran served as acting president of Brooklyn College in 1992, interim president of Mount St. Mary's College in Emmittsburg, Maryland, from 1993‚Äì94 and dean of Fordham College in New York. Fr. Loughran was an Associate Professor of Philosophy at Fordham from 1974‚Äì1984 and held the Edmund Miller, S.J., Philosophy Professorship at John Carroll University in Cleveland, Ohio from 1992-1993. Prior to returning to Saint Peter's as President, Loughran was Interim Vice President for Academic Affairs and Interim Dean of the Arts and Sciences faculty at Fordham.

He is best known for his books on modern art, including Clement Greenberg: The Collected Essays and Criticism, one of The New York Times ‚ÄúNotable Books of the Year‚Äù in 1986, and for his exhibitions on nuclear photography such as Camera Atomica, organized for the Art Gallery of Ontario in 2015. Camera Atomica was the first comprehensive exhibition on postwar nuclear photography. From 1987-2017 he taught at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, where he held the Brenda & David McLean Chair in Canadian Studies (2008-11) and was an Associate of the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies. O‚ÄôBrian has been a critic of neoconservative policies since the start of the Culture Wars in the 1980s. He is a recipient of the Thakore Award in Human Rights and Peace Studies from Simon Fraser University. Early life and education O'Brian was born in 1944 to Canadian parents in Bath, England. His father was a career officer in the Royal Air Force. His only sibling, Peter, is a filmmaker and producer. In 1969 he married Helen Worts, with whom he has three children: Melanie O‚ÄôBrian, Amy O‚ÄôBrian Wang, and Meghan O‚ÄôBrian Braunstein. He also has four grandchildren. He was educated at New Park School in St. Andrews, Fife, and Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario, before entering Trinity College at the University of Toronto, where he received an Honours B.A. in Political Science and Economics in 1966. At university, he played Varsity rugby. He worked at the Toronto firm of Harris & Partners until 1974, before enrolling at York University to study art and literature. There, he began to publish art criticism, poetry, and art history. He received his PhD in art history from Harvard University under the supervision of T.J. Clark.Elizabeth Lumley, Canadian Who's Who (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2007), 983. While at Harvard, he was a Research Associate at the Fogg Art Museum and a proponent of ‚Äúsocial art history,‚Äù an approach that investigates social as well as aesthetic issues. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested in how art gets produced and looked at under the social arrangements of capitalism,‚Äù he stated in an interview. His work has sometimes been targeted by neoconservative critics for mixing art and politics.For example, the audience response to John O‚ÄôBrian, ‚ÄúClement Greenberg Reconsidered,‚Äù lecture at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (May 2, 1995). O‚ÄôBrian was also a member of the Pumping Station collective, a group of radical thinkers that met at the house of Gillian and Iain Boal, during the first half of the 1980s. Teaching and Lectures O‚ÄôBrian has taught at York University, Toronto, Harvard University, Cambridge, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, and Ritsumeikan University, Kyoto. At the University of British Columbia, he was appointed Assistant Professor in 1987, Associate Professor in 1991, and Full Professor in 1998. He chaired the University Art Committee from 1993-2014 and the Program in Canadian Studies from 2002-05. He also held the Brenda & David McLean Chair in Canadian Studies from 2008-11 and was an Associate of the Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies. He taught undergraduate and graduate courses, in addition to supervising MA and Ph.D. theses. He also organized numerous field trips for students. Following the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States in 2016, he canceled a field trip to New York because, he said, ‚Äúworms are crawling out of the ground all over America [and I will] not crawl with them.‚ÄùJohn O‚ÄôBrian, ‚ÄúLetter to Graduate Students,‚Äù December 15, 2016. Students circulated a petition denouncing the cancellation. He has lectured across North America as well as in Europe, Australia, China, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Palestine, and South Africa. He was the Shastri Indo-Canadian Institute Visiting Lecturer in India in 1996-97 and Visiting Research Professor at Ritsumeikan University in Japan in 2007.  Museums and Galleries  O'Brian has been professionally involved with museums and galleries as a curator, exhibitor, researcher, advisor, and board member. From 1989-1991, he was a member of the board of the Vancouver Art Gallery, and from 1991-98 a Special Advisor to the board of the National Gallery of Canada, In 2020 was appointed an External Advisor to the National Gallery. He has also been involved with the Harvard University Art Museum, Polygon Gallery, and the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery. He maintains an occasional art practice. His work has been exhibited at public and private galleries: Octozilla (2018), produced with Gregory Coyes, was shown at the Vancouver Art Gallery; Ci elegans (2017), produced with Marina Roy, at SFU Galleries, Vancouver; Sixteen Nuclear Power Stations (2013) at the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto; Multiplication (1998) at the Catriona Jeffries Gallery, Vancouver; and More Los Angeles Apartments (1998) at Gagosian Gallery in New York and Los Angeles. ‚ÄúMore Los Angeles Apartments unfolds as a peripatetic meditation on Edward Ruscha‚Äôs photobooks, personally placing O‚ÄôBrian in geographical and conceptual proximity to Ruscha‚Äôs earlier work.‚Äù Publications O'Brian is the author or editor of twenty books and many articles. Some have been translated into French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, or Japanese. Approximately half his publications focus on Canadian art and culture. His first book, David Milne and the Modern Tradition of Painting, published in 1983, is the first in-depth study of the artist. His most recent book, The Bomb in the Wilderness: Photography and the Nuclear Era in Canada, published in 2020, is the first substantial examination on what photography reveals about the size and shape of Canada‚Äôs nuclear footprint. = The Bomb in the Wilderness: Photography and the Nuclear Era in Canada = The Bomb in the Wilderness contends that photography is one of the primary ways, if not the primary way, nuclear activities are interpreted and remembered. The book asks: Do photographs alert viewers to nuclear threat, numb them to its dangers, or do both at the same time? O‚ÄôBrian argues that the impact and global reach of Canada‚Äôs nuclear programs have been felt ever since the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The book has been referred to as a ‚Äúfoundational text.‚ÄùClaude Baillargeon, The Bomb in the Wilderness, cover. Douglas Coupland writes, ‚ÄúIt finds beauty in grotesque places [and] validates the reader‚Äôs Cold War paranoia.‚ÄùDouglas Coupland, The Bomb in the Wilderness, cover. = Camera Atomica = Guest curated by O'Brian for the Art Gallery of Ontario in 2015, Camera Atomica was \\"the first substantial exhibition of nuclear photography to encompass the entire postwar period from the bombings of Hiroshima in 1945 to the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in 2011.\\"\\"Camera Atomica,\\" Art Gallery of Ontario The exhibition included over 200 works ranging from photographs taken by the United States government of atomic bomb tests to images of anti-nuclear protests on the streets of Toronto, to images by artists, to photos of the utilization of nuclear technology in medicine. In addition to addressing key issues in the nuclear era, Camera Atomica aimed to make visible the interconnections between nuclear technology and the photographic medium. One critic concluded that going to the show was ‚Äúa civic duty.‚Äù Peter Galison wrote that \\"this remarkable show and catalogue promise to make clear that the age of the nucleus is also and always an age of the image.\\"[Peter Galison, http://artforum.com/museums/id=5164, May 2015] = Ruthless Hedonism: The American Reception of Matisse = Matisse was an emblematic figure in twentieth-century art, perhaps the emblem of an artist whose work is predicated on the sensual pleasures of looking. This study investigates how the artist and his work were received in America until his death in 1954. To promote his work, Matisse tried to show the media that whatever his reputation as an avant-gardist the conduct of his life was solidly bourgeois. He collaborated closely with museums exhibiting his work, cultivated private collectors, and played off dealers against each other. The book ‚Äúcasts a great deal of light on the way in which a picture becomes valuable‚Ä¶ Patronage is as much a romance as a business transaction.‚Äù = Clement Greenberg: The Collected Essays and Criticism = The four volumes of Clement Greenberg: The Collected Essays and Criticism have generated international interest and debate. The first two volumes appeared in 1986, the second two in 1993. In an editorial written for The New Criterion, Hilton Kramer expressed admiration for Greenberg's criticism but distaste for O'Brian's politicization of it. Following a 2009 symposium at Harvard University on Greenberg, Jeff Nguyen wrote: > ‚ÄúThe symposium kicked off with a roundtable discussion featuring experts on > Greenberg‚Äôs art criticism: Yve-Alain Bois (heavyweight in 20th century > European and American art), Thierry de Duve (specialist in the metaphysics > of art, made Duchamp difficult), Serge Guilbaut (specialist in art and > politics during the Cold War), Rosalind Krauss (foremost champion of > Greenberg, turned defector), John O‚ÄôBrian (editor of the Collected Essays > and Criticism). Benjamin Buchloch was the moderator. Holy Critics! How many > more rock stars can you cram into a room? The only person missing from this > esteemed company was Michael Fried. The University of British Columbia > (Serge Guilbaut and John O‚ÄôBrian) appears to be a happening place for art > history.‚Äù Research and Archives Until the early 2000s, O‚ÄôBrian‚Äôs research focused on modern art history and criticism, primarily in North America. Since then, it has concentrated on nuclear photography in North America and Japan. His archives include photographs, study notes, correspondence, interviews, journal reviews, and press clippings. Notable collections within the archives include correspondence with Clement Greenberg from 1981-1993 and atomic photographs (military, press, and vernacular), artworks, protest leaflets, propaganda pamphlets, corporate reports, government bulletins, newspaper front pages, and postcards. The archives are promised to the National Gallery of Canada.

Conceived by James (Jim) Tuck while working at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), he whimsically named the device on the chance that it might be able to create fusion reactions.Brown, Laurie M.; Pais, Abraham; and Pippard, A. B. \\"Twentieth century physics\\", p. 1636, CRC Press, . Accessed October 8, 2010. The first example was built in the winter of 1952/53, and it quickly demonstrated a series of instabilities in the plasma that plagued the pinch concept. A series of modifications followed which attempted to correct these problems, leading to the ultimate \\"S-4\\" model. None of these proved fruitful. History =Early fusion efforts= Scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory had a long history of studying nuclear fusion, and by 1946 they had calculated that a steady-state plasma would have to be heated to 100 million degrees Celsius (180 million degrees Fahrenheit) to \\"ignite\\" and release net energy.Phillips, pg. 64 This was of vital interest in the nuclear bomb establishment, where the use of a small atomic bomb \\"trigger\\" was used to provide the required temperatures. Capturing that energy on a smaller industrial scale would not be easy, since plasma at that temperature would melt any physical container. As plasma is electrically conductive it was obvious that it could be contained magnetically, but the proper arrangement of the fields was not obvious. Enrico Fermi pointed out that a simple toroid would cause the fuel to drift out of the \\"bottle\\".Phillips, pg. 65 Several arrangements were studied, notably the stellarator developed around 1950. =Z-pinch= The Lorenz force created by a lightning strike crushed this hollow lightning rod and led to the discovery of the pinch technique. An alternate approach was the \\"pinch\\" concept, developed in the United Kingdom. Unlike the magnetic bottle approaches, in a pinch device, the required magnetic field was created by the plasma itself. Since the plasma is electrically conductive, if one were to run a current through the plasma, it would create an induced magnetic field. This field, through the Lorentz force, will act to compress the conductor. In the case of a plasma, the force would collapse it into a thin filament, \\"pinching\\" it. Since the current had to be very large, pinch devices made no attempt to confine the plasmas for extended periods. They would attempt to reach fusion conditions quickly and then extract power from the resulting hot products. The pinch technique was patented in 1946 by George Paget Thomson and Moses Blackman, who explored both linear and toroidal pinch machines. Jim Tuck was first introduced to these concepts in January 1947, in a meeting arranged at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell.Herman, pg. 40Bromberg, pg. 20 Tuck studied the Thomson-Blackman work and concluded that they would not reach fusion condition, but would nevertheless be interesting as an experimental system. Working at the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University, he arranged funding for an experimental device and started assembling it. Before it was complete, he was lured to the US by a job offer at the University of Chicago (Illinois). Other teams in the UK continued their efforts. Thomson passed his concepts on to Stan Cousins and Alan Ware, who assembled a linear pinch device using old radar equipment, and started operations in 1947. Follow-on experiments used large banks of capacitors to store energy that was quickly dumped into the plasma through a solenoid wrapped around a short tube. These experiments demonstrated a number of dynamic instabilities that caused the plasma to break up and hit the walls of the tube long before it was compressed or heated enough to reach the required fusion conditions. After a short time in Chicago, Tuck was hired by Los Alamos to work on the \\"Super\\" project (the hydrogen bomb), where he was put on the task of calculating the nuclear cross section of the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction. This work continued to pique his interest in fusion power, and he spent some time through 1951 considering the problem.Bromberg, pg. 25 At Los Alamos, Tuck acquainted the US researchers with the British efforts. By this point Lyman Spitzer had introduced his stellarator concept and was talking the idea around the energy establishment, seeking funding. In 1951 he approached the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to fund his design. Tuck was skeptical of Spitzer's enthusiasm and felt his aggressive development program was \\"incredibly ambitious\\".Bromberg, pg. 21 Tuck proposed a much less-aggressive program based on pinch. Both men presented their ideas in Washington, D.C. in May 1951. In July, Spitzer received $50,000, and Tuck was sent away without funding. Not to be outdone, Tuck convinced Norris Bradbury, the Los Alamos director, to give him $50,000 from the discretionary budget, using it to build the Perhapsatron. Still unconvinced that the concept would work on the first attempt, he called this approach, with Stanislaw Ulam's input, the Perhapsatron.Herman, pg. 41 Tuck assembled a small team, and using scrounged parts, built the first Perhapsatron in 1952/53. The Perhapsatron used a toroidal tube made in the local glass shop. In the middle of the toroid was a large iron core from a transformer, which was used to induce current into the gas. The Perhapsatron quickly displayed the same problems as the British experiments. No matter how slowly the current was added, once it reached a critical point the instabilities arose. In 1954, Martin David Kruskal and Martin Schwarzschild published a critical paper on the issue, which suggested that all Z-pinch devices were inherently unstable. Tuck proposed the addition of a second, steady, magnetic field running longitudinal along the tube, a concept he called \\"adding a backbone to the plasma\\". Several modifications to the Perhapsatron were made to test variations on these concepts, but none proved fruitful.Phillips, pg. 66 =Z-pinch goes out of favor= The failure of Perhapsatron was followed by the failure of other pinch devices. Another team at Los Alamos had been working on another fast-pinch machine known as Columbus that used electrical fields instead of magnetic, producing the same results. Meanwhile the much larger ZETA machine in the UK also failed, after publishing results with great fanfare saying they had successfully achieved fusion. By 1961 work on Z-pinch devices had largely ended, although some research continued on the related theta-pinch concept. Tuck never restricted himself to the pinch concept, and he spent considerable effort on other concepts, which led to joking within Los Alamos about his apparently unfocused work.Bromberg, pg. 58 Over the years he led development of several other concepts, including the picket-fence reactor, new pinch concepts, and work on mainstream devices.

Rock veneers are typically one or two clasts thick and may partially or fully cover the ground surface.Osterkamp, W.R., 2008, Annotated Definitions of Selected Geomorphic Terms and Related Terms of Hydrology, Sedimentology, Soil Science and Ecology. U.S Department of the Interior U.S Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia, Open File Report 2008-1217, p. 49 Veneers typically form in semiarid and arid regions where chemical weathering rates and the potential for mass wasting are low. Other names for a rock veneer are rock-fragment cover (RFC), stone pavement, desert pavement, stony mantle, hammada and reg. Formation Rock veneers commonly arise from the weathering of resistant rocks of quartzite, felsic granites, coarse granites, and dense basalts. As these larger rocks are deposited on a surface, smaller sands either are removed by wind or water erosion, or settle and form a fine-grained layer beneath the larger veneer rocks. The larger clasts then rearrange and settle to form the rock veneer.Lenart, M.T., Osterkamp, W.R., and Toy, T.J., \\"Development of partial rock veneers by root throw in a subalpine setting\\". Wiley InterScience, Sept 27, 2005. Rock veneers form a variety of ways, with two major types; in situ veneers form in place by means of weathering, fluvial erosion, deflation (the removal of loose, fine-grained particles) or accretion; other veneers are transported via soil creep, sheet flooding or gully gravure (described below).Toy, Terrence, and Osterkamp, W.R., \\"The Stability of Rock-Veneered Hillslopes.\\" International Journal of Sediment Research, Vol 14, No 3, 1999, pp. 63-73. Rock veneers are typically distinguished through six variables: particle size, particle density, stability characteristics, potential for storing mobile sediments, degree of abrasion, and varnishing.Jones, D.K.C., Cooke, R.U., and Warren, A., 1986. \\"Geomorphological investigation, for engineering purposes of blowing sand and dust hazard\\". Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geology, Vol 19, pp. 251-270. =Gully Gravure= Gully gravure is a transportation process by which rock veneers can be formed. Valleys formed of gullies and rills are made and coarse rock fragments are deposited in side channels. As the side channels fill in, water forms new, less resistant channels down the borders of the coarse channels and finer gullies and rills. These channels build up, and the process happens again, resulting in a reversal of rills and gullies, with coarser clasts on the surface. =Root Throw= Root throw is the process that occurs when a tree topples, raising its rootwad and the rock fragments in it. Fine sediment falls back into the rootwad pit or travels downstream, but coarse sediments form a local rock veneer around the rootwad. This local rock veneer is larger than the pit of the rootwad, as falling clasts extend the area of veneer. In a study of rootwads in Westcliffe, Colorado, it was estimated that root throw could have created a rock veneer over 90% of the surface during the Holocene. Root throw produces a rock veneer when there are a large number of clasts near the surface, where there are: a slow rate of chemical weathering, insufficient precipitation to move the large clasts, high velocity winds, conditions favorable to shallow-rooted trees, and trees large enough to embed coarse rock in their roots. Effects Hillslopes with a rock veneer are more stable than those without and have lower erosion rates. Rock veneers form a rocky armor on the hillslope which prevents the erosion of smaller sediments and stabilizes the slope. Rock veneers, forming when influx and outflux sediment rates are equal, indicate a hillslope in equilibrium, partly due to their protective cover on the slope. Erosion rates on veneered hillslopes are low to moderate.

It completed filming in September 2010. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2011.2011 Sundance Film Festival Noncompetitive Categories Standard Examiner. 2 December 2011 The film was critically panned. Plot Friends Ron, Jonathan, Richard and Tim, have known each other since college. They reunite in Big Sur to celebrate Tim's 44th birthday. Each of them enjoy some degree of professional success but are unfulfilled with their lives. Ron is a stockbroker, but is currently facing indictment from the SEC for embezzlement. Jonathan runs a medical practice, but all of his patients are wealthy drug addicts, he and his wife are divorced, and their young son identifies more with the stepfather. Richard is a published author, but has only written one book and now teaches high school English. Tim, openly bisexual, was in a happy relationship with a man, until accidentally causing fatal car crash five years ago that took the lives of his boyfriend and his sister. The four friends party for several days at a beach side mansion, during which the men consume massive quantities of drugs provided by Jonathan, including prescription opioids and marijuana. They head into town for food and to pick up women, where Richard convinces a young waitress to bring her friends back to the house. Tim engages in a three-way with two of the revelers, during which they role play the parts of Tim's dead boyfriend and sister. The next morning, Tim hangs himself. The three friends find him, along with a suicide note reminding them of a suicide pact they made in 1986--promising that they would kill themselves together if they found life unfulfilling in middle age. Afraid that the police will blame them for Tim's death, they bury him on the beach behind the house. Ron does not believe they should fulfill the suicide pact, which results in Richard and Jonathan mocking him as a coward and a liar. Ron goes to the airport to return home, but cannot bring himself to board the plane after listening to worrisome voicemails from his wife, indicating that federal agents are waiting to arrest him. He rejoins Richard and Jonathan at the mansion. The men eat lunch at a restaurant where an elderly man goes into cardiac arrest. Jonathan saves his life, drawing the attention of police Officer Boyde. Coming to the house to thank Jonathan, Boyde encounters an inebriated and agitated Ron. Believing that Boyde knows something is wrong, Ron attempts to get her to leave, raising Boyde's suspicions. Richard finds Ron in his room, unwilling to return home to the waiting federal agents. He tells Richard that he is frustrated with where his life has ended up, cannot face his wife and family, and no longer wants to live. Richard agrees to help him end his suffering and smothers him with a pillow. The next morning, Richard and Jonathan bury Ron beside Tim. Richard and Jonathan go into town to party, where Richard provokes two young men into beating him up. Jonathan, having decided to end his life, calls his son, asking the boy to promise him to remember who his real father was. After Jonathan's ex-wife interrupts, he gives himself a fatal overdose of an intravenous sedative. Richard, looking for Jonathan to tell him he does not want to go through with the suicide pact, finds his body. He buries Jonathan beside the others. Boyde, increasingly suspicious of the men's behavior, decides to visit the mansion the next morning. She finds a disturbed Richard has covered the inside of the house in artistic recreations of the text of the suicide pact. Richard tells that his friends are dead and then flees in a sports car, leading Boyde on a high speed chase to the Point Sur Lighthouse. When Boyde arrives, she finds Richard's car with the suicide pact on the front seat and Richard near the edge of the ocean cliffs. Boyde attempts to talk Richard away from the edge, but Richard states he would \\"miss his friends too much\\" and jumps. The film ends with the voices of the four friends, each narrating a line from the suicide pact.

It was founded in 1954 in Portland, Oregon by a group of local sailors interested in experimenting with fiberglass sailboat construction. History In 1954 the company was launched by five sailors under the name Yacht Constructors. The first design, the Chinook, came from the desk of well-known Philadelphia naval architect Frederick Geiger, adapted from a wood design. The first five were launched in 1956-1957 to the founders, and began winning local races and gathering attention in the press. Eventually 70 were produced, making it arguably the first production fiberglass sailboat. Robarta A. Smith, a former Sparkman & Stephens designer, would later design a series of boats for the company: * Cascade 29 1961 360 were eventually produced. * Cascade 42 1964 * Cascade 36 1967 * Cascade 23 1977 * Cascade 24 1977 * Cascade 27 1978 Like many early producers of fiberglass boats, the company's production methods resulted in yachts that were heavier than later builders. Experimenting with fiberglass, at that time a relatively novel material for boat construction, the founders made test samples that were shot at from with various firearms to test the material strength. The test samples repelled .45 slugs and became the foundation of the company's reputation for producing bulletproof yachts. In various cases Cascade Yachts have been dropped off slings, fallen off a trailer at highway speed, and submerged in a mudslide, and suffered little consequential damage. Many Cascade hulls were sold in various stages of completion for owners to finish the interiors. In 1989 the company's assets were sold to a new owner who continued production under the name Cascade Yachts. In 2007 the company was sold to Russell Mead and moved to Warrenton, Oregon.

Early life Cameron was baptised in Little Dunkeld in Perthshire, Scotland on 6 January 1800 and was a direct lineal descendant of MacIain Chief of Glencoe. His early years were spent in and around Murthly Castle where he learned carpentry. His father Thomas spent his life in the service of the laird of Murthly. The LMS mission in Madagascar, established in 1820, accepted Cameron's petition to serve five years later when he was 25 years of age.Sibree, J. (Ed.). (1875). \\"The Late Mr. James Cameron: His Life and Labours. A funeral address by Rev. R. Toy,\\" in The Antananarivo Annual and Madagascar Magazine. (1). Antananarivo: L.M.S. Press. Prior to arriving in Madagascar in September 1826 during the reign of the progressive King Radama I, he spent a year in Manchester assisting with the development of machinery which would eventually be installed at Amparibe, Madagascar, to modernize the production of cotton yarn. First mission to Madagascar From Cameron's residence at Ambatonakanga where he constructed the first Christian temple and the first Western-style school in Madagascar, he employed and educated 600 young Malagasy in the construction of machinery and other public works projects. He introduced brick-making in 1826, a technology that was later to be used in a new Malagasy architectural style that was widely adopted throughout the Highlands of Madagascar.Acquier, Jean-Louis. (1997). Architectures de Madagascar. Paris: Berger-Levrault. Cameron's brick house in Ambatonakanga would serve as a model for the new architectural style.Nativel, Didier. (2005). Demeures des Grands a Madagascar. √âditions Karthala, Paris. pp. 76-77 He was instrumental in overseeing the installation of the first printing press on the island, which was used to print a translation of the Bible in the Malagasy language. Cameron was also a key contributor to the manufacture of gunpowder in Imerina and the introduction of hydraulic power drawn Lake Anosy, a man-made lake in the center of modern-day Antananarivo created for this purpose. Upon the death of Radama I in 1828, the accession of his wife, Queen Ranavalona I, to the throne, and her subsequent attempt to rid the island of foreign influence, Christian proselytizing was forbidden and those practicing the new faith were actively persecuted.Matthews, T.T. (1881). Notes of Mission Work in Madagascar. London: Hodder and Stoughton. According to a speech delivered at Cameron's funeral, it was thanks to his intervention that the LMS was able to maintain a presence on the island until 1835, restricted though it might have been: In 1835, pressure on the missionaries had increased to the point that the entire LMS team left the island. Years in South Africa From 1835 to 1863, Cameron continued his missionary activities at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, where he lived with his wife, children, and grandchildren, engaged in commerce and worked as a surveyor to the Corporation of Cape Town. His grandson Hugh MacDonald Cameron was the first registrar of the University of Cape Town. In 1853 the government of Mauritius employed Cameron to successfully negotiate with Ranavalona I regarding the terms of an agreement to restore trade between Madagascar and Mauritius that had been disrupted in 1845 by French and English attacks on the eastern Malagasy trading port of Toamasina. Second mission to Madagascar Ranavalona's death in 1861 and her succession by her son Radama II reopened Madagascar to foreign influence and the activities of Christian missionaries there. Cameron immediately returned and once again undertook a wide variety of secular activities in addition to his continued activities as a missionary. He constructed several buildings on the Rova compound in Antananarivo, including the Manampisoa (1866), a royal tomb (1868) and the stone shell of the Queen's Palace (the Manjakamiadana) in 1869. The towers of the Manjakamiadana were inspired by the original towers of Murthly castle in Scotland where Cameron spent his childhood. He oversaw the construction of the Memorial Church at Faravohitra and another at Analakely, a hospital, several mission houses and village churches, and a water wheel to supply the munitions factory at Anosimahavelona. He was also the first to survey and map Imerina and the region around Fianarantsoa.

McHugh (September 30, 1911 ‚Äì July 5, 1997) was a United States Air Force general, and served as military aide to President John F. Kennedy. Biography =Early years= McHugh was born in Brussels, Belgium, to American parents. He received a baccalaureate in science and languages from the University of Paris in 1929. He was oil production supervisor for the West Texas Production Company in Fort Worth, Texas from 1938 to 1942. =Military posts= After the U.S. entered World War II, McHugh joined the U.S. Army Air Forces as a captain on January 31, 1942 and received pilot training. During the war, he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and was stationed in the European Theater. After the war, he was awarded the Legion of Merit for his service during the war. He served as assistant executive and senior aide to Air Force Chief of Staff General Hoyt S. Vandenberg from 1948 to 1953. He dated Jacqueline Bouvier (who later married John F. Kennedy and became First Lady of the United States). McHugh attended the National War College from 1953 to 1954. =Kennedy administration= He became Air Force Aide to President Kennedy, and was promoted to Brigadier General in 1961. As military aide to the President, his duties included supervising Air Force One. He very often rode in the middle of the front seat of the Presidential State Car while transporting the President. While he was in Dallas, Texas during the John F. Kennedy assassination, McHugh was moved farther back in the motorcade that day rather than riding in the President's car. He was also present during the president's autopsy. After Kennedy's death, McHugh guarded Kennedy's body on Air Force One and until the President's body was returned to Washington, D.C. In a 1978 oral history interview that McHugh gave to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library (that was withheld from the public until 2009), McHugh provided detailed statements that once Kennedy's body was back on board Air Force One he did not know that Lyndon Johnson was also on board. Due to safety concerns that there was a conspiracy, Jacqueline Kennedy's repeated requests, and the fact that the plane's interior cabin was quite warm, McHugh had requested that the plane take off. When the plane still had not taken off, McHugh went forward to again ask pilot James Swindal why the plane had not taken off and he was told that Johnson did not want the plane to take off yet. McHugh went to find Johnson and he soon found Johnson in a bathroom with Johnson saying repeatedly, \\"They're going to get us all. It's a plot. It's a plot. It's going to get us all.\\" According to the General, Johnson \\"was hysterical, sitting down on the john there alone in this thing.\\"Oral History Interview with Godfrey T.

Jordan Marsh incident In the summer of 1963, a pregnant Jacqueline Kennedy was at the Kennedy family compound in Massachusetts. Air Force personnel became concerned that if Mrs. Kennedy were to deliver the child at the Otis Air Force Base hospital, that the maternity ward furniture would be inferior for the newborn of the President and First Lady. The Air Force then spent $5,000.00 of taxpayer money at Jordan Marsh & Company to purchase new furniture, and allowed media photographs of a navy aide standing next to the purchase. After the photos made their way into the Washington Post, an irate President Kennedy telephoned McHugh and ordered him to have the furniture returned.

It is replacing and combining six benefits for working-age people who have a low household income: income-based Employment and Support Allowance, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, and Income Support; Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit; and Housing Benefit. Contributions-based Jobseekers Allowance, Contributions-based Employment and Support Allowance have been replaced with \\"New style\\" versions, and are not affected by Universal Credit. The new policy was announced in 2010 at the Conservative annual conference by the Work and Pensions Secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, who said it would make the social security system fairer to claimants and taxpayers. At the same venue the Welfare Reform Minister, David Freud, Baron Freud, emphasised the scale of their plan, saying it was a \\"once in many generations\\" reform. A government white paper was published in November 2010. A key feature of the proposed new benefit was that unemployment payments would taper off as the recipient moved into work, not suddenly stop, thus avoiding a 'cliff edge' that was said to 'trap' people in unemployment. Universal Credit was legislated for in the Welfare Reform Act 2012. In 2013 the new benefit began to be rolled out gradually to Jobcentres, initially focusing on new claimants with the least complex circumstances: single people who weren't claiming for the cost of their accommodation. There were problems with the early strategic leadership of the project and with the IT system on which Universal Credit relies. Implementation costs, initially forecast to be around ¬£2 billion, later grew to over ¬£12 billion. More than three million recipients of the six older \\"legacy\\" benefits were expected to have transferred to the new system by 2017, but under current plans the full move will not be completed before 2024. One specific concern is that payments are made monthly, with a waiting period of at least five weeks before the first payment, which can particularly affect claimants of Housing Benefit and lead to rent arrears (although claimants can apply for emergency loans paid more promptly). In May 2019 one million people were receiving less than their maximum entitlement, mainly due to overpayment of tax credits under a previous government.Million universal credit households ‚Äòdo not get full entitlement‚Äô The Observer In September 2019, a total of 2.5m people were receiving the benefit; 65% of those recipients were out of work. Background Sir Iain Duncan Smith MP, Work and Pensions Minister between 2010 and 2016 and one of the main architects of the Universal Credit system The Universal Credit mechanism was itself first outlined as a concept in a 2009 report, Dynamic Benefits, by Iain Duncan Smith's thinktank the Centre for Social Justice. It would go on to be described by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith at the Conservative Party annual conference in 2010. The initial aim was for it to be implemented fully over four years and two parliaments, and to merge the six main existing benefits (income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support, Working Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and Housing Benefit) into a single monthly payment, as well as cut the considerable cost of administering six independent benefits, with their associated computer systems. Unlike existing benefits like Income Support, which had a 100% withdrawal rate, Universal Credit was designed to gradually taper away ‚Äì like tax credits and Housing Benefit ‚Äì allowing claimants to take part-time work without losing their entitlement altogether. In theory, it makes claimants better off taking on work, as they keep at least a proportion of the money they earn. But reductions in funding and changes to withdrawal rates left commentators on either side of the debate to question whether it would actually make work pay. The Daily Telegraph claimed \\"part-time work may no longer pay\\", and \\"some people would be better off refusing\\" part-time work and in the Guardian Polly Toynbee wrote \\"Universal credit is simple: work more and get paid less\\". Finally, the \\"Minimum Income Floor\\" used when calculating Universal Credit for self-employed claimants may make it much less worthwhile for large parts of the population to work for themselves. Policy The objectives of the policy included creating a more responsive system that would simplify and incentivise a return to work, pay benefits in a monthly cycle more akin to salaries, reduce the high marginal deduction rate that accumulates from the withdrawal of more than one means-tested benefit simultaneously to a single deduction rate improving incentives, ensure that taking on even a small or varying amount of work would be financially rewarding, and reduce the proportion of children growing up in homes where no one works. Universal Credit would merge out-of-work benefits and in-work support to improve return to work incentives. The clearer financial incentives through Universal Credit would be strengthened by four types of conditionality for claimants depending on their circumstances, ranging from being required to look for full-time work to not being required to find work at all (people in the unconditional group include the severely disabled and carers). Payments are made once a month directly into a bank or building society account, except in Scotland where claimants are given the option to have it paid fortnightly. Any help with rent granted as part of the overall benefit calculation is included in the monthly payment and claimants normally then pay landlords themselves. It is possible in some circumstances to get an Alternative Payment Arrangement (APA), which allows payment of housing benefit direct to the landlord. Universal Credit claimants are also entitled to Personal Budgeting Support (PBS), which is aimed to help them adapt to some of the changes it brings, such as monthly payment. =Major amendments= Post-2015 reductions projected weekly income of a lone parent with 1 child working on the National Living Wage in 2019 with Universal Credit (dark blue), compared to the previous Tax Credits system (light grey). The Universal Credit income planned prior to the 2015 reductions is also shown (light blue). In 2015 the Chancellor, George Osborne, announced a future ¬£3.2 billion a year cut to the overall Universal Credit budget after an attempt to cut Tax Credits that year was thwarted by parliament. The Resolution Foundation has argued that this cut, which will be felt more keenly as millions more people transfer to Universal Credit, risks the new system failing to achieve its original purpose of incentivising work in low-income households. The amendments were: *Reductions in the amount of \\"work allowances\\" before tapered deductions due to income are applied, from April 2016 *Limiting the per-child element to only two children for new claims and births after April 2017 *Removing the extra element for the first child for new claims from April 2017 In November 2016, in response to criticism that the previous changes had reduced incentives to work, the government announced a reduction in the Universal Credit post-tax taper rate, which controls the reduction of Universal Credit as employment income grows, from 65% to 63% of post-tax income, which will ultimately cost ¬£600 million per year. In the 2018 budget the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced an increase in the \\"work allowances\\" for households with children, and people with disabilities, with effect from April 2019, partially reversing the reductions announced in 2015. The post-tax work allowances will increase by ¬£1,000 per year, representing an extra ¬£630 of income for about 2.4 million households in employment, ultimately at a cost of about ¬£1.7 billion per year. Extra transitional support for claimants being moved to Universal Credit was also announced. In April 2020 as a one year temporary response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Universal Credit standard allowance was increased by ¬£20 per week and housing benefit rent limits relaxed. =Relationship to other proposed welfare policies= Universal Credit has some similarities to Lady Williams' idea of a negative income tax, but it should not be confused with the universal basic income policy idea. There is some debate as to whether Universal Credit should be described as \\"universal\\", given it is both subject to income cut-offs and requires some claimants to be available for work. Implementation Universal Credit is part of a package of measures in the Welfare Reform Act 2012, which received Royal Assent on 9 March 2012. The Act delegates its detailed workings to regulations, most of which were published as the Universal Credit Regulations 2013.Statutory Instruments 2013 No. 376, The Universal Credit Regulations 2013 Related regulations appeared in a range of other statutory instruments also. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) announced in February 2012 that Universal Credit would be delivered by selected best-performing DWP and Tax Credit processing centres. Initially, the announcement made clear that local authorities (responsible for administering payment of Housing Benefit, a legacy benefit to be incorporated into the scheme) would not have a significant part in delivering Universal Credit. However, the Government subsequently recognised there may be a useful role for local authorities to play when helping people access services within Universal Credit. Philip Langsdale, Chief Information Officer at DWP, who had been leading the programme, died in December 2012, and in previous months there had also been significant personnel changes. Project Director Hillary Reynolds resigned in March 2013 after just four months, leaving the new Chief Executive of Universal Credit to take on her role.The Register, 11 March 2013, UK's ¬£500m web dole queue project director replaced after JUST 4 months Writing in 2013, Emma Norris of the Institute for Government argued the original timetable for implementation of Universal Credit was \\"hugely overambitious\\", with delays due to IT problems and senior civil servants responsible for the policy changing six times. A staff survey, reported in The Guardian on 2 August 2013, quoted highly critical comments from Universal Credit implementation staff. On 31 October 2013, in another article said to be based on leaked documents, the paper reported that only 25,000 people ‚Äì about 0.2% of all benefit recipients ‚Äì were projected to transfer to the new programme by the time of the next general election in May 2015. In the event, over 100,000 people had made a claim for Universal Credit by May 2015. A pilot in four local authority areas was due to precede national launch of the scheme for new claimants (excluding more complex cases such as families with children), in October 2013, with full implementation to be completed by 2017. Due to persistent computer system failures and delays in implementation, only one pilot, in Ashton-under-Lyne, went ahead by the expected date. The other three pilots went ahead later in the summer, and were met by staff protests. The roll-out of Universal Credit in the Northwest of England was limited to new, single, healthy claimants, later extended to couples, then families, in the same area, reflecting the gradual maturing of different aspects of the computer system. Once the Northwest roll-out was largely complete, the government gradually extended Universal Credit to new single healthy claimants in the rest of the British mainland, nearly completing this roll-out . It was expected that this would gradually be extended to couples and families outside the Northwest once the roll-out to UK mainland single claimants was completed. In Northern Ireland, implementation was held up by disputes over policy and funding between feuding parties in the Northern Ireland assembly; the roll-out of Universal Credit in Northern Ireland began in September 2017. As of 2018 one third of claimants have their benefit reduced to pay rent, council tax and utility bill arrears. This pushed people who already have little further into poverty. Abby Jitendra of the Trussell Trust said this can lead to \\"the tipping point into crisis. (...) Repaying an advance payment, for example, can be an unaffordable expense when taken from a payment that wasn't enough to start with, pushing people further into debt at the time when support is most needed.\\" Gillian Guy of Citizens Advice said, \\"Deductions from universal credit can make it harder for people to get by. People receiving universal credit are unlikely to have much slack in their budgets, so even small amounts can put a huge strain on their finances. Building on last year's improvements to universal credit, the government now needs to ensure deductions are made at a manageable rate and take a person's ability to cover their expenses into account.\\" Charlotte Hughes who advises benefit recipients, said deductions were impossible to predict and often done with no warning. \\"The first time somebody knows that money's been taken out of their account is when they go to the bank. It's just a minefield. Living with that stress that you don't know what money you're going to get from week to week, from month to month, that makes you ill ‚Äì and that's before you can't eat, and before you can't look after your kids properly. It's rampant.\\"Third of UK's universal credit claimants hit by deductions from payments The Observer =Pilots= The scheme was originally planned to begin in April 2013, in four local authorities ‚Äì Tameside (containing Ashton-under-Lyne), Oldham, Wigan and Warrington, with payments being handled by the DWP Bolton Benefit Centre ‚Äì but was later reduced to a single area (Ashton) with the others due to join in July. In Wales, it is known the UC pilot covered new claimants in Brecon in early 2013. The pilot would initially cover only about 300 claims per month for the simplest cases of single people with no dependent children, and was to extend nationally for new claimants with the same circumstances by October, with a gradual transition to be complete by 2017. (One tester of the new system in April noted that the online forms took around 45 minutes to complete, and there was no save function.) In March 2013 it was reportedDerek du Preez, Computerworld UK, 12 March 2013, Universal Credit calculations 'will use spreadsheets' in early rollout that final Universal Credit calculations would be made manually on spreadsheets during the pilot, with the IT system being limited to booking appointments and storing personal details. It was separately reported that no claimants turned up in person at the town hall on the first day of the scheme. The Financial Times reported that the October national roll-out of Universal Credit would now begin in a single Jobcentre (or possibly a \\"cluster\\" of them) in each region and that in December 2012 Hilary Reynolds, who had recently been appointed programme director but had moved shortly thereafter, stated in a letter to local authorities: \\"For the majority of local authorities the impact of [Universal Credit] during the year 2013‚Äì14 will be limited.\\" On 3 December 2013, the DWP issued a report containing statistics which showed that, between April and 30 September, only 2,150 people had been signed up to Universal Credit in the four pilot areas. This report confirmed that Universal Credit had been rolled out to Hammersmith on 28 October, followed by Rugby and Inverness on 25 November, and was to expand to Harrogate, Bath, and Shotton by spring 2014. =Implementation costs= While the DWP had estimated administration costs for the roll-out of Universal Credit to be ¬£2.2 billion, by August 2014 this estimate had risen to ¬£12.8 billion over its \\"lifetime\\" and was later increased again to ¬£15.8 billion. Much of the increased cost was linked with software problems and duplication of systems needed to pay out new and legacy benefits. The initial roll-out proceeded much more slowly than had been originally planned, and led to the early departure of several senior leadership figures. In 2018 the National Audit Office maintained Universal Credit could incur higher administrative costs than the systems it replaces.Universal Credit 'could cost more than current benefits system' BBC A study by the Resolution Foundation published in November 2018 also predicted that Universal Credit will cost more than the older system of benefits it is replacing.Universal credit will cost more than system it replaces, study shows The Guardian In 2020 a National Audit Office report identified ¬£1.4 billion of extra costs up to March 2020 because of the recent two year delay, which included the costs of continuing to run the legacy systems for longer. Per claim administration costs for 2019/2020 were about 10% higher than forecast, though the DWP continued to forecast that eventually administration costs would be 9% lower than the benefits it replaced, however the NAO assessed this was \\"still not certain\\". Fraud and error was estimated at 9.4% (¬£1.7 billion) of payments, higher than the 6.4% forecast. =Current status= Anticipated roll-out progress as at December 2017 In July 2018 the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Damian Green, announced a further 12-month delay to the planned implementation completion date to allow additional contingency time, taking that to 2022. This was the seventh rescheduling since 2013, pushing the implementation completion date to five years later than originally planned. In October 2018, the full rollout of Universal Credit will be delayed again to December 2023. As of February 2016, 364,000 people had made claims for Universal Credit. Government research stated \\"Universal Credit claimants find work quicker, stay in work longer and earn more than the Jobseekers' Allowance claimants.\\" Delays in payments were getting claimants into rent arrears and other debts, however.Universal credit is in 'total disarray', says Labour The Guardian Claimants may wait up to thirteen weeks for their first payment. Tenants can get into rent arrears more frequently on Universal Credit rather than Housing Benefit and many risk eviction and homelessness as a result. Landlords may refuse potential tenants on the benefit and marriages have broken up under the strain of coping with these delays and managing on Universal Credit.Revealed: universal credit sends rent arrears soaring The Observer Frank Field, MP and charities state women have been forced into prostitution because they could not manage during times when Universal Credit payments were delayed.'I was forced into prostitution by Universal Credit' BBC Field stated, \\"If I told people a few years ago that this was happening they would have thought I was off my rocker. I'm still struggling to comprehend it. Women often come to us in tears, they say the benefits system has got worse and they have very little choice.\\"‚ÄòI degraded myself‚Äô: women driven to sex work by benefits system The Guardian Fields also said, \\"I wrote to the secretary of state about how the rollout of universal credit in Birkenhead is not going as well as we‚Äôre told in the House of Commons, with some women taking to the red light district for the first time. Might she [Esther McVey] come to Birkenhead and meet those women's organisations and the police who are worried about women's security being pushed into this position?\\"Women being forced into sex work by universal credit, says MP The Independent In 2019 the Work and Pensions Committee of the House of Commons heard evidence from women claiming they had been forced into prostitution through delays in paying Universal Credit or because Universal Credit payments were insufficient to meet their basic needs. The committee recommended ending the five-week wait for a first payment and, giving vulnerable claimants advances that did not need to be repaid if they would otherwise experience hardship. Universal credit: MPs call for action on women driven to 'survival sex' BBC In April 2018 The Trussell Trust reported that their food banks in areas where universal credit had been rolled out had seen an average 52% rise in demand compared to the previous year. The Trussell Trust fears a big increase in food bank use when Universal Credit is rolled out in April 2019. Emma Revie of Trussell said, \\"We‚Äôre really worried that our network of food banks could see a big increase in people needing help. Leaving 3 million people to wait at least five weeks for a first payment ‚Äì especially when we have already decided they need support through our old benefits or tax credits system ‚Äì is just not good enough. Now is the time for our government to take responsibility for moving people currently on the old system over, and to ensure no one faces a gap in payments when that move happens. Universal credit needs to be ready for anyone who might need its help, and it needs to be ready before the next stage begins.\\"Food bank use will soar after universal credit rollout, warns charity The Guardian Despite May's promise to support those \\"just about managing\\", working homeowners who currently get tax credits lose badly with universal credit. A million homeowners now getting tax credits will have less with the new system and lose on average ¬£43 a week. 600,000 working single parents will lose on average ¬£16 per week and roughly 750,000 households on disability benefits will lose on average ¬£75 per week. Nearly 2 in 5 households receiving benefits will be on average worse off by ¬£52 per week.Millions to lose ¬£52 a week with universal credit, report shows The Observer Up to thirty Conservative MP's are threatening to vote against the government over Universal Credit. Heidi Allen said, \\"Significant numbers of colleagues on my side of the House are saying this isn't right and are coming together to say the chancellor needs to look at this again.\\"Conservative rebels threaten to defeat government unless huge universal credit cuts are stopped The Independent The Resolution Foundation predicts that 400,000 single parents will be better off under universal credit but 600,000 will do worse. The foundation fears lone parents could be trapped in low-paid work with short hours.Conservative party risk ‚Äòdemonising‚Äô single parents with benefits cuts, warns children's commissioner The Independent In January 2019, Amber Rudd, the Work and Pensions Secretary, suspended a planned vote on moving the three million established recipients of older benefits onto Universal Credit. Rudd said that the government would seek approval for the previously announced pilot study of 10,000 such people, who will not see their benefits stopped in the summer of 2019 but have the opportunity to apply for Universal Credit. Rudd also announced that plans to retrospectively extend a benefit cap to families of more than two children born before 2017 would no longer take place. On the same day, the High Court ruled that her department had \\"wrongly interpreted\\" regulations covering the calculation of Universal Credit payments in cases where working claimants' paydays fluctuated. In February 2020, the government announced that the rollout of Universal Credit would be delayed again until September 2024 - nine months later than previously estimated. The Department for Work and Pensions explained that the delay was due to 900,000 more claimants than expected remaining on the legacy welfare schemes that Universal Credit is replacing. The delay is estimated to add more than ¬£500 million to its overall cost. =Support= Support for claimants was initially delivered by local authorities. In October 2018, the Department for Work and Pensions announced that from April 2019, Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland would be provided with ¬£39 million of funding and ¬£12 million in set up costs to deliver Universal Support. In April 2019, this was rebranded as the \\"Help to Claim\\" service and helpline, delivered by Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland. =Unemployment claimant count= Before 2013, the unemployment claimant count was simply the number of people claiming Jobseeker‚Äôs Allowance. However Universal Credit implementation has gradually broadened the groups of people who are required to look for work. For example those that had previously claimed Child Tax Credit or Housing Benefit but not Jobseeker‚Äôs Allowance, such as a person looking after children full time at home with a working partner, were not required to seek work. Under Universal Credit, the partners of claimants are now generally required to seek work. Another example is Universal Credit claimants who would previously have received Employment and Support Allowance, or were awaiting a Work Capability Assessment, are now generally required to look for work. Between November 2015 and November 2019, the number of claimants increased by over 70% (420,000), largely due to such causes. In many areas the claimant count had more than doubled, and in some more that quadrupled. Consequently in 2018 the UK Statistics Authority removed its quality mark from claimant count statistics as it no longer provided a reliable comparator against previous labour market statistics. In 2019 the DWP published an alternative claimant count series, which used modelling to estimate the number of claimants had Universal Credit been fully implemented in 2013, for use in statistical labour market comparison. =Changing monthly pay day= When claimants are paid salary a few days early by employers, for example because of weekends or bank holidays, this can result in two monthly payments in one assessment period and zero in the next. This results in both very uneven Universal Credit payments and lower payments over the complete year because of the cancellation of work allowance for entire months, causing hardship, stress and misery for claimants and additional costs for food banks and other support organisations. Four single mothers, with assistance from the Child Poverty Action Group, took this issue for judicial review at the High Court, which in 2019 ruled the DWP had made a \\"perverse\\" and incorrect interpretation of the 2013 universal credit regulations. The DWP had argued it would be very expensive to change their computer system to fix this problem. In June 2020 the DWP lost an appeal, where it was ruled that this was \\"one of the rare instances where the secretary of state for work and pensions‚Äô refusal to put in place a solution to this very specific problem is so irrational that I have concluded that the threshold is met because no reasonable [minister] would have struck the balance in that way\\". The DWP decided not to appeal further and to modify their systems to comply with the ruling. In July 2020 the DWP lost a further case where the claimant was being paid on a 4-week cycle which interacted badly with the monthly cycle Universal Credit was designed for, causing her to lose up to ¬£463 some months through the incorrect application of the benefit cap. Criticism Universal Credit has been and is subject to many criticisms. Louise Casey fears recipients could become homeless and destitute. According to official figures 24% of new claimants wait over 6 weeks for full payment and many get behind with their rent.Theresa May urged to halt Universal Credit rollout BBC Research by Southwark Council suggests that rent arrears continue when tenants have been on Universal Credit a long time.Universal credit is 'broken' says report highlighting alarming rent arrears The Independent Twelve Tory MPs including Heidi Allen wished the rollout delayed. Local Authorities and recipients of Universal Credit feared claimants will become homeless in large numbers. Gordon Brown maintains, \\"Surely the greatest burning injustice of all is children having to go to school ill-clad and hungry. It is the poverty of the innocent ‚Äì of children too young to know they are not to blame. But the Conservative government lit the torch of this burning injustice and they continue to fan the flames with their ¬£3bn of cuts. A return to poll tax-style chaos in a summer of discontent lies ahead.\\"Halt universal credit or face summer of discontent, Gordon Brown tells PM The Guardian Stephen Bush in The New Statesman maintained that the group currently (October 2017) in receipt of Universal Credit was unrepresentative, consisting mainly of men under 30 who were more likely to find work as they did not have to juggle work obligations with dependent needs. He also argued that men under 30 were also more likely to be living with parents so delays in payments affected them less. Bush believed that when Universal Credit is extended to older claimants and women with dependents, fewer would get back to work easily and there would be more hardship. Johnny Mercer said, \\"Universal credit has the potential to help people out of poverty by removing the disincentives to move into work in the previous system and allowing them to reach their full potential. A modern compassionate Conservative government simply must get it right though. This government can make the system better by smoothing the path from welfare into work with a fresh investment in universal credit in this budget.\\" Mercer backed calls to increase funding for Universal Credit by stopping a plan to cut income tax. Some claimants on Universal Credit feel they cannot get enough to live without resorting to crime.\\"I'm not a criminal, but I have to commit crimes to survive\\": the reality of Universal Credit New Statesman One in five claims for Universal Credit fails because the claimant does not follow the procedure correctly and there are fears this is because the procedure is hard to understand.Complex rules for universal credit see one in five claims fail The Observer Food bank use has increased since Universal Credit started. Delays in providing money force claimants to use food banks, also Universal Credit does not provide enough to cover basic living expenses. Claiming Universal Credit is complex and the system is hard to navigate, many claimants cannot afford internet access and cannot access online help with claiming. A report by the Trussell Trust says, \\"Rather than acting as a service to ensure people do not face destitution, the evidence suggests that for people on the very lowest incomes ... the poor functioning of universal credit can actually push people into a tide of bills, debts and, ultimately, lead them to a food bank. People are falling through the cracks in a system not made to hold them. What little support available is primarily offered by the third sector, whose work is laudable, but cannot be a substitute for a real, nationwide safety net.\\"People with 'nowhere else to turn' fuel rise in food bank use ‚Äì study The Guardian The National Audit Office maintains there is no evidence Universal Credit helps people into work and it is unlikely to provide value for money, the system is in many ways unwieldy and inefficient. There are calls for delays and for the system to be fixed before it is rolled out to millions of further claimants. Margaret Greenwood said, \\"The government is accelerating the rollout in the face of all of the evidence, using human beings as guinea pigs. It must fix the fundamental flaws in universal credit and make sure that vulnerable people are not pushed into poverty because of its policies.\\"Universal credit savaged by public spending watchdog The Guardian Whistleblowers maintain the system is badly designed, broken and glitches regularly lead to hardship for claimants. Hardship can involve delays in benefit payment lasting weeks or reduction in payment by hundreds of pounds below what a claimant is entitled to. A whistleblower said, \\"The IT system on which universal credit is built is so fundamentally broken and poorly designed that it guarantees severe problems with claims.\\" He maintained the system is too complex and error prone, affecting payments, and correction was frequently slow. \\"In practical terms, it is not working the way it was intended and it is having an actively harmful effect on a huge number of claimants.\\" Errors and delays add an average of three weeks to the official 35 day wait for a first payment forcing claimants into debt, rent arrears and to food banks. Campaigners fear the situation could worsen in 2019 when 3 million claimants are moved to the new system. The Department of Work and Pensions is accused of being defensive and insular. One whistleblower said design problems existed due to failure to understand what claimants need, particularly when they do not have digital skills or internet access. He said, \\"We are punishing claimants for not understanding a system that is not built with them in mind.\\"Universal credit IT system 'broken', whistleblowers say The Guardian In October 2018, Sir John Major warned against Universal Credit being introduced \\"too soon and in the wrong circumstances\\". Major argued that people who faced losing out in the short term had to be protected, \\"or you run into the sort of problems the Conservative Party ran into with the poll tax in the late 1980s\\". A report by Bright Blue, funded by Trust for London, recommended that several changes be made to the Universal Credit system. These changes included introducing a Universal Credit app, offering all new Universal Claimants a one off \\"helping hand\\" payment to avoid the five week waiting period and entering claimants who consistently meet conditions around job seeking into a monthly lottery. =Reducing incomes= Multiple organisations have predicted that Universal Credits will cause families with children to be financially worse off. When fully operational, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that 2.1 million families will lose while 1.8 million will gain. Single parents and families with three children will lose an average ¬£200 a month according to the Child Poverty Action Group and the Institute for Public Policy Research. Alison Garnham of the CPAG urged ministers to reverse cuts to work allowances and get Universal Credit, \\"fit for families\\". Garnham said: \\"Universal credit was meant to improve incentives for taking a job while helping working families get better off. But cuts have shredded it. And families with kids will see the biggest income drops.\\" Since 2013 Universal Credit has changed nine times, most changes making it less generous. This includes cuts in work allowances, a freeze in credit rates for four years and (from April 2017)Universal credit hits families with children hardest, study finds The Guardian the child credit being limited to two per family. In October 2017, the Resolution Foundation estimated that that compared to the existing tax credit system: 2.2 million working families would be better off under the Universal Credit system, with an average increase in income of ¬£41 a week. On the other hand, the Foundation estimated that 3.2 million working families would be worse off, with an average loss of ¬£48 a week. In October 2018, the Work and Pensions Secretary, Esther McVey MP, admitted that \\"some people could be worse off on this benefit\\", but argued that the most vulnerable would be protected. In January 2020, a report by the Resolution Foundation found that Universal Credit creates ‚Äúa complex mix of winners and losers‚Äù. It found that in Liverpool, just 32% of families will be better off under Universal Credit, while 52% will be worse off, compared to a national average of 46% losing out, and 39% gaining. =Deductions= Over 60% of claimants experience deductions, many to repay loans they got to tide them over the first five weeks before they officially got payments. Gillian Guy of Citizens Advice said, ‚ÄúOur evidence shows many people on universal credit are struggling to make ends meet, and that deductions are contributing to this.‚Äù She urged the government to start affordability tests before recovering debts from claimants. Neil Couling, the chief of the universal credit programme, ‚Äúadmitted that the government over the last 18 months has demanded a push to recover old debt and has provided UC with extra funds to do this‚Äù. The recovery of debts is causing hardship. =Self-employed claimants= Research by the Low Income Tax Reform Group suggests self-employed claimants could be over ¬£2,000 yearUniversal credit ‚Äòpenalises the self-employed‚Äô report warns The Observer worse off than employed claimants on similar incomes. The problem applies with fluctuating income as Universal Credit assumes a fixed number of hours worked ‚Äì the so- called Minimum Income Floor ‚Äì in its calculation. The government has been urged to change this to allow the self-employed to base claims on their average incomes. Some claimants even could be over ¬£4,000 a year worse off. Some people cannot find work except by being self-employed and such people will be discouraged from starting a business. Frank Field said, \\"Given what we now know about the hundreds of thousands of workers in the gig economy who earn less than the national living wage, it begs the question as to how many grafters and entrepreneurs are going to be further impoverished, or pushed deeper into debt, as a result of this new hole being opened up in the safety net.\\"Universal credit to slash benefits for the self-employed The Observer Citizens Advice maintains that it risks \\"creating or exacerbating financial insecurity for the rising sector of the workforce in non-traditional work\\". People working in their own business will be affected as will those with seasonal work like agriculture and the hotel trade and those with varying overtime pay. 4.5 million people do work with varying hours while 4.8 million are self-employed most receiving in work benefits. =Online applications= Professor John Seddon, an author and occupational psychologist, began a campaign in January 2011 for an alternative way to deliver Universal Credit, arguing it wasn't possible to deliver high-variety services through \\"cheaper\\" transaction channels, and would drive costs up. He wrote an open letter to Iain Duncan Smith and Lord Freud as part of a campaign to call halt to current plans and embark instead on a \\"systems approach\\". Seddon also launched a petition calling for Duncan Smith to: \\"rethink the centralised, IT-dominated service design for the delivery of Universal Credit\\". Professor Phillip Alston (the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights) visited the UK in 2018 to report on the impact that the austerity measures implemented since 2010 had had on the disabled and reported that the universal credit digital system had been designed to be difficult.https://undocs.org/A/HRC/41/39/Add.1 His report has prompted academics to call for complementary non-digital services.http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/how-technology- has-been-used-to-deny-benefits-to-the-disabled Echoing these concerns, Ronnie Campbell, MP for Blyth Valley, sponsored an Early Day Motion on 13 June 2011 on the delivery of Universal Credit which was signed by thirty MPs: \\"That this House notes that since only fifteen per cent of people in deprived areas have used a Government website in the last year, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) may find that more Universal Credit customers than expected will turn to face-to-face and telephone help from their local authority, DWP helplines, Government-funded welfare organisations, councillors and their Hon. Member as they find that the automated system is not able to deal with their individual questions, particular concerns and unique set of circumstances\\". =Wait for payments and payment frequency= The Trades Union Congress has raised concerns about the delay ‚Äì which is at least six weeks ‚Äì between making a claim and receiving money. The Work and Pensions Select Committee said waiting six-weeks for the first payment caused \\"acute financial difficulty\\". Reducing the delay would make the policy more likely to succeed.Universal credit: MPs urge government to cut waiting time BBC Some claimants must wait eight months for their first payment. About 20% waited nearly five months and roughly 8% had to wait for eight months. Committee Chair, Frank Field said, \\"Such a long wait bears no relation to anyone's working life and the terrible hardship it has been proven to cause actually makes it more difficult for people to find work. \\"Universal credit: six-week wait key obstacle to its success, MPs say The Guardian According to a report in The Guardian, thousands of claimants get into debt, get behind with their rent and risk eviction due to flaws in Universal Credit. Landlords and politicians want the system overhauled.Universal credit flaws pushing and eviction The Guardian Due to ongoing problems an official inquiryMPs launch official inquiry into universal credit as criticism grows The Guardian has been launched into Universal Credit. In October 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May said the six-week delay would continue,PM will not reduce six-week wait for universal credit despite MPs‚Äô warnings The Guardian despite the concerns of many MPs including some in her own party. A study Universal credit behind rising rent arrears and food bank use, 'guinea pig' councils say The Guardian for Southwark and Croydon councils found substantial increase in indebtedness and rent arrears among claimants on Universal Credit compared with claimants on the old system. Referrals to food banks increased, in one case by 97 per cent. End Hunger UK, a coalition of poverty charities and faith organizations said payment delays, administrative mistakes and failure to support claimants having difficulties with the online only system forced up food bank use. End Hunger UK urged ministers to do a systematic study of how universal credit affects claimants‚Äô financial security. End Hunger UK urged a large cut in the time claimants wait for their first payment from at least five weeks to only two weeks, and maintain the long wait is financially crippling for claimants without savings. The Trussell Trust found demand for food aid rose an average of a 52% in universal credit areas in 2017, contrasted with 13% in areas where it had not been introduced. \\"It is simply wrong that so many families are forced to use food banks and are getting into serious debt because of the ongoing failings in the benefits system,\\" said Paul Butler, Bishop of Durham.Anti-poverty coalition calls for overhaul of universal credit The Guardian Claimants with children who start work must pay child care early and wait for Universal Credit to repay them later, the Work and Pensions Select Committee reported. The WPSC maintains this is a, \\"barrier to work\\". According to the report, \\"Universal Credit claimants must pay for childcare up front and claim reimbursement from the department after the childcare has been provided. This can leave households waiting weeks or even months to be paid back. Many of those households will be in precarious financial positions which Universal Credit could exacerbate: if, for example, they have fallen into debt or rent arrears while awaiting Universal Credit payments. Too many will face a stark choice: turn down a job offer, or get themselves into debt in order to pay for childcare.\\" The WPSC maintains ministers should pay universal credit childcare costs directly to childcare providers. This would take the burden away from parents and give providers a more certain incomes. Frank Field said, \\"It's not just driving parents into despair and debt and creating problems for childcare providers - it's also actively working to prevent the government achieving its own aim of getting more people into work.\\"Get in debt or turn down job? Universal Credit's 'stark choice' BBCUniversal credit childcare is hurting the poorest, MPs warn The Observer The High Court ruled in January 2019 that the DWP \\"wrongly interpreted\\" regulations covering the calculation of Universal Credit payments in cases where working claimants' paydays fluctuated. The DWP's interpretation had meant receiving a salary a few days early because of a weekend or bank holiday \\"vastly reduced\\" one's universal credit payment, a situation the judges described as \\"odd in the extreme\\" that \\"could be said to lead to nonsensical situations\\". The DWP had defended this anomaly by saying that changing its automated system would be expensive. The Child Poverty Action Group said the anomaly had caused \\"untold hardship, stress and misery\\" and forced one of the working single mothers in the case to rely on food banks, despite requiring fresh fruit and vegetables due to pregnancy. In February 2019, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Amber Rudd, conceded that \\"there were challenges with the initial roll-out of universal credit. The main issue which led to an increase in food bank use could have been the fact that people had difficulty accessing their money early enough\\". Rudd went on to explain that \\"We have made changes to accessing universal credit so that people can have advances, so that there is a legacy run-on after two weeks of housing benefit, and we believe that will help with food and security\\". =Direct payments to tenants= Direct payment of the housing component of Universal Credit (formerly Housing Benefit) to tenants has been the subject of controversy. Although Housing Benefit has long been paid to most private sector tenants directly, for social housing tenants it has historically been paid directly to their landlords. As a result, implementation of a social housing equivalent to the Local Housing Allowance policy, which has been present in the private sector without comment for over a decade, has widely been perceived as a tax on having extra bedrooms, rather than the tenant making up a shortfall in the rent arising from a standardisation of their level of benefit. The Social Security Advisory Committee have argued that the policy of direct payments requires \\"close monitoring\\" so as to make sure Universal Credit does not further discourage landlords from renting to people on benefits. =Disincentive to save= The Institute for Fiscal Studies has argued that Universal Credit is a disincentive for people to save money. =Impact on the self-employed= The Resolution Foundation has warned that Universal Credit will have a detrimental effect on self-employed people, because the level of Universal Credit awarded does not fully take account of any dramatic changes in their income from month to month. According to the Child Poverty Action Group, Universal Credit may the low-paid self-employed and anyone who makes a tax loss (spends more on tax-deductible expenses than they receive in taxable income) in a given tax year. =Impact on disabled people= Citizens Advice research argued that 450,000 disabled people and their families would be worse off under universal credit. The Work and Pensions Select Committee found Universal Credit's system of sanctions to be \\"pointlessly cruel\\", and asked for Universal Credit to be put on hold till it is clear that very vulnerable disabled claimants are protected from serious income loss. Single disabled people in employment were found to be ¬£300 per month worse off when moved on to Universal Credit. Claimants risk being isolated, destitute and in some cases forced to rely on dependent children for care, according to the committee.Put universal credit on hold to protect disabled claimants, say MPs The Guardian =Impact on passported benefits= The Daily Mirror reported an example of a claimant who was moved over to Universal Credit from a \\"legacy benefit\\" and whose passported benefits, such as free school meals, were withdrawn in error. =Domestic abuse= Universal Credit payments go to one person in each household, so abuse victims and their children are often left dependent according to a Work and Pensions Committee report and abusers can exert financial control. It is feared this can facilitate abuse and enable bullying. Financial abuse is also facilitated, one abuse survivor said to the committee that \\"[the abusive partner] will wake up one morning with ¬£1,500 in his account and piss off with it, leaving us with nothing for weeks.\\" Committee chair, Frank Field said, \\"This is not the 1950s. Men and women work independently, pay taxes as individuals, and should each have an independent income. Not only does UC's single household payment bear no relation to the world of work, it is out of step with modern life and turns back the clock on decades of hard-won equality for women.\\" MPs listened to evidence that abuse victims found the whole of their income, including money intended for the children, went into the abuser's bank account. The report noted the single household payment caused difficulties for victims wanting to leave and said, \\"there is a serious risk of Universal Credit increasing the powers of abusers\\". The report called for all Job Centres to have a private room where people at risk of abuse could state their concerns confidentially. There should also be a domestic abuse specialist in each Job Centre who could alert other staff to signs of abuse. Scotland wants to split payments by default but needs the DWP to change the IT system. The report wants the department to work with Scotland and test a new split payment system. Katie Ghose of Women's Aid called on the government to implement the report and stated, \\"It is clear from this report that there are major concerns about the safety of Universal Credit in cases where there is domestic abuse.\\"Universal Credit hands power to abusers, MPs say BBCUniversal credit payments at risk of being used by abusers, MPs say The Guardian The campaign group Women's Aid have argued that as Universal Credit benefits are paid as a single payment to the household, this has negative consequences for victims of domestic abuse. The Guardian also argued the change disempowers women, preventing them from being financially independent.Universal credit doesn't reward hard work. It makes the most vulnerable pay The Guardian Women's Aid and the TUC jointly did research showing 52 per cent of victims living with their abuser claimed financial abuse prevented them from leaving. Under Universal Credit when a couple separates, one person must inform the DWP, and make a fresh claim, which takes at least five weeks to process. Someone without money, and possibly with children cannot manage such a wait. Katie Ghose said, \\"We're really concerned that the implications for women for whom financial abuse is an issue have not been fully thought through or appreciated by the government.\\" Jess Phillips stated, \\"What we are doing is essentially eliminating the tiny bit of financial independence that at woman might have had.\\" And, she added, the DWP keeps no data on whether Universal Credit goes to men or to women, therefore the magnitude of the problem cannot be measured.A woman with no resources is a woman who can't leave: why Universal Credit is a feminist issue New Statesman =Impact on families= In the report Pop Goes the Payslip the advice organisation Citizens Advice highlighted examples of people in work worse off under Universal Credit than under the 'legacy' benefits it replaces. Similarly, a report from 2012 by Save the Children highlights how \\"a single parent with two children, working full- time on or around the minimum wage, could be as much as ¬£2,500 a year worse\\". Gingerbread has also highlighted their concerns over Universal Credit's disproportional impact on single parent families in particular. As of August 2018, 25% of all recipients were lone parents, with 90% of all single parent families eligible for Universal Credit when the benefit is fully rolled out. Single parents make up the overwhelming majority of claimants affected by the Benefit Cap under Universal Credit: 73% of capped households are headed by single parents, while 75% of those have a child under five \\\\- a fact which greatly impacts their ability to find suitable work. =Work disincentives= A House of Commons Library briefing note raised the concern that changes to Universal Credit that were scheduled to take effect in April 2016 might make people reluctant to take more hours at work: > There is concern that families transferring to Universal Credit as part of > the managed migration whose entitlement to UC is substantially lower than > their existing benefits and tax credits might be reluctant to move into work > or increase their hours if this would trigger a loss of transitional > protection, thereby undermining the UC incentives structure. The very long application and assessment hiatus also discourages UC recipients from moving off Universal Credit entirely, for more than six months, fearful having to undergo repeated and very long waiting periods, with no income, resulting because of redundancy and/or loss of temporary employment for legitimate reasons necessitating reapplication for Universal Credit from scratch. In 2015, the Chancellor announced a future ¬£3.2 billion a year cut to the Universal Credit budget after an attempt to cut Tax Credits that year was thwarted by parliament. The Resolution Foundation has argued that this cut risks the new system failing to achieve its original purpose of incentivising work in low-income households. The 2015 cut was partly reversed in the 2018 budget by a promised uplift of ¬£1.7 billion per year to the money available to encourage recipients to increase their hours at work. =Internal criticisms= A freedom of information request was made by Tony Collins and John Slater in 2012. They sought the publication of documents detailing envisioned problems, problems that arose with implementation, and a high-level review. In March 2016, a third judicial case ordered the DWP to release the documents. The government's argument against releasing the documents was the possibility of a chilling effect for the DWP and other government departments. =IT problems= Universal Credit has been dogged by IT problems. A DWP whistleblower told Channel 4's Dispatches in 2014 that the computer system was \\"completely unworkable\\", \\"badly designed\\" and \\"out of date\\". A 2015 survey of Universal Credit staff found that 90% considered the IT system inadequate. =Telephone problems= Claimants on low income were forced to pay for long telephone calls. Citizens Advice in England carried out a survey in summer 2017 which found an average waiting time of 39 minutes with claimants often needing to make repeated calls. Nearly a third of respondents said they made over 10 calls. The government was urged to make telephone calls over Universal Credit free for claimantsPressure grows to make universal credit helpline free of charge The Guardian which was done in 2019. =ID requirements= In December 2018, Liverpool Walton MP Dan Carden wrote to Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Amber Rudd, to raise concerns after a number of people claiming Universal Credit were told to apply for provisional driving licences as a form of ID, with the costs being taken from their benefits. In response to the letter a DWP spokesperson said that \\"having ID is not a requirement for those making a Universal Credit claim\\", though this appeared to contradict the guidance on the government's website. = Fraud = It was originally hoped that Universal Credit would help to save about ¬£1bn in fraud and error. However, in July 2019 it was revealed that an estimated ¬£20 million of public money had been stolen by fraudsters. Criminals were found to be exploiting a loophole in the online system to fraudulently apply for universal credit and claiming advance loans on behalf of other people who were unaware that they had been signed up for the benefit. One jobcentre reported that ¬£100,000 of fraudulent activity had been recorded each month. It was estimated that 42,000 people may have fallen victim to the scam. Following the revelations, the Work and Pensions minister Justin Tomlinson announced that \\"where it is clear that they have been a victim of fraud through no fault of their own, no, we would not expect them to pay it back.\\" A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions later explained that victims of the scam would have to repay any money that they had kept. = Mental health = A study by The Lancet Public Health Journal released in February 2020 linked a sharp increase in mental- health problems among the unemployed with the rollout of Universal Credit and other government welfare changes. It found that the amount of unemployed people with psychological distress rose by 6.6% from 2013‚Äì2018.
